Hi All

IMP can be configure to talk to as many different Pop/imap hosts a you like.
The long problem is that by default the package allow uses to set the host
and protocol, this is a risk because any one could use the server to talk to
any other mail server.

This is easily fixed, by editing the defaults.php3 and servers.php3 to lock
the server list down


Cheers

Subject: RE: Linux (Debian) WebMail


&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't mean a webmail client, I mean the php/cgi/whatever code that
&gt; &gt; &gt; runs on apache that gives you a webmail interface that you can then
use
&gt; &gt; &gt; from any web browser.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Er, it's usually all the same. I'm yet to see a piece of webmail
&gt; &gt; software that says "Here's the underlying code. Go write some HTML for
&gt; &gt; the frontend".
&gt;
&gt; I think there has been some miscommunication here.
&gt;
&gt; The "webmail software" that I originally spake of is something like IMP,
&gt; Twig or SquirrelMail. It's the php/html/etc guff that uses Apache to talk
&gt; http to a browser, and imap/pop/smtp to talk to a mail server (basically,
&gt; it's the MUA). Sometimes they have some of the mail server functionality
&gt; built in. I want the php/html guff to run on Apache, which is on a debian
&gt; server.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the solaris box stores the mail, runs sendmail for SMTP, and has a
POP3
&gt; &gt; &gt; and an IMAP server. The debian box is the gateway. It  runs postfix. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; want it to run a webmail service so people can  connect from outside,
&gt; &gt; &gt; thruogh it, to their internal mailboxes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; OK. I'm a little puzzled by your choice to run Postfix on the gateway,
&gt; &gt; as it could be easily installed on Solaris. Use NAT to do the rest of
&gt; &gt; the work.
&gt;
&gt; There are reasons, many of them historical. I could explain them if you
&gt; want, but I think that's a whole other pair of pants (to coin a phrase,
&gt; whose meaning I am not entirely certain of)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will use eitehr the postrfix on the debian server or the sendmail on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the solaris server. Haven't dexcided which yet, suppose it matters
&gt; &gt; &gt; little.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Telling it to use SMTP Server x.x.x.x will be a pain. Most mail clients
&gt; &gt; that I've looked into use /usr/bin/sendmail to, er, send the mail ;-)
&gt;
&gt; some don't.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; You're right, though. It matters little.
&gt;
&gt; eitehr way, it should be ok.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "I doubt that dpkg (...)." is not the most complete sentence I have
seen
&gt; &gt; &gt; on this list...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Whoops! Got sidetracked when I wrote that sentence :-) I doubt that dpkg
&gt; &gt; (or whatever it is called in Debian land) would be capable of doing all
&gt; &gt; the various configuration bits to get IMP working.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That said, dpkg may be able to call a script that does the work, but I
&gt; &gt; doubt anyone could be bothered doing any such thing.
&gt;
&gt; ideally, I want one that I install, it runs a script, asks me where the
&gt; /usr/bin/sendmail or smtp server is, where the imap/pop server is, and
then
&gt; goes...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; yeah, I'd rather not bother with SQL -- all I really want is a http to
&gt; &gt; &gt; imap/smtp gateway, with no local storage of mail, no local
&gt; &gt; &gt; authentication info, little local config, and easily apt-getted
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; IMAP/POP will handle user authentication in IMP, as it does in most web
&gt; &gt; mail clients around. SQL isn't really that bad. MySQL can be easilly
&gt; &gt; configured to take up little amounts of resources and
&gt; &gt; compiling/installing is a sinch.
&gt;
&gt; it just seems pointless -- I can't see much information that really
requires
&gt; persistent storage on the MUA side...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The "local config" for IMP is simply a matter of editing some basic
&gt; &gt; variables in a configuration file, then opening "setup.php3" in your
&gt; &gt; browser. This automatically generates the "defaults.php3" file from the
&gt; &gt; information you provide a nice, shiny web-based interface.
&gt;
&gt; mmm... I'll look into it (though I'm still not happy with having to
install
&gt; a database)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; imp uses the database to store runtime info? yuck.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; cross that off my list...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; With PHP3, there was no in-built session handling. Those who required
&gt; &gt; such a feature were forced to use bulky, unfriendly toolkits like
&gt; &gt; PHPLib, which can use a database to store session data.
&gt;
&gt; mmm....... true...
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd not go crossing it off my list immediately, though. Have a look at
&gt; &gt; the demo site, <A HREF="http://demo.horde.org/.">http://demo.horde.org/.</A> That'll give you an idea of its
&gt; &gt; capabilities.
&gt;
&gt; yep...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If you want a nice, slick, slim web-based email environment, I'd
&gt; &gt; strongly recommend you take a look at SquirrelMail. Installing is a
&gt; &gt; simple matter of un-taring and running 'configure'. 'configure' is
&gt; &gt; actually a menu-driven configuration system which lets you specify the
&gt; &gt; necessary bits and pieces. It's on SourceForge somewhere.
&gt;
&gt; yes, I've heard this is good. unfortunately, it has no apt sources, which
is
&gt; not prohibitive, but irritating.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; One of the big advantages that SquirrelMail has over IMP is its complete
&gt; &gt; lack of bulk. IMP is designed to be a complete mail solution, with all
&gt; &gt; the bells and whistles (2.4 has some *cool* features). SquirrelMail is
&gt; &gt; also written in PHP4, which has inbuilt session handling features.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The long and the short of it is that SquirrelMail needs only an IMAP
&gt; &gt; server and a PHP4-capable webserver. It's easy, fast and reliable.
&gt;
&gt; and an MTA? or does it do its' own?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I used to use it on <A HREF="http://mail.plug.cx/,">http://mail.plug.cx/,</A> until I saw the light and used
&gt; &gt; Mutt over an SSH session when I needed my mail from afar :-)
&gt;
&gt; indeed -- no good for non-techos though...
