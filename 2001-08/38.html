No, DONT use DivX.. gah.. its a bastardised version of MPEG4, that MS used
for ASF, that got ported (illegally) to .avi.

Sure, it works, but microsoft are loving the way their "embraced and
extended" version of mpeg is being taken up.

Just use MPEG! It's standard, its open, it works well, and it isn't tainted
by Micro$oft.

M$ sent their lawyers to virtualdub (open-source video editor) when he added
support, and they're likely to do the same for any other open-source
versions ONCE THEY GET POPULAR.

m$ want to get divx the popular standard, just so long as all the best
players are on windows..

and they even have an upgrade path for ppl who want a few percent more
compression, etc.. in the form of WMV5/6/7.. (divx was wmv4 i think)

Using DIVX to distribute movies is like using .CAB instead of tar/gzip/bzip2
or .zip, etc..

&gt; &gt; I'll see if I can get another format arranged. Currently I have the
&gt; &gt; choice of an even more windows specific file at twice the size that I
&gt; &gt; can't open for nuts, or a 380 megabyte source AVI file which plays
&gt; &gt; wonderfully, if you don't mind waiting for the download :)
&gt;
&gt; How about DivX;-).
