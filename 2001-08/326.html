&gt;&gt; That's the rub.  A well placed printf() speaks volumes about your

&gt; Oh come on.

"Two words:  'Mellow out, man.'"

&gt; A breakpoint shows exactly the same understanding

Agreed.  It might be just me, but I've seen more
people randomly debugging with debuggers (maybe they'd
do the same with printf ... hey, it's _my_ debugging
tool of choice - get yer own.  Oh, that's right, you
did :-).

&gt; and avoids a stack of source code control issues.

Possibly.  My non trivial programs are generally under
source code control anyway, so if I'm non-trivially
debugging, I'll usually check out a fresh copy of it
anyway (have to, if it's occurred with something several
revisions old :-).

&gt; If you are going to use it then use the form
&gt; 
&gt;   #if 1
&gt;       printf()
&gt;   #endif

I don't code religously in C any more, so I can't remember
if I used to use the form:

#define DEBUG 1

#if DEBUG
   printf()
#endif

or

#define DEBUG

#ifdef DEBUG
   printf()
#endif

I suspect the latter, because that one is easier to drive
from the command line/make (ie, requires -DDEBUG vs. -DDEBUG=0/
-DDEBUG=1 regardless).  Again, That's Just Me.

&gt; If you want to design programs for test, then allow
&gt; a unit test of each module by defining MAIN;

I usually had separate test driver programs that were linked
against whatever needed testing (bar main()).  I tried to keep
main() as simple as possible, but no simpler.  Didn't always
succeed, though.

&gt; use assert() freely;

Agreed, assert is a great tool.  Just don't ship any libraries
with it enabled.

&gt;&gt; It's how C programs were "traditionally" debugged.

&gt; One of the huge original attractions of UNIX was
&gt; the Programmers' Work Bench -- adb, sccs, prof, tcov.

Never had those in my formative Unix upbringing, unfortunately.
The people who I coded for I think had "appropriated" their
software, because the man pages kept referring to programs and
libraries that didn't exist.  Discovering RCS in my early
twenties was quite a revelation.

&gt; I haven't used DDD, but if you are simply after an easier-
&gt; to-drive gdb then I can recommend gdb-highlight for
&gt; XEmacs.  Assuming you are familiar with Emacs.

Can I get that for Vi, or is that a whole other religious war?  :-)
