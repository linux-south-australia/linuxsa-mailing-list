&gt; is it possible to set linux to log in to root without asking for login and password
&gt; details, as im using it for an arcade machine and do not require login.
&gt; the system is debian 2.2

It's more than possible to automatically log in as any user.
UNIX was origianlly deployed in telco exchanges and that
feature was essential.

I wouldn't recommend that user being root, use an less powerful
user instead.  Not using root also makes development easier.

In text mode, you simply run the application directly from
/etc/inittab with an entry like:

  a1:respawn:/opt/application/bin/myapp tty1

A useful variant of "myapp" is "autologin" at

  <A HREF="http://people.redhat.com/alikins/ltsp/autologin/">http://people.redhat.com/alikins/ltsp/autologin/</A>

which drops the user into a shell.  You could change
/etc/passwd and /etc/shells to drop the user into your
program.

This also applies if your application uses svgalib.

In X mode, you want to bypass the XDM login but retain
the rest of XDM's functions.  XDM doesn't allow this,
but there's a patch at:

  <A HREF="http://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/~ob6/sw/xautolog.html">http://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/~ob6/sw/xautolog.html</A>

This might have been rolled into XFree4, it would
be worthwhile trying the configuration commands.

KDE's KDM also does autologin as does GNOME's GDM.
From memory neither allow autologin for the root
user.

In Red Hat Linux you can also avoid the *DMs altogether
by creating a file /etc/sysconfig/autologin.  It's
probably better to use the *DMs for a game as that
would make development easier.

Last but not least, you can always alter /etc/inittab
to change the program that starts X to one of your
choosing.  As this is essentially writing your own
display manager; it's probably not the best way to go.
