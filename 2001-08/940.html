&gt; Alan, I'd like to introcude you to the concept of "reality". 

&lt;snip&gt;

apologies for the tone of that last email -- It wasn't meant to be insulting, it just happened that way... I'll write it again...

If those things mattered to you, and you could afford to have them in your own facility, you would have to have a very large IT budget (it's cheaper to share someone else's gear than to do it yourself), and quite a _lot_ of staff to run all the guff. Realistically, to afford to do that, you'd either have to be a very big site, or be prepared to make it more a labour of love than a business. Also, you'd want to be a particularly stable business, because if you grow too big for your office, you may have to move your facilities, and that involves expense and downtime... Someone else is more likely to have a stable facility, which will not stop your office from growing...

&gt; &gt; An example of this is the total fiasco of
&gt; &gt; www.theregister.co.uk in the last 2 weeks.
&gt; 
There's plenty of couter-examples though... Yes, there can be problems with colocation, but everything in business is a compromise, and if it wasn't that problem, it would be something else... each business just has to weigh up what it requires, what it can afford, and what the risks are, and make a decision based on that. This can differ markedly for different businesses.

&gt; &gt; The collocated with a big facility in London with
&gt; &gt; all you mention plus much more.
&gt; &gt; (From memory, it was level3 or something.)
&gt; &gt; But when their system failed, it was a huge saga
&gt; &gt; to get the thing going again, which was very substantially
&gt; &gt; _hindered_ by the fact that it was all in a secure facility.

There's always a compromise. If they were in their own facilities, they would have discovered that something else was a critical problem. As I said, it's all about balancing the costs, benefits and risks -- some businesses can afford the risk of the above, but couldn't afford "minor" monthly outages...


&gt; &gt; In their own offices, there would have been no problem.

In their own offices, access to their facilities wouldn't have been a problem. they most certainly would have had other problems.

&gt; &gt; Right now, I can't get through to their site again.
&gt; &gt; If they had been using a modest machine in their own
&gt; &gt; offices (above a cafe or something), they would not
&gt; &gt; have had these very damaging outages.

But, a "modest machine" above a cafe somewhere may not be able to cope with the demand... Of course, it's quite possible that The Register stuffed up, and really should have used a modest machine in an office, but that doesn't mean that everyone should... I'm sure that you'd agree that the outage you mention is less serious than never being able to get to their site because their server or link is always overloaded, and the power goes out occasionally...

&gt; &gt; Also, 300 GBytes/month = approx 1 Mbit/sec, which is
&gt; &gt; not so difficult for an SME to afford these days.
&gt; 
It's harder to afford if it needs to be reliable, and cope with the bursty nature of internet communication. They won't be serving a constant 1 Mbit/sec. They would be more likely to fluctuate between a few K/sec and 100Mbit/sec... and that's expensive... particularly if they want to be available for those mad peaks when they get /.ed or something... (if /.ing is significant to them -- it may be no more than a blip)

&gt; &gt; I serve 35,000 visits per month with just 15% of
&gt; &gt; my 33k link. That's 1400 MBytes/month.

15% constantly? or 100% for 15% of the time? Is your site mission critical? (I doubt it) does it matter to you that someone may get no (or slow) response becaause there are three people accessing your site simultaneously? What you're saying here is that your setup suits your needs, and that's great. It doesn't suit mine. It also doesn't suit my client's needs.

&gt; &gt; How many SMEs need to serve 35,000 visits a month?
&gt; &gt; Obviously a 1 Mbit/sec link would get me
&gt; &gt; 1 million visits per month.

Some do way more... some want to plan for growth. Some have reasons for colocating other than bandwidth...

&gt; &gt; I still think that the ideal internet presence for
&gt; &gt; 99% of businesses is a linux box and a 33k modem.

That's because you assume that 99% of businesses are like yours. The ideal for 50% of businesses is no internet presence at all. Maybe another 25% could be like you... Then there are businesses who have other requirements and other budgets...

&gt; &gt; I really wish their site would come up so that I
&gt; &gt; can get you the link to their fiasco description.
&gt; &gt; After they posted a very long description, the
&gt; &gt; problem has persisted.
&gt; &gt; This gives some idea of their problems though:
&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph/?mode_u">http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph/?mode_u</A>=off&mode_w=on&site=www.theregister.co.uk
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But for companies with no IT staff, I guess the
&gt; &gt; hosting service is the way to go!

and for companies with many IT staff, with different requirements...

There is no one solution that will suit everyone, or even most people... It just doesn't happen. Some businesses will put a high value on having someone else doing this (so that they can focus on their own business, or so they have someone else to blame/sue)... some businesses don't want to put the capital investment in. Some don't have the skills to tell a modem from a keyboard. For some, the server facility needs to be physically larger than their office. For some, it needs to be geographically distributed. Some want a low-utilisation, high bandwidth connection, as they have 1 visitor per day, but they don't want that visitor to be waiting for their modem... Some don't want their office link flooded with web traffic... etc...
