&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I need to get some advice with smbd.
&gt; I have setup smbd 2.0.7 on a redhat 6.2 install to make a file server
&gt; for our windows network.
&gt; all is working fine with getting the shares working using swat,
&gt; everything sweet.
&gt; 
&gt; what I notice is that when it creates the files/folders they are all
&gt; given permissions for root.%user
&gt; 
&gt; now this hasnt been a problem until now, as its a private network, but I
&gt; have just made another smbd share which is also mounted using nfs, to a
&gt; folder on our firewall, so we can then sftp in and transfer files
&gt; between home and our private network. (couldnt be bothered with VPN or
&gt; port forwarding as I was trying to reduce external services/open ports)
&gt; 
&gt; what I have been trying to do is to change the default permissions smbd
&gt; applies to new files (probably all files/folders) so as to not be
&gt; transferring any files with root permissions.
&gt; I have create a user and group, smbnoone.smbnogrp and then tried using
&gt; the users map feature of samba so all users were then mapped to the one
&gt; user. the file is very simple and is written like;
&gt; 
&gt; smbnoone = nick brett dave luke
&gt; 
&gt; I have added the user smbnoone and a suitable passwd to samba and set it
&gt; as active, but when I then tell samba to use the smbusers.map file all
&gt; the shares stop and smbd doesnt accept any passwords for any users
&gt; nick brett dave luke or smbnoone
&gt; as soon as I remove the reference to the smbusers.map file from the
&gt; smb.conf everything back to normal.
&gt; 
&gt; can anyone suggest a better way of making samba create files with
&gt; minimal permissions or spot what I may be doing wrong here

Someone already mentioned the 'create mask' smb.conf option (which is a
share-level option, rather than global). I would also have a look at
'inherit permissions', which allows you to set the permissions on a
directory and everything created below that directory inherits the
permissions from it's parent. I don't know if this presents much of a
security problem, but it's also possible to setgid a directory. Anything
created below that directory will be owned by the group that owns the
directory.

Other smb.conf options to RTFM:

[share level options]
 directory *
 force *
 inherit permissions
 map *
 security mask

DANGER! HERE BE DRAGONS! Just make sure you fully understand what you're
doing before you actually implement these in production, as it is
possible to give some people too much control over shares with the
greatest of ease. Also be wary of using some of these options inside the
[homes] share.

Hope it helps,
Matt
