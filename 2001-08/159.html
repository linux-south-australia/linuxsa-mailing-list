There was a slashdot discussion on this about 2 years ago:
<A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/askslashdot/99/09/26/1550254.shtml">http://www.slashdot.org/askslashdot/99/09/26/1550254.shtml</A>

They say that basically KDE does require Qt and Gnome does require GTK.

But I think this means only that if you want to write KDE-specific
apps, then you need the Qt library.
And to write gnome-specific apps, you need the GTK/GDK/glib library.
That agrees with what I'm reading in a book on this
subject right now too. (I won't mention the title - it's in french.)

However, as I understand it, most apps from each environment will
interwork with the windows managers of the other.

It seems like there are about 3 levels of functionality in
the X windows system for linux:

1.	Basic drawing at the Xlib level, which corresponds to
	the GDK. This include drawing lines, opening windows,
	and such basic stuff.

2.	Toolkit functionality: this includes things like
	slide bars, gamma graphs, menus etc.
	This is done by GTK. In the KDE model, Qt does
	the combination of levels 1 and 2.

3.	Inter-application communication. This was not in the
	original X spec from MIT. The idea here is that
	apps can communicate things like clipboard info to
	each other, and a spreadsheed app can communicate with
	a word processor as in the wind32 model.
	This uses things like Corba for communications.
	I've heard that there have been discussions between the
	KDE and gnome worlds to try to harmonize the
	two communications conventions used.

So ultimately it comes down to this:

If you're a developer, then to make KDE apps, you need to use the
Qt library. To make gnome apps, you need GTK+ (GTK+GDK+glib).

If you're just a user, then your just run anything and see if
it works. If the app uses only levels 1 and 2 functionality, then
it should be fine, but any level 3 functionality probably won't work.
Like maybe a KDE applet won't work inside a gnome taskbar or something.

But if you're a developer, you'll just get the whole
development kit with everything there.
If you're a user, you'll soon find what works and what doesn't.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
