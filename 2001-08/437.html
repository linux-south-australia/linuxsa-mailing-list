&gt; &gt;1.	The cost of all that rubbish on my link.
&gt; &gt;	If I can stop it at the first packet or two,

&gt; &gt;2.	I hate seeing all that rubbish in my log files:
&gt; &gt;	tail -f /var/log/httpd/*.access.log
&gt; &gt;	My http log screen is 80-100% code red
&gt; &gt;	access at all times. Very ugly!
&gt; &gt;3.	Code red messes up the webalizer analysis.
&gt; &gt;	I'll have to filter all the log files

&gt; You could just change to use an ISP that blocks the probes for you at 
&gt; their expense, so you don't have to. What's your time worth? You 
&gt; could change ISP's, save money as a result, and spend all of your 
&gt; valuable time doing something valuable instead.

Simon,

The problem is that there are good HTTP packets in among the
bad HTTP packets, and I don't know which are bad until
they've already sent their request - which does the harm already.
Similarly, I wouldn't expect Bigpond to be able or willing to
put in sophisticated application-level blocking, nor would
I expect it to work correctly if they did.
It might not be free either.
(My time is worth between 0 and 150 A$ per hour, depending on
who's paying me, but that's neither here nor there....)

&gt; You could also upgrade to ISDN DoV or ADSL while you're at it, if 
&gt; you're tired of your 'little 33k link'.

I'm not at all tired of the little 33k link.
It protects me from bankruptcy. In the worst case of
the link getting filled, I still don't go broke.
If I get one of those modern-fangled ADSL links, I can go broke
in very few days, if I'm paying by the MByte at 20c/MByte 
or whatever. The 33k link is my "budget shaper"!!
And ISDN would double my costs, roughly.

If ADSL were more reliable, more functional (plenty of numerical
IP addresses and no conditions on me having servers etc.),
and if it had a sensible price cap, then I might spend a lot
of time converting over. Right now, 33k is realiable and cheap,
and I've addressed most of the "issues" after 2.5 years of it.

When ADSL goes beyond the roll-out phase and enters a more stable,
mature phase, I'll look at it again.

&gt; You have a choice of ISP's. Why on earth keep supporting the large, 
&gt; boring, unresponsive one that you use now?

Well, they're not at all as bad as people say.
They are very responsive to me. Having problems at 3 am,
I've always been able to contact an expert who can fix things
and look at logs etc. 
And as I said, they're cheap and reliable and stable.

I've heard that Telstra don't play fair with their competitors,
but from my point of view as a customer, they haven't been
at all bad.

Having spent so much time setting up my networks (total 10 real
hosts) so that I can work overseas for up to 6 weeks and know that
I don't have to fly back to fix it all, I don't want to go 
through all the same issues with another technology.

But the real killer issue is cost.
There's no price cap on anyone's ADSL as far as I know.
That means I can run up A$1000 or much more per day.
No one likes to sign a blank cheque that can be filled in
by a script kiddie with an army of DDoS zombies.

Install a budget shaper to my specifications - then
you'll get my business!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.


PS. I would only write an iptables-style netfilter module for
blocking IPs that send code red if I thought I would
learn some valuable skill from it, or I thought it would
be a valuable contribution to lots of other people.
I'm not going to do it if I only save A$50 per month from it.
There's too much collateral damage (blocking innocents) from
this approach anyway.
