Hi All,
	Just though you might be interested in a 10 minute run down of hard
disk layout. It could aid in removing viruses which have lodged
themselves in the MBR/ partitions boot sector.

Consider the following basic, one partition setup of a hard disk.

+-----------------+
| 1. MBR          |
+-----------------+
| 2.Free Space Gap|
+-----------------+
| 3. BootSectorP1 |
+-----------------+
| 4. Data...      |
+-----------------+

The master boot record (more correctly called the partition sector)
contains:
- An initial Startup program
- The Partition Table

The initial startup program tells the computer where to look next when
booting your computer. Lilo puts itself in this area and so does fdisk
/mbr or an installation of DOS/Windows. Hence if you reinstall windows
lilo dissapears.

The partition table indicates how the disk is divided into parts. Such
as Dos has 4GB, and linux has 6GB. It also indicates the 'Active'
partition. This is the part of the disk which should be consulted next
if the computer is not told to do something else by the inital startup
program.

The Free Space gap is a left over tragedy from days gone by. With LBA
(linear block addressing) it really isn't needed. However, it's kept
around for compatibility. (For the more technically minded, it's 62
sectors left in the cylinder so that partition 1's boot sector is
cylinder boundary aligned).

The boot sector of partition 1 is next (3 in the diagram). This area
contains some more information about how to start your computer. Each
partition has a boot sector. This area generally know how to start the
operating system. SYS C: will write information to this area. Lilo
installs information into it (it copies the contents of  /boot/boot.b to
it).

Finally you have the data for the operating system. This varies between
operating systems vastly. So I won't bother explaining it.

What about viruses?
--------------------
A virus can write itself into either the 'Initial startup program' area
of the MBR or into the boot sector of a partition. Booting the hard disk
will execute the virus. However, booting a floppy disk which reads the
boot sector of a partition may also execute the virus ( MSDOS 6.2+ does
this to determine if the filesystem is compressed - yes they still
exists). 

Booting a linux boot disk should not cause the virus to execute.

Clearing a particular area of the disk
---------------------------------------
If you can get to linux/bsd you can clear out any area of the disk using
the dd command. This can be really useful if a virus has lodged itself
in the master boot record or the boot sector of a partition.

I warn you though these commands can cause bad damage if used
incorrectly. Make sure you take a backup of everything before running
them. (That includes your partition table layout).

First You can backup the MBR:

dd if=/dev/hda of=/mtn/floppy/mbr_backup_datehere.dmp bs=512 count=1

and manually record your partition table information:

fdisk -l /dev/hda

Next you can clear the initial startup program 
(keeping the partition table intact)

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=446 count=1

Finally you can clear the boot sector of the first partition:

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda1 bs=446 count=1

Then it's time to reinstall them with the correct versions. Lilo will
rebuild the MBR & if selected the boot sector of a partition. FDISK /MBR
will reinstall the initial startup program in the MBR. SYS C: will
reinstall the boot sector for that dos partition.

Windows 2000/ME do weird things with SYS C: and so restoring thier boot
sector will be harder.

Cheers,
	Benjamin
