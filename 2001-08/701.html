&gt;&gt;This is controlled out of /etc/syslog.conf. Check that it has 
&gt;&gt;something like:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;mail.*
&gt;&gt;/var/log/maillog
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;or something like that. If it
&gt;&gt;has, then it is probable that ipop3d, or whatever, has not been 
&gt;&gt;compiled with syslog support.

&gt; A clue at last - thanks Richard. That line does appear in syslog.conf, 
&gt; so could you point me towards anything that will tell me
&gt; 
&gt; (1) how to find out if it really is ipop3d or something else I should 
&gt;     be looking at
&gt; (2) how to find out if it was compiled with syslog support
&gt; (3) if not, how to recompile it correctly?

Hi Ed,

Well, since you have that line in your /etc/syslog.conf file, then the 
problem sounds like ipop3d.

As I recall, you had a Cobalt Cube or some such box? With luck, they 
won't have stripped the executables, so, do something like:

     whereis ipop3d

which will tell you where ipop3d is, and then:

     strings /path/to/ipop3d | grep syslog

If syslog does not show up, it means your version was not compiled with 
syslog support, or that they have stripped the executable. You could 
also try:

     nm -D /path/to/ipop3d | grep syslog

to see if it shows up.

You might also want to tell us the version of ipop3d.

If you find ipop3d has not been compiled with syslog, then you will need 
a proper tool chain on the machine, or a cross compiler environment.

Life just gets harder ...
