Richard,

I'd just like to second that. Sometimes I get people mailing
me with questions like "did you ever solve that problem with
ssh and PAM on linuxSA". This from people who are not
subscribed to linuxSA but find the mails some 6 to 12 months
later! Most of the time we don't even know that the linuxSA
mails have been helpful. Just now and then, people send in
thanks.

So the linuxSA list is a worldwide resource! Of course, all
the flames go on permanent public record too. But all in all,
I'm sure it's a good thing that the list is publically archived.

Here's a sample.


==================================================
hi

i also had the problem with the "shared object not open" and as you, I
had no Idea what to do untill i found your thread on the mailing list.

i somehow even figured out how to use strace, as i am a damn newbee...
in my case, a whole bunch of crap was missing.

also httpd is searching in the kde directory for its libraries:




open("/opt/kde2/lib/i686/mmx/libm.so.6", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such
file or
directory)


pretty weird...

bye
stefan   
==================================================


I scanned all my own linux archives, and this guy has never
appeared on the linuxSA list.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
