&gt; Hey, I'm thinking of posting all my logs of dropped/rejected 
&gt; packets to telstra on CD, and saying "I shouldn't have to pay 
&gt; for this traffic".. Do you think I've got even the proverbial 
&gt; snowflake's chance of getting anywhere?

Nup..

I mean realistically all they do is provide the bandwidth, and the rest
is up to you, me, the world and Goliath.  Whoever Goliath is.  I think
the guy who wrote Code Red should be hunted down and killed for all the
money he's costing everyone, and then hunted down and congratulated for
the severe wave of embarassment that Microsoft should be suffering over
this.

Has anyone noticed how quiet Microsoft have been lately over this whole
'Code Red' issue?

So who DOES pay for it in the end?

Us - The ones who use the bandwidth
The Coder - for causing the headaches in the first place?
The Service Provider - Those who are giving us the opportunity to spend
money on redundant packets
Microsoft - The ones who leave holes in their software allowing such an
event to occur in the first place.. "Hey Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit
out of my hat.."



Hmm.


And for my next trick, I'll be suing every seventh website for loading
popups without my consent..  :)
