<H1>SAIX&lt;-&gt;SAARDnet peering [was: Re: FreeBSD mirror]</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
For the sake of correctness:

- Internode peered SAARDnet into SAIX, at its own considerable 
expense, via Agile fibre paths, and via Internode 7200 series Cisco 
routers, for quite some time.

- We did this because I was just trying to be helpful. There was (and 
isn't) any obvious way for that peering path to actually be paid for 
by either SAIX or SAARDnet - neither of which currently have a 
sufficient combination of money and inclination to fund the circuit 
concerned at this time (or it would be funded now!)

- The primary reason why we shut the peering link down, as I believe 
I said at the time, was that differences in the BGP routing 
configuration between AARNet2 and Internode and SAIX - i.e. 
differences in their respective 'world views', were causing us to be 
'piggy in the middle'.

To explain: Some routes (the straw that happened to break the camel's 
back was a route to a defence department network, but there were a 
number of others) were being advertised inconsistently by AARNet2 and 
SAIX members (and/or their respective upstreams) such that the 
difference between the two was pulling the inconsistently advertised 
traffic in to Internode's core router. That gave us exactly two 
choices in our own router core:

	- blackhole the routes (which we were doing) - causing 
various people to accuse us of screwing up the Internet (or at least 
the local version of it!)

	OR

	- carry the routes at our expense to the global Internet, in 
addition to carrying all of the carrier data link and routing 
overheads of the peering itself. (Yeah, right...)

This didn't give us a whole lot of choice.

So - right now, Internode is peered to SAIX, and Internode is peered 
to SAARDnet, both at Internode's expense (justifiable because in both 
cases Internode is a beneficiary).

However, Internode is not currently acting as a transit peer between 
the two networks, because that only causes us negative financial 
effects and causes us to become the butt end of vehment complaints 
from random networks in SA at random times, when we apparently (in 
their eyes) try to screw up their connectivity to the world by 
messing with their route advertisements.

For the record:

- There is no congestion issue in the path concerned. The reason for 
the deconfiguration of the BGP linkage is as noted above. That's the 
entire issue (that and a total lack of funding model for that peering 
to happen, meaning it was only ever a favour on my part, and a favour 
that we never had formal permission to implement from SAARDnet, 
either - the peering only happened due to the tacit decision by the 
parties concerned to 'just do it' for the greater good)

- There is no fibre capacity problem. Agile has end to end fibre 
paths in the routes concerned, today which we have offered to 
SAARDnet under reasonable conditions. Glen, I'll write to you 
directly to reiterate the issues there.

- gig-E into SAIX is, frankly, not all that useful, as SAIX doesn't 
drive more than 100 megabits of total traffic. In other words, 100 
megabits would be ample! However, Glen, if you would like to get a 
SAIX joining form from Kit Davis (<A HREF="mailto:execsec@saia.asn.au">execsec@saia.asn.au</A>), join SAIX, 
and request gig-E as your connection mechanism, SAIX will be pleased 
to make a gig-E port available for you.

Regards,
   Simon Hackett

&gt;The discussion about the number of hops to freebsd.unisa.edu.au (aka
&gt;sanctuary.magill.unisa.edu.au) began with a query as to why the routing
&gt;was going the long way round through Optus.
&gt;
&gt;Glen replied to me explaining the reasoning for cutting off the transit of
&gt;SAIX traffic through the Internode to SAARDNet link.  Read below.

&gt;&gt;  &gt; Great! Now if only saard.net was connected to SAIX somehow..
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  The link between Internode and SAARDNet no longer transits
&gt;&gt;  traffic from SAIX.  From what I recall, this was due to
&gt;&gt;  congestion.  I thank Internode for its support of both
&gt;&gt;  SAIX and SAARDNet.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  SAARDNet will connect into SAIX but there are a number
&gt;&gt;  of issues we need to work through before making that
&gt;&gt;  desire a reality.  The major two issues being fiber capacity
&gt;&gt;  between the SAARDNet core (in the Plaza Building of Adelaide
&gt;&gt;  University) and SAIX (possibly at 45 Pirie Street, I'm not
&gt;&gt;  sure if that has been finalised); and the ability of SAIX to
&gt;&gt;  terminate a gigabit ethernet feed.
