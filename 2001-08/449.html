Let's cut the crap.

Code Red, Melissa etc etc all attack various Microsoft applications or
operating systems. They have costed business at least millions of
dollars.

THEY HAVE NOT COSTED SO MUCH THAT BUSINESS EN BLOC IS SHIFTING OPERATING
SYSTEMS

THEY HAVE NOT COSTED ISP'S SUCH AS INTERNODE OR TELSTRA SO MUCH TIME IN
SUPPORT THAT THEY NO LONGER ALLOW IIS SERVERS TO FORM PART OF THEIR
NETWORK.

INTERNODE DOES NOT WORK WITH IIS INFECTED HOSTS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO
SAVE MONEY; THEY WANT TO SAVE MONEY AND THEY WANT THE IIS INFECTED HOSTS
(WHO PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW A THING) TO THINK THEY GOT GOOD SERVICE.

My main message is COPE. No more, or no less.

We'll live with Code Red or its ilk as long as companies such as
Microsof or even free software foundations such as Apache allow them to
exist. If people become used to Code Red then they may become
complacent. It may become part of Internet Living [tm].

Hmmm...

If that's the case, and if I were high up in Microsoft, then I would
make them used to it.

They've already gotten used to:

1) Having to reboot every time they change IP address
2) Having to reboot after installing a driver
3) Having to reboot after changing IP address

It would, under these criteria, be sensible to release a Code Red Virus.
Get the F**U****WITS used to having virii and be done with it.
