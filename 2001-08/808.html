Hi Alan,

&gt;&gt;It wouldn't surprise me a bit if the locals are already
using 1 GHz computers with 20 GByte drives and
a recent version of linux already.
&gt;&gt;

I could find out for you but it would take weeks. The Army guys are not 
allowed to use their mobiles and he doesn't have an email address &lt;G&gt;


On the subject of different countries and their level of technological 
sophistication.

1. At the other night's MS XP trade show the MS hack said that Win 95 
is still their biggest selling product although they are trying hard to 
shift their more recent products. Somebody must be buying their old OS.

2. In early 96 I worked as CAD operator for a small kitchen firm. They 
used a flash (AU$10k) computer controlled saw bench to cut the pieces 
for the cabinet work.  One time we had the engineer over from Italy to 
work on it. My mates came in with me to meet him and talk about the 
programming probs. One brought in his laptop with colour, CD and hi-fi 
sound. When he opened it up the guy from Italy was stunned with the 
size. When he started it up and the colour came up he was shocked. When 
the sound came up he almost disgraced himself. So my mate played a CD 
video on it and this guy almost forgot to breathe!

At that time he said that his country was not very computer literate. 
His company which was a very big player in the sales of these huge 
computer controlled saw benches was managed on a 386 PC. At that time 
to have a 286 in your home was a status symbol according to him.


I would hesitate to suggest that today would be a very different 
situation yet probably still someways behind us and the yanks.

cheers, Ian
