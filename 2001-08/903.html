They do? I'd say that depends largely on how much you spend on your
switch. Half decent switches have broadcast storm control, but it's only
at Layer 2. To handle broadcasts for a specific set of IP addresses is a
Layer3 activity, and if your switch does that it's practically a router
anyway.

Didn't UniSA have an extremely large switched-only network at one stage?
Bay Networks were using it  to promote what their switches could do.
Maybe someone from there has some experience at solving big broadcast
issues.
