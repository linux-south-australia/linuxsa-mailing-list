&gt; I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on Debian?
&gt; 
&gt; I have been using redhat and mandrake(dual boot win95) for about a year and 
&gt; have recently picked up a copy of Debian with the 2.4.3 kernel, the release 
&gt; is 2.2r2 (potato)

then you've got the 2.2.18pre21 kernel.
It's no problems installing that then upgrading the kernel to 2.4.x
afterwards (although I haven't done it yet).

I'm presently downloading the July woody (testing) iso to have a go
with that on a desktop machine (my server/gateway is potato and I
can't see the point of moving forward from potato yet on that since I
don't run X or sound and so on - except for security updates of course).

&gt; Being reasonably new to Linux any advice before I start would be much 
&gt; appreciated

go for it!  first time I installed debian, I went through it 2 or 3
times trying different install options etc to see what the results
would be.  "dselect" used in the install process is a bit of a pain,
don't select too much stuff is my advice, just the essentials, once
it's up and going you can easily "apt-get install &lt;anything else&gt;"
you want (do that before you change your /etc/apt/sources.list file
so you get it all off the cd rather than wasting time and bandwidth
downloading it all from the net - unless you've got a fast unlimited
connection of course).

Dave.
