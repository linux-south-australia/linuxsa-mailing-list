Heyas
Apache has it's .htaccess, which is good.
When netscape (or ie) tries to access a page protected by a .htaccess
file, the browser pops up a login window asking for a username and
password.
This is all well and good, but how do you get netscape or apache to
"logout" the user again? Because once you've viewed the page once, you
can keep on going back to it, or any others with the same .htaccess
username/password combo, and you'll never get asked again, until you
quit and reload netscape.

In keeping with the ideals of unix, instead of microsoft, I don't
believe that having to exit, and reload, is the right way to log out!

Does anyone know how to get netscape to "forget" it's logged in?
Does anyone know how to get apache to force netscape to relog?

It can be any method really - html, dynamic html by cgi, javascript,
dynamic html by SSI, PHP3, whatever...


I suspected it might have been a header pragma or something like it, but
I can't seem to find anything that's remotely close to a "login-expires"
or the like....
Does anyone have any ideas?

Toby
