Some blocks are quite boring.  Some are marginally interesting.  A very

No, seriously, Unix used to have very good documentation, which included
amongst other things an excellent discussion of file systems.  Then
along came GNU who decided that they didn't need to follow standards
and off they went and developed their own type of documentation (info
pages).  Personally I think GNU did a grave disservice to the world.
One thing which put Unix head and shoulder above every other operating
system was it's superior and CONSISTENT documentation.  Now it has
documenation which is still quite good, but who can find it?

Having got that rant out of the way -- but mind you: if you ever find
yourself tempted to write an info page slap yourself down.  Repeat after
me: Man pages, man pages, man pages.  In fact, write it out 100 times.
By hand.

The original Unix filesystem was composed of four sections: Boot blocks,
which contain the secondary stage bootstrap loader; a super block, which
I will describe in a minute; the i-node table, which contains i-nodes,
and i-nodes are the complete file except for the data; and data plus
indirect blocks.

I-nodes are, as I said, the complete file except for the data.  That
is, they describe who owns the file, when it was last accessed and
modified, what the permissions are for the file, and the list of blocks
which contain the data.  Side note: Unix files don't have names.  They
have (i-node) numbers.  Directories are files which contain a number of
filename, i-node number pairs; called links.

Data blocks contain the file data.  Since i-nodes are of fixed size,
obviously there is an upper limit to the number of data blocks which
can be listed in the inode.  When an inode can no longer contain the
list of data blocks, that list is moved to an indirect block, and the
i-node is converted to contain a list of indirect blocks.  When the
inode can no longer contain a list of indirect blocks, the list is moved
to a double-indirect block and the inode then contains a list of
double-indirect blocks.  I notice (/usr/include/linux/sysv_fs.h) that
"traditional" filesystems now allow triple-indirect blocks, which just
goes to show that even tradition is hard to keep up with.

The super block describes the size of the inode-table and the size of
the total file system.  It also contains a list of some recently freed
data blocks, which is used to quickly find a free block when you want
to allocate a new one.  Similarly there is a (partial) list of free
inodes.

I made the point that files don't have names, they have numbers, and
that directories provide a map between names and numbers.  So how do
you find the root of a filesystem?  The answer is that it is inode number
two.  Inode 1 contains a list of bad blocks on the disk.

One of the less desirable features of the traditional filesystem is that
it has only one superblock, and if you lose that you are really stuffed.
Look: You wouldn't even know where the inode table ended and the data
table started.  As a remedy to that, when the BSD Fast File System was
designed, it was given backup copies of the superblock.  So if you lost
the main superblock you could mount using one of the backup copies (but
you had to know where it was (but it's not to hard to find it.))

Now don't you agree that from a filesystem perspective, data blocks are
only marginally interesting, but that first block is just super?  ;-)
