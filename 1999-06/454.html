A friend of mine has something that controls radios operating in C for a
different brand of radio, which we were thinking of setting up to be
online somewhere. If someone wants to supply bandwidth and the PC side
of the hardware......
Alternatively, if anyone gets the javaradio server-end source code, we
would add in the alternative controlling code for you.

&gt; Re:  Swedish JavaRadio Source Code
&gt;         to be distributed for Free... with a
&gt;         "we'll implement it here" catch...
&gt; 
&gt; The author & webmaster of JavaRadio
&gt; (a scanner that you control & listen to
&gt; remotely; also has a chat window, so
&gt; you can share the controls with other
&gt; concurrent listeners around the world)
&gt; is still offering his source code FREE.
&gt; 
&gt; Like the JavaRadio itself (which re-
&gt; quires a show of Knowledge to use),
&gt; there are a few prerequisites:
&gt; 
&gt; To get the source, one must agree to
&gt; set up a JavaRadio in their neck of
&gt; the woods, so to speak.
&gt; 
&gt; To substantiate the agreement, one
&gt; must supply both the serial number
&gt; of a *specific* ICOM (0.5 - 1300 MHz
&gt; capable) radio -and- a fixed IP-
&gt; address for the intended web site
&gt; (not to mention an ISDN or faster
&gt; link for the JavaRadio-to-listeners
&gt; connection...)
&gt; 
&gt; It's a bit of an ask for the uninitiated
&gt; (or uninterested, for that matter) but
&gt; it is not without precedent (c.f. NIH's
&gt; amateur radio club's similar radios)
&gt; 
&gt; At the moment, just 10 people (of
&gt; perhaps 30+ applicants) have got
&gt; the OK to receive JavaRadio's
&gt; source...
&gt; 
&gt; I've got a request for relaxation of
&gt; the "only one model of ICOM radio"
&gt; condition, since it seems to me
&gt; that a JavaRadio with wider radio
&gt; handling capabilities would spread
&gt; wider than one that supports just
&gt; the author's choice of radio... but
&gt; I don't know how it will be received.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone here is interested in put-
&gt; ting Adelaide on the map/list of a
&gt; few places in the world where a Java-
&gt; Radio is located (i.e. so people any-
&gt; where the I'net reaches can hear
&gt; local broadcasts, comm's services,
&gt; etc. - just like we can now listen to
&gt; local Swedish transmissions of all
&gt; these types today, i.e.
&gt; 
&gt;   www.JavaRadio.com),
&gt; 
&gt; now's the time to make your interest
&gt; known (directly to the author/webmas-
&gt; ter of the JavaRadio site), by finding
&gt; such a radio's s/n and a fixed IP-adr
&gt; for your intended JavaRadio site.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, somebody in the Hills - hey
&gt; Geoffrey, are you listening? - would
&gt; have a good location for a JavaRadio.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, the system includes a Linux
&gt; server, under the hood...
&gt; 
&gt; In fairness, I must report that also in
&gt; the system is a Win 95 box, for some
&gt; reason... (subject to modification, I
&gt; trust...); to preclude any matters of
&gt; conscience (vis a vis buying Win95)
&gt; I am willing to contribute a genuine
&gt; Win95 CD-ROM (& bona fide license)
&gt; to the project, i.e. as a member of any
&gt; team that can pull it off.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, I would expect to have shared
&gt; access to the source code, which I would
&gt; like to help get modified to work with some
&gt; *other* model(s) of radio than the one for
&gt; which it was originally designed...
&gt; 
&gt; Any takers?
&gt; 
&gt; (Alternatively, you can mount a similar
&gt; engineering effort of your own, e.g. for
&gt; /with the support of a local radio club,
&gt; be it shortwave/scanner listeners or
&gt; amateur...)
&gt; 
&gt; Details of the JavaRadio, its design,
&gt; and the source code offer are all to be
&gt; found at the above URL.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know what you come up with.
