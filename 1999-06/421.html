&gt;ANNOUNCEMENT
&gt;
&gt;I have decided to write a "lilo" look-alike running under MS-DOS. I have
&gt;done this because of a personal need. I've had so many difficulties getting
&gt;my Windows Box and Linux Box (the same machine) to behave themselves, that
&gt;I have given up even attempting to get "lilo" to work whilst Windows95 is
&gt;on the system.

Ummmm, why bother?  I have no problems dual booting a Win9x machine which
has Win95 on the first partition and Linux on the second.  Indeed, this has
worked for years.  I also have Win95 and WinNT 4.0 Server and Workstation
all on the one machine along with Linux.

And in any case, if you want something that will boot Linux from DOS, what
is wrong with loadlin.exe.  It seems to be on the TurboLinux CDs, and I
would imagine it is on the RH CDs as well.

Save your programming talent for a problem that really needs solving.

&gt;"lloylo" will attempt to redress this problem by imitating as far as it can
&gt;the look, feel and configuration files used by "lilo", however, running
&gt;under MS-DOS.
&gt;
&gt;This pre-release version is a very BASIC version of what "lloylo" will look
&gt;like. It has no features, everything is hardwired into the C code and you
&gt;need to have a file called "linux.bat" in the same directory as the
&gt;"lloylo.exe" file.
&gt;
&gt;I am using Borland C++ 4.52 to develop "lloylo" and licencing it under GNU
&gt;Copyleft. I have included the actual distribution as a WINDOWS zip (it's
&gt;not actually intended to be used under the Linux environment) and also a
&gt;basic text  README file I have developed for it.
