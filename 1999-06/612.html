Subject: Motion of opposition to internet cencorship legislation


&gt; I was speaking to a couple of people from LinuxSA .. in recent weeks.

So, why haven't you made your view better known...
- e.g. by contributing in the Linux SA debate -
i.e. BEFORE the GST went through (yesterday)...?

&gt; I was very dissappointed to find out I'd missed a legal summary of the
&gt; internet legislation.


&gt; I have been taking an active role in the debate over the
&gt; government's internet censorship legislation, talking to members, in
&gt; the debate, etc. I was particularly concerned to be told that may
&gt; people believe that such legislation is the Liberal Party line.

Most that I have spoken to believe that it was
just one of the negotiating tactics used to get
the GST through...

&gt; I hate this situation: young liberals & student liberals have for years
&gt; voiced their opposition to exactly the sort of legislation as is being
&gt; introduced.

Apparently "behind closed doors" (like the all-male Adelaide Club?)
since I have read nothing about it, here on Linux SA or in the press.

&gt; I've been doing a bit of follow up to try to put as much pressure
&gt; on the parliamentary party as possible. Last night we put up a
&gt; motion at yl state council as follows:
&gt;
&gt;"The Young Liberal Movement (SA Division) believes:
&gt;
&gt;1. The Federal Governemnts should revoke its recently introduced
&gt;Internet Censorship legislation as it is unworkable and will deter
&gt;investment in the telecommunications sector.


I have no doubts that - now that the GST is well on its way -
we will see the silly Internet censorship legislation die...

Just imagine how much more progress we might have
made (e.g. on positive e-commerce legislation) had
there been a Bill of Rights -or- a Freedom of Speech
clause at the right point in our legislative framework.

I suppose that Young Lib hopefuls will soon suggest
that they have brought the Old (Powerful) Lib's back
to their senses - i.e. now that the GST is on its way -
and will take responsibility for "saving" Australia from
the embarassment & cost of implementing the very
legislation that has cost this country & its short-sighted
legislators much respect - both within its borders and
out in the larger world.

Sorry, son, I can't buy into you "Look what we say, now"
platform.  While people who were born and raised in a
land where politicians need not take on-board findings
of the country's scientific community (e.g. CSIRO's re-
porting that the chances of content-blocking work'g = nil),

a lot of us have discovered - through the very Internet
that you would have censored - that OTHER governments
in the world actually listen to their scientists & technologists
when they render professional opinions (in areas of their
expertise), thereby saving time, effort and money (which
here has been expended on a senseless, dividing debate)
to enable it to be applied (over there...) to the development
of better e-commerce infrastructure & legislation.

In short, your claim to fame is falling on deaf ears, sonny.

&gt;2. That legislation forcing Internet Service Providers to make web
&gt;content filtering software available to new customers within the price
&gt;of their service is a worthwhile means of addressing parent concerns
&gt;about Internet content"


"forcing ISPs" in a "free country"?!?

I see no reason why the application of telecommunications infrastruc-
ture (known as the Internet) should warrant any special efforts towards
"forcing" businesses (i.e. ISPs) to do anything...

That is, if you do not "force" Telstra-type businesses to provide tech-
nologies to address concerns about abusive telephone calls to people
in their own homes (I refer, here, to the entire range: from unsolicited
telemarketing to the even more offensive verbal abuse calls), why
select ISPs for presurising?

There was a time - before Caller-ID came to Australia - that we had
the technology to help protect individuals in their homes from such
abusive uses of telephone infrastucture... but it was "forbidden"...

No, sonny, come back for some applause after you have taken on-
board what real people (not politicians) feel is important.

We WANT the lower prices that e-commerce & the increased compe-
tition that Internet helps to provide, we DON'T want censorship (espe-
cially when it's purpose was to help get *unrelated* tax legislation
through the door), we DON'T want unsolicited telemarketed in our
homes during family quality time, and we WANT to decide for our-
selves what we will read/view/hear/etc. from any & all sources...

oh, another thing... we WANT to shop in well-stocked, competi-
tively priced supermarkets when WE will, NOT when you (and/or
some motly collection of understocked, overpriced deli owners
may want us to be able to shop)...

Even as I hold SA's Labor movement responsible for very poor
value-for-money Gaming Machine legislation (that lead to the
allocation of many millions of dollars to "improve" pokie clubs,
rather than to help help bring technology companies to SA)...

so do I hold the present gov't responsible for our loss-of-face
- internationally - as well as a turning of a significant portion of
the Australian people AGAINST technologies - e.g. the Internet
as they fear the evil aspects of it without tasting the positive
ones, among which are many that can improve business
and our quality of Life - even in country areas.

Forget it, sonny... Take wisdom from where ever it may come
- even the Internet.. and take your pleas for applause & new
members with you as you walk away from Linux SA.

&gt; It was carried.


Too bad you didn't seek the opinions of some of the technolo-
gists here on Linux SA earlier...  ;)

&gt; I know that many of you would disagree with the second half of the
&gt; motion. However, it seems clear that the governemnt are determined to
&gt; do something to give parents help controling their children's access to
&gt; the internet,

In that case, do something to bring costs of living down, giving parents
the chance to spend more time with their kids, rather than the need to
take on a second job, outside the home.

Develop "cottage industries" and the kinds of "telecommuting jobs"
that AFAIK only government workers have access to at present...

(In Sweden, of course, new parents may share up to a year away
from work - with 90% of the "lost" income still paid to them - so as to
help build a "bond" between parent(s) and the new child; the new
child is visited by a community nurse often during this period,
and health issues are dealt with... including relationship-building
between parents and children, to some degree... encouraging
good parenting from the start, so that parents will invest the time
it may require to guide kids - even when they surf the 'net... helps
far more than "forcing ISPs to provide" another set of handcuffs.

Perhaps your repressive mentality is responsible for Australia's
high suicide rate... another world record, I understand...)

Think about it:  If a parent is able to be productive while in the home
(e.g. during their kids' earlier years), they can be there to guide
their kids' development in many areas... they don't have to buy some
software "hand-cuffs" made for "the general case"

Instead, they can decide for themselves what's right & what's not.

Contrast with:  School uniforms = one style fits all...

Maybe this type of "blinker-mentality" is what's got Australians
afraid of the uniqueness of experience & ideas that can come
from the Internet... with a little help from the gov't, recently...

In a place where kids may feel socially isolated if they're not
"up to date" with the fictional happenings on some TV series,
the thought of 30 kids (in the same class) having 30 or 60
*different* ideas passing through their minds must frighten
even the hobgoblins of little minds that dress their kids alike
...at the demand of the State (and sometimes even private
schools) in this country.

But I would venture to say that those kids who've "survived"
the independent thought experiences from those unique
ideas (e.g. from the Internet, or in their parents' business,
for that matter) have greater chances of making positive &
creative contributions to their society later, e.g. when apply-
ing their minds to problems in science and/or engineering...

 "The Internet - Dream it, Think it, Build it - but don't Fear it"

&gt; and if that is the case, then point 2 above would be
&gt; arguably the best way to ensure that that is the case.

"Forcing" a minority of ISPs - small businesses?!?
Why not pick on somebody your own size...

&gt; I don't think

I'm tend to agree with this proposition...  ;)

&gt; that anybody would argue that that outcome is not far better
&gt; than the legislation continuing in its present form and
&gt; killing off the industry.

I have argued so (see above), in favor of attrbuting to parents
a sense of responsibility for their children's upbringing -and-
the capability to decide for themselves what is appropriate
for their children, given the opportunity and some guidance.

It is truly insulting to parents that the only outcome you can
come up with - as better than futile attempts at content-
blocking - is the equally untenable one of software handcuffs.

Why not encourage a good child-rearing culture, for a
change... so that kids won't "need" to experiment with
bombs, illegal drugs, porn, etc. and - more to the point -
their parents won't "need" Net Nanny or the like.

Instead of vilifying technologies, so that large companies
can monopolize it, encourage Australians to learn how
to use them for positive purposes.

&gt; Please resist any temptation to respond with flaming because
&gt; of the second part and recognise what we're trying to do.


Why?  Would you "force" your reader to respond as you wish?
Is this your idea of open and complete political debate?!?

We are quite free to express ourselves in any way that we wish,
as you are, sonny.

And... we DO recognise what you're trying to do (see above...)

&gt; I hope to put the motion up at the SA Liberal Party State Council in a
&gt; few weeks time.


Let's hope you receive and consider some feedback
(like the above) before you do... and maybe take your
motion back for a second reading.
