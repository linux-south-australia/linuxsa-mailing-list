Thanks for the latest update to the Media Items for Boral Energy.

Up to date, all of the documents that have been received have come in to
Boral Energy as industry standard ASCII documents, which can easily be
managed automatically by the database, and placed on the Corporate Intranet.

Unfortunately, the last couple of transmissions have been sent as proprietry
encoded documents, (MS-Word) which then require additional effort from our
staff to manually remove the proprietry extensions from the data, and
convert back to an industry standard ASCII format. 

We would ask that you please return to sending the documents as industry
standard ASCII documents. 

You should be able to re-configure your e-mail environment to overcome this
problem quite easily. If you have recently upgraded your e-mail
infrastructure in the belief that it conforms to industry standards out of
the box, then you may have been mislead by your e-mail vendor. If this is
the case, then I would recommend that let them know.

Thank you
Steve O'Connor
