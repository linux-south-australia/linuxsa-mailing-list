&gt; Has anyone used VNC?
&gt; What is it performance like? Especially low bandwidth, (modem), links.
&gt; On what platforms have people used it

I have used VNC - it came with My SuSE-5.3 distro ..... its OK, its
cross-platform, even has a java bizzo for using VNC via netscape etc!
Its OK, bit quicker than pcanywhere but I only have 2 windoze boxes & no
real reason to want to run VNC on them on my LAN.

VNC is fine over my LAN ... it is NOT fine over the internet.....maybe
with 56K+++ at both ends?????
Apart from VNC, I dont know of any other apps that allows you to "run"
windoze on a linux box...but then why would you want to ???  :))
I do however (unfortunately) sometimes have to access remote linux boxes
from a windows machine.. ..... a sad state of affairs :)

My method of doing stuff remotely on a linux box is to run an xterm from
the remote box on the  windows desktop (or linux Xwindows)
You need XWINPRO or one of its predecessors xwin411 xwin406 etc for
win95/98.  Under linux its really very simple...xwinpro needs a little bit
of configuring first up but is basically quite simple to setup.

On the linux box you are on (or windoze using xwinpro) you set xhost + (or
xhost (remote ipnumber)) which allows a connection to your Xserver by the
remote linux box. You then telnet in  to the remote box & type     xterm
-display [remote.ip.num.ber:0]   eg/ xterm -display 123.123.123.123:0 &
Once the xterm window appears on the box in front of you , you can kill
the telnet session.

It gives you total control over the remote box as if you were sitting
there & allows you to access some of the more useful X apps as well.
One thing worth noting though... unless you start multiple xterms you will
need to judiciously apply an "&"  for some apps. I find this method far
more useful than just running a telnet or ssh (of ftp sftp or scp)
session.  This method seems a hell of a lot quicker than VNC or PCANYWHERE
imho too.
Many  Xwindows apps have the -display option .....  eg/ netscape -display
123.123.123.123:0  (oh, if you dont know, the :0 refers
to the X Server)

Maybe everybody knows abt this method, but it seemed relevant to this
thread so thought I would stick my 2 cents worth in :))

Cheers, Phil
