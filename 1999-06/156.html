I had a similar dilemma about the Spirit card's video capture
resolution when I bought one for my Masters project (thought I'd
better mention the project to avoid creating the impression that I
have spare time to watch TV).

I called Spirit to get the answer, which is simply that the Win95
software that comes with the card can only handle 320x240.

Under Linux using the bttv driver (which comes with the 2.2.x kernel),
it can capture up to 768x576 on a PAL signal.  The bt848 chip has
various support for pixel filtering, decimation and interpolation to
provide other resolutions.

Having said that, for most purposes a resolution of 384x288 is quite a
good compromise.  The higher resolutions of course use more bandwidth
on the PCI bus, so can slow the system down.  If grabbing sequences to
disk, the frame rate that you can get will depend on your disk and
memory speed and the software, as well as PCI bandwidth.  Using the
"streamer" utility that comes with xawtv, I've been capturing about 4
frames per second synchronously at the highest resolution without
dropping any frames; with bttvgrab, the throughput is faster but the
frames are not necessarily uniformly spaced.

  Mike&gt; HI Read the documentation for a video display/capture program
  Mike&gt; like xawtv. The capture resolution has nothing to do with
  Mike&gt; Linux, and all to do with the capture card, and the software
  Mike&gt; abilities.

  Mike&gt; I have not tried to work this out.

  Mike&gt; The card uses the brooktree BT484 capture chip, which is
  Mike&gt; supported by Linux.  You will get better mileage from kernel
  Mike&gt; 2.2.x

  &gt;&gt; Win 95 capture resolution is 320x240 but max. cap. res'n is
  &gt;&gt; 768x576 (which hints of NTSC-format video)
  &gt;&gt; 
  &gt;&gt; What is Linux's vid.cap res'n?
  &gt;&gt; 
  &gt;&gt; (Their support page does not mention Linux)
