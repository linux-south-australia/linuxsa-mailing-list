Hi Michael,

I'm using Mandrake (direct copy of redhat 6.0 with a few goodies from mandrake
proper boot menu etc.)

&gt; I have X running on a pentium233 with a diamond 64 4mb vram video card.
&gt; It does run very well, and it is a 968 chip. (you can check it out by
&gt; reading the numbers on the chip off the card)

This sounds very similar to my setup, and yes you are correct with the 968
chip.

&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I'm running it with a Mitsubishi Diamond plus 17 inch
&gt; diamondtron monitor at 1280x1024 and it is pretty good. the sync could
&gt; be a bit higher (60hz) but that is all I can get at this resolution I
&gt; think.

I'm running an acer76ie 17" Monitor with a max. of 60hz (according to label on
back)

&gt; I could send you my setup, but you need to know that if you ran it and

I do not have the skill or knowledge make this decision so I'll pass on the
setup offer.

&gt; it overdrove your monitor, it could destroy the monitor completely.

Not a pretty thought :-)

&gt;
&gt; Let me know if you want it. What sort of monitor do you have?
&gt;
&gt; Getting X to run can be one of those things that you just have to go
&gt; through a bit of pain to get there. I've set it up a couple of times
&gt; for friends, and I think they tend to not notice things that are clues
&gt; to problems. In the early days, I used to run it in -probeonly mode
&gt; which would show all the messages without actually running it. You
&gt; should be able to do this by typing /etc/X11/X -probeonly  on a RedHat
&gt; system

&gt;
&gt; Spend a bit of time in the man pages:  man XFree86  will get you
&gt; started.

Im a proverbial (book) man-worm now although I think the worms have made there
way into my brain ;-)

I have taken all the advice on board and have used the 'text' only option the
'setup' option the 'xf86config' and the xconfigurator and have managed to get
the problem to be acknowledged by the setup program.  It now says there is a
problem with the X configuration and I can go back and make changes.  This is
better than the blank screen with no way out.
It was as if the monitor just switched off, I could not bring up any other
screen alt ctr backspace F1 etc. did nothing.  But I could shut it down safely
with ctr alt del and get back in after the boot.

At this time I'm stuck and think I need the help of a Jedi ahh emm I mean a
Linux guru.  Ill keep trying until the next Linux users group meeting and
bring my comp along and ask for some help then

&gt;
&gt; Good luck!

Thanks for the help Michael and all others who replied


Steve

PS. Is it my imagination?... there appears to be some evidence (strictly
anecdotal of course) that extended use of the Linux command prompt corresponds
with a reduction of humour cells in the brain. (grin with tongue in cheek)

PPS Would it make any difference because I am running from hdb6 ( I have
multiple drives partitions)
