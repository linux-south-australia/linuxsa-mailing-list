HOW TO GET LLOYLO

I apologise for this. I realise I forgot to tell people how to get
"lloylo". I have attempted to post the WinZip to be sent through the
linuxsa sender, however, after about 8 hours of waiting for it to appear I
assume that the resender at linuxsa ism't willing to.

To get a copy simply email me directly at

  <A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@senet.com.au">lloy0076@senet.com.au</A>

And I will include a WinZip with
  1) the source code (lloylo.c)
  2) the GNU CopyLeft Agreement (copyleft.txt)
  3) the README file (README.txt)

Having read the fine detail of the GNU copyleft I need to make sure that
all users of the product know where to obtain a copy of it and I felt the
easiest way would simply be to include verbatim as a separate text file.

I also believe I need to include enough source files for you to be able to
compile it. You will need a respectable DOS or Windows C compiler to
compile this. I have used the following C libraries:
  1) stdio.h
  3) string.h
  4) stdlib.h
  5) bios.j

I consider these as standard in any standar C distribution for DOS or
Windows hence I have NOT included these header files. Because of the
multitudes of C compilers in the Windows/DOS world around I have not
included a project file.

My hunch is that, provided you know how to use a command line C compiler
and a command line linker to link the resulting .obj code, it should
compile without an IDE such as Borland's or Microsoft VC.

Because of the nature of Windows, it's not NORMAL for a compiler to be
included with s Windows distribution. However I would argue that unless you
were interested as a developer you wouldn't need the source code. If you
are a developer for Windows or DOS you would already have a C commpiler
capable of making an executable file from my source.

Therefore I believe I have also met this requirement.

DAVID
