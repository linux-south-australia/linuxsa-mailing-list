Hi,

I'm trying to get gnat to work on my computer, but i'm really not having
much luck :(

I tried getting the binary rpms from the libc6 and libc5 sections of the
redhat-contrib ftp site (well, the aarnet mirror), however neither worked
properly. Firstly, I figured that libc6 is newer, so I'd try that. my test
program compiled, but when I tried to run it, it did a segmentation fault.
I then tried the libc5 version, but I couldn't even get it to compile (I
followed the instructions in /usr/doc/gnat-whatever/readme.redhat). I
decided maybe it's got something to do with newer software (i'm running a
RedHat linux 6.0 machine), so I got the source.

I was hoping the source rpm would have the source tree ready to run "make
all; make install", but unfortunatly (for me) it doesn't seem so. I really
like the libc6 version of gnat since it had gcc renamed to gnatgcc, so I
can still use newer versions of gcc, so I thought i'd try that, however, I
have no idea how to apply the patch. I admit I havn't looked in detail
through the readme's in the various different packages (there was a gcc
source tree and a gnat source tree as well as about 5 patches), but I
started reading the top and it was very long and not "run this command,
then this", so I got lost :(

can anyone suggest what to do (get newer rpms from somewhere, how to apply
patches and compile gcc with ada support, anything else)?

thanks,
Andy
