&gt; Hi, anyone using this card?  I have got it working after a fashion but
&gt; very quietly.  I suspect there is a default volume setting or it needs
&gt; to be set up in a specific way.  I believe the sound server has to be
&gt; set up.  The available information for this card
&gt; is limited.   The card will actual work if linux is booted from ms
&gt; windows

I use the card, an OEM SB PCI 64. I like it, 

No problems at all.  Well maybe a bit of static at peak volume, but nothing
serious.

One thing I did note is that the manual (IIRC) indicates that the headphone socket
is to be used for line out, meaning that you should have powered speakers for
output.

Other than that I haven't played with it too much.

&gt; first because the drivers remain resident although it only works for the
&gt; cd player.  The relevent modules are compiled for this kernel (2.2.10)
&gt; and install when insmod or modprobe are used.  I may need clearer
&gt; instructions for the sound modules.  This system is Debian so it may not
&gt; have certain files that redhat may such as /dev/sndstat.  

Have a play with the ALSA, I use that as my sound card driver.  

They don't have sequencer support, but I am sure that will come later :).

Regards,

Matt
