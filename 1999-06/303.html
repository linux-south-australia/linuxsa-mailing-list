C'mon people... if it's so good, I say:
license it (or re-invent it)

(Paying a price shows that you value
what you're paying for.)

Isn't it enough that there is so much free
and/or GPL'd source, documentation, etc
around to play with...?

Would you force the artist to contribute
their time (or a company to give-away
the work of an artist that they may have
paid for)?

Why not go back to creating new tech-
nologies, for a change... or even learn-
ing to use them proficiently even... OK?

I am reminded of APANA's "closed"
apana.* newsgroups (some years ago
if not also today)... in which - after con-
suming all the world's free Internet-based
info, source code, images, sounds,
movies, et al. - that "public access"
organisation took steps to effectively
close *its* own newsgroups (in which
members of apana share their contri-
butions) to the non-apana world around it...
both local and overseas alike...

Surely, a commercial enterprise is
to be given license to protect some
of its intellectual property if it so de-
sires (of course, this goes also for
an individual).

After all, the CD Image was appar-
ently *not* released under GPL...
