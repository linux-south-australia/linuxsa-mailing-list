&gt; Try Norton's Disk Doctor.  The latest version will understand FAT32
&gt; partitions and happily repair as necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; But first - make sure, using linux's fdisk, check that the partition type
&gt; for your "Drive D" is set to the FAT32 - I think it's "b", from memory.
&gt; fdisk will tell you.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, NDD is not free software.  Can anyone suggest any
&gt; alternatives?  I actually had a very similar problem after Windows 2000
&gt; chewed a disk it wasn't supposed to touch (I dare anyone to say "told you
&gt; so") - a combination of linux's fdisk, the Norton Disk Doctor, DOS's fdisk
&gt; (the "fdisk /mbr" command) and DOS's "sys" command all worked to fix it.
&gt; 
&gt; Scarey stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; Beware of Windows.  It's not for those accustomed to a hardy, trustworthy
&gt; system.

&gt; &gt; I have 1.1 GB as a Fat32 primary and 1.1 GB as an extended partition
&gt; &gt; ( a allocate 1.2 GB as a logical drive ).Currently I have 800 Mb
&gt; &gt; as a Linux
&gt; &gt; native partition .I had free space of 100Mb at both primary and extended
&gt; &gt; partition.Before I try to resize my partition I already have defrag my
&gt; &gt; harddisk.
&gt; &gt; The problem occur when I tried to use the cfdisk
&gt; &gt; to upgrade my linux partition size from 800Mb to 1GB ( get 100Mb
&gt; &gt; each from
&gt; &gt; primary and extended partition).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I delete my linux native partition ( as a primary ) and recreate the
&gt; &gt; partition as 1 GB and I choose it as Primary.I works.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But when I boot my Window 95.The D drive is lost? It is detected as
&gt; &gt; unformatted !
&gt; &gt; How to recover the Data  ?
