OOPS.... Sorry If I gave the impression that I was having a go at the other Phil... I wasnt ... the lack of a smiley

after RTFM just reminded me of a somewhat terse posting I saw recently from someone else which,unlike Phil's posting,

did NOT provide the answer or give an indication of further reading......... which in turn reminded me why

this is probably the first mailing list I have bothered contributing to.... I dislike Flamers intensely :) which in turn

prompted me to babble :)) (Something I can do quite well - i have a very good selection of soap boxes ;)))

I once asked a stupid (but important to me) question on a linux-related & very highly  populated newsgroup -

I needed to know something & couldnt figure it out  so in desperation I asked ppl I thought would know

I receieved 67 responses back to the mailing list & 13 direct - all except 2 were insulting, demeaning & basically told me

that whilst they knew the answer, I was obviously too stupid to deserve to be told :))  The other 2 ppl gave me the info

I wanted and apologised **in advance** for the flames they said they knew I would get!! The letters RTFM were an integral

part of nearly all the replies :)) Only the 2 "nice" ppl did what Phil did & gave me an answer & further places to look.

Oh, btw Phil, I totally agree with giving ppl enuff information to enable them to know where to look - that was all I wanted

in my post to THAT newsgroup back then :))

I suppose I was just giving a subtle indication of my stance on flaming & flamers :))

To Phil Nitschke, my abject apologies - I didnt think you were flmaing anybody, it just brought back memories by

association:)

For those that are interested, I have had quite a number of requests for an explanation of what the file /proc/kcore is :)

I wont say how many but enough to restore my faith in human nature :)

Hint #1:  Find out how much RAM you have in your Computer

("free" wont give you the exact answer btw so add a few Megs to that answer)

Hint #2: Now type cd /proc & then type  ls -la kcore

Hint #3: Now add 2+2 and figure out why I couldnt "rm" my ram :)))

Cheers, PHIL

PS: I am really curious "why" people on this newsgroup run/are interested in  LINUX

Is it possible for someone to set up a "web-page" on linuSA where users can register & fill out a brief form so

that we know more abt each other & our reasons for being in this group - similar to the international register of

linux users (the address of which I have totally lost). Maybe linuxSA already has such a service but I am unaware of it.

I, for example, am Sysop of an Amateur Radio TCPIP Internet Wormhole/Gateway Packet Radio Network (running LINUX of course)

(Packet Radio is data over radio using AX25 protocols (AX25 is Amateur Radio version of the Commercial X25 protocol)

- tcpip over radio is basically internet protocols piggybacked on AX25 - it allows Amateur Radio operators to use

internet protocls/service via Radio rather than landlines & to access other amateur radio 0perators around the world

using similar systems - we can also access certain internet sites which fall within the provisions of our licences.

Access to our network by non-licenced Internetters is blocked in a big way (lots of access deny statements in config files!)

I also "remotely babysit" my ISP's linux boxes & in return receive certain "gratuities" (like free 2nd phone line & a

permanent free dialup etc etc)

I taught myself Linux (scary isnt it :)) which means I know everything I needed/wanted to know &  absolutely nothing

abt stuff I have not yet needed or wanted to know ;)) BUT I learn very fast!

So, now you all know abt me :))

PPS: have received 3 more requests for explanation of kcore while I have been writing this :))
