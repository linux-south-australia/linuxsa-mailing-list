Hi, thanks for the reply, it's been really useful, however.... 

&gt; SRRM's are normal fairly eaay to recompile.
&gt; 
&gt; You normally just do: rpm --rebuild rpmname.src.rpm
&gt; Then to install it: rpm -U /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/*.rpm
&gt; (I always use upgrade)

ok, so now I know rpm is really cool. I tried doing this with several gnat
sources, but none compiled :(
3.10p1 compiled for about 30 minutes (i think it actually compiled
everything) but then it started copying files to various places and the
rpm --rebuild quit after there were a No such file or directory error with
cp.
3.10p3 had some strange error - it seems there's a syntax problem
somewhere so after about 30 minutes of compiling on my computer, the error
appears and stuffs up everything :(
3.11p1 doesn't even start compiling, becuase when it runs configure, the
compiler it looks for is gnatgcc, but that's what i'm trying to compile!

&gt; Many gnat rpm's exist.
&gt; Go to <A HREF="http://filewatcher.com">http://filewatcher.com</A>
&gt; In the search box put: gnat*.rpm

I did this (actually, i searched for gnat*86.rpm) and there were a few
different versions of gnat. After the sources wouldn't compile, I got the
binaries (hence the search above) but none of those would work either.
3.09p? - the filesize was 1k, so I didn't bother downloading it
3.10p1 I have this on a CD from Adelaide Uni, but the gnat1 executable was
in teh wrong directory, but when i moved it to the bin directory, i was
told:
"Ada.Text_Io" is not a predefined library unit
3.10p2 this contained a gnatlib.so file or two that was put in /lib, so
this was totally useless
3.10p3 programs compile, but seg fault.

although there was a 3.11 source, there were no binaries :(
I pay for my downloads so I probably won't try downloading the 3.10p1
binaries for a while, if I do ever bother trying it, but I guess it'll be
the same as the version on the CD.

I know that the windows version of gnat works, btu I don't want to boot
into windows (or load vmware) just for that. Can anyone help me? :)

thanks,
Andy
