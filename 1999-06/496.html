<PRE>
Tellurian Pty Ltd is looking for staff to fill vacancies in it's
technical department.  Duties would mostly be focussed towards
"commercial programming," although we have many projects and
opportunities in other areas.  Core skills needed include C and
Unix.  Other skills that would be well regarded include C++, Java,
Tuxedo, Oracle, Windows, MFC, MacOS, MacApp, TCP/IP, Holos, and
CGI.

People with good communication and interpersonal skills are highly
encouraged to apply.  If you like writing documentation, this would
be an advantage.  Hours of work are very flexible, and I might just
add that we have a well stocked espresso machine in the kitchen.
Remuneration depends on you.  Location is Prospect, just north of
Adelaide.

Don't be put off if you lack formal qualifications or extensive
experience:  We can use a junior just as much as a senior.

Please respond by email to <A HREF="mailto:admin@tellurian.com.au">admin@tellurian.com.au</A>, or by post to
  Attention: David Newall
  Tellurian Pty Ltd
  272 Prospect Road
  Prospect  SA  5082
