&gt; In keeping with the ideals of unix, instead of microsoft, I don't
&gt; believe that having to exit, and reload, is the right way to log out!

It isn't necessary.  Apparently the 5.x series of the browsers will have
a bit more intelligence when it comes to password management.  But until
then it is a bit hacky.

Have a look at...
	<A HREF="http://www.ticons.com.au/~mtippett/test.phtml">http://www.ticons.com.au/~mtippett/test.phtml</A>

*Brace for the LinuxSA-effect*

The test tags are protected by authentication.
The none is an unprotected page...
The clear does the magic :).

The code that does it is at 
	<A HREF="http://www.ticons.com.au/~mtippett/test.html">http://www.ticons.com.au/~mtippett/test.html</A>

&gt; It can be any method really - html, dynamic html by cgi, javascript,
&gt; dynamic html by SSI, PHP3, whatever...

I don't think you will be able to this with raw apache basic auth, you need
to be able to work with the headers.

The trick is that you have to trick the browser in thinking that the
username/password for a given realm is invalid and consequently when it
gets challanged for that realm will request if from the user.

Have a peek at the page, the code should be fairly simple to follow, and 
from there if anyone has any questions have mail the list and I will go in
a touch more deeply.

It is not perfect, but works well for Netscape and IE.

Regards,

Matt
