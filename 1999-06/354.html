Hi Nick
Although I'm not one of them, many of those who respond to this list are
ISP's or work for ISP's, as are a some of those posing the questions.
Their experience helps particularily with the eseoteric coms issues, telstra
quirks etc.

In the crazy but wonderful "cooperation amongst compeditors" way the opensource
systems thrive, this is often giving a leg up to their compeditors. I think it
would stretch things too far though to expect them to help build a new
compeditor. Better to keep this a "sharing" forum in my view.

Also, on a more mundane basis I don't think its needed. The margins for ISP's
are thin & is a choice of several linux competent ISP's in SA. And for those
who want permanent connections and just routing (because they can provide all
the services themseves) the backbone providers will provide direct connections
to their routers at wholesale rates, even via modem.

regards
Adrian

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; Has LinuxSA thought about providing Internet services to all those
&gt; interested in using Linux?
&gt; We have around us so many bright people that helped us in the long run
&gt; with setting up the Linux box, how to connect to the Net and so on...,
&gt; why not have an Internet Service Provider especially for Linux users?
&gt; You never know, we might be able to be the best net surfers ever! How
&gt; about that?
&gt; Best wishes,
&gt; 
&gt; Nick.
