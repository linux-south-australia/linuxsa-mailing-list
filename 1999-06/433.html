&gt; 1. Both business units should remain autonomous and will eventually have

Security from each other?  Or from the net?

Linux 2.2 with Rusty's IP chains is a neat solution if you have a
policy that is "deny every except for the things I know about".
It does allow denial of service attacks on the server, but
with an ISDN link I wouldn't get too fussed.

99% of Internet access is DNS, web and e-mail.  Since you have a tiny
link, run a DNS forwarder (named) and web proxy (squid) on your
server.  Both of these make solving the security problem simpler.

You can get ETSI ISDN cards for Linux and synchronous serial cards
(if you are using an ISDN terminal adapter such as the JTEC J1200).


&gt; 2. Both business units want to be able to use some kind of group aware
&gt; scheduling software, so each unit can see what the other is doing and book
&gt; meetings etc.

Netscape, Corel, Microsoft and Lotus.  All but Microsoft have been making
noises about Linux support for their entire product range, but I'm not clear
what is on the ground yet.

It's worth a trawl through the web sites.  For an SME, a web-based
Perl-scripted program wouldn't have any performance issues and
could be a lot cheaper.  It's probably out there...

If you do have to spend money, then read "First Things First" or s similar
time-management book.  I've found the Netscape product to be useful
for booking shared resources (such as cars and rooms) but useless (and even
counterproductive) for time management.

&gt; 3. Internal and external email is mandatory - but two domain names are
&gt; required.

sendmail and cyrus IMAP looks the best combo for e-mail.

Sendmail will present multiple domain names with no problems.

IMAP allows you to store all e-mail on the server and have
people access it through a good range of e-mail clients:
Communicator, Outlook, etc.


Since you are establishing a LAN, also set up a standard
PC configuration.  Store data files on the server -- the
Samba package lets UNIX servers appear as Windows file and
print servers.  Just setting the "documents" directory
in MS Office to point to the server is a good start.
Storing data file on the server doesn't have a huge performance
impact, but does ensure that people's work is backed-up.

Keep a backup tape offsite.  The simplest way to do this is
a buddy arrangement with another sysadm. Every week you exchange
locked money boxes that contain last week's backup tapes and put
them into your safe.  Some banks offer safety deposit boxes
that have no access fee.

Do use Samba for printing.  If you are shopping for printers,
buy a PostScript-capable laser printer with a UTP ethernet
interface and support for the UNIX LPD protocol.  Try and
get a duplex (double-sided) printer that isn't too fussy
about paper gloss and quality.  Start by looking at the
HP LaserJet series.  Put the recycling bin next to the
printer.

Move any modems onto the server.  This usually fixes a
big security hole.

Use the web to share company-wide documentation such as
leave forms, logos, etc.  The Apache server is a good web
server.  For each service, put a small "how to" document
on the web with screen dumps specific to your company.
Call these "procedures" and you get ISO9002 points :-)

Both Samba and Apache can also be used to share the server
CD-ROM drive.  I've found this to be very useful when
companies give out CD-ROMs at presentations, as you can
put it on the server for the rest of the week rather
than have it circulate through in-trays.


As for performance, you are best off with a single quick
CPU, lots of memory (say 0.25GB) and multiple hard disks
to seperate out disk access patterns (/home, /var, swap
on different disks).  Backup is best done with a seperate
SCSI card and a SCSI tape drive.  Ultra-SCSI2 drives are
very nice, but very expensive.  Looking for a motherboard
with multiple EIDE controllers is usually more price-effective.
There should be free drive bays and memory slots.


For documentation, buy the O'Reilly "sendmail" and
"bind and dns" books.  One of the LinuxSA members
is a co-author of "Teach yourself Samba in 24 hours"
which is good.


As for networking.  Use category 5 UTP and ethernet.  Use a good
but cheap 10/100 switch like a HP or Intel.  Depending
on pricing, if you can't get 10/100 on every port, then
get one of the switches that have 24 10baseT ports and
two 100baseTX ports and plug the server into one of the
100 ports.  Intel and SMC make good cards.  3Com do too,
but avoid their early cards.  Special "server" cards
don't work under Linux.  Try an use the same model card
in every PC.

Set all ports on all devices to "autonegotiate" speed and
duplex.  Allocate IP addresses out of 10.10.0.0, and assign
them to PCs using dhcpd on the server.  Your average PC
will then work `out-of-the-box', which makes life simpler
for notebook users.


None of the above doesn't mean that there aren't other
ways.  I've just seen the above done successfully with
the least number of issues.  For example, Linux 2.2
does do SMP, but it's newish and has occassional issues.
Similarly with alternatives to sendmail.


All the above is a surprising amount of work.  But what you
are really doing if shifting work from the PC users to
the system administrator, and thus gaining economies of scale.
There are occassionally cultural issues with attempting to
gain the economies of scale -- not everyone likes being told
that their PC will be set up in this particular way, or that
we aren't going to use their particularly favoured software
package.  When merging two organisations these issues are more
sensitive.

Finally, try and make computing (and work too!) a fun experience.
To my mind, that is really the core of the Microsoft/Linux
cultural divide.

Best of luck,
glen
