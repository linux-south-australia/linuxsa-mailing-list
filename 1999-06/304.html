For those who need a giggle, someone sent this to me, and
well.. you'll just have to get to the bottom to find the Linux
content.  :-) 


The seven dwarves go to the Vatican.....   The Pope answers the door, and 
asks, "Dopey, my son, what can I do for you?"  

Dopey asks, "Excuse me, Your Excellency, but are there any dwarf nuns
in Rome?" The Pope smiles and answers, "No Dopey, there are no dwarf
nuns in Rome." In the background, the Pope can see a few  of the
dwarves giggling.  Dopey then asks, "Your Holiness, are there any
dwarf nuns  in Italy?"  The Pope looks at Dopey and answers, "No
Dopey, there are no dwarf nuns in Italy."  At this answer, half the
other dwarves start laughing openly. Dopey continues, "Mr. Pope, are
there any dwarf nuns in all of Europe?"  The Pope, getting tired of
these questions, answers, "Dopey, there are No dwarf nuns in all of  
Europe."

This time, all of the dwarves are rolling on the ground laughing.
Dopey raises up and says, "Pope!  Are there ANY dwarf nuns in ALL the
world?"  The Pope, totally frustrated by now, says, "Dopey, there are
no dwarf nuns ANYWHERE in the world!"  With this answer,  the other
dwarves start laughing, jumping up and down, and chanting, "Dopey
screwed a penguin!  Dopey screwed a penguin!"
