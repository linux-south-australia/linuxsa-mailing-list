  Daniel&gt; How do you kill zombies?

  me&gt; Grenades are usually the best, but if you've got plenty of
  me&gt; rockets, use your rocket-launcher.
  me&gt; 
  me&gt; Another answer: you don't kill them; they're already effectively
  me&gt; dead.  RTFM.  ---edited bits out to save space :)) ------ --
  me&gt; Phil.  Women are more enigmatic than linux :-)

  PP&gt; A few comments:

  PP&gt; 1: ZOMBIES Based on years of trying to kill zombies on my
  PP&gt; various linux boxes, I can tell you that the reason they are
  PP&gt; called zombies is because they are already dead

  &lt;&lt;SNIP ...&gt;&gt;

  PP&gt; 4: RTFM I agree totally with the RTFM concept....however are you
  PP&gt; familiar with EWANO & PUTAV 

  &lt;&lt; SNIP ... &gt;&gt;

It is interesting how people interpret written text.  I posted a
response which 
	1/. Began with humour
	2/. Answered the question
	3/. Provided a reading list of further information on the subject
	4/. Suggested the reader Read The Fine Manuals I had listed
	5/. Ended in humour (albeit politically incorrect) (.signature line)

... and the post is followed by a subtle reminder about being _patient_
(after half my response was culled to "save space").

Perhaps I should have written:
      "RTFM ;-))))))))"
or:
      "Please RTFM."
?
Apart from that, how could my response have been improved?

Regardless, I believe it is better to show _how_ to find the
information than to provide all of it, which only encourages laziness.

Q : What do you get if you cross Salvador Dali with a box of Museli?

A:  A jolly nutritious breakfast surreal!
    (available at your local Dali-catesen too!)
