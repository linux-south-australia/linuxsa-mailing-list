Hi,

&gt; I am a new user to Linux and I would like some guidance on installing red 
&gt; hat 5.2 and know problems I might come across, and would like to know were 
&gt; to get software drivers to run a zip drive and a musket 4200 scanner for 
&gt; linux.

As to the former, potentially anything, common probs, I'd recommend
reading the first few pages of the RedHat manual. If you downloaded from
the net, then visit the RedHat site and browse the Installing FAQ. These
will cover common problems. The things I've found I needed were more in
the planning:

Know your hardware: get a system report from Win 95 if necessary. 3 Button
serial mice are a common problem. Know your partition tables, plan where
linux is going to go.

Think about partiton structure:You must have a swap file, how large ?
think about usage of the computer. Linux's memory stamp isn't as large as
MS's. Do you want a separate /home partiton, as separate /usr. There are
advantages to having, and not having.

You'll need to know video and monitor details for XConfigurator, soundcard
details for sndconfig, and read the 3 Button Mouse minihowto for getting 3
button mouse support going in X.

For Zip drives, read the Zip howto. You shouldn't need drivers. I can't
say for your scanner. Check the RedHat site for Hardware compatability.
It'll possibly tell you what to use.

cya
