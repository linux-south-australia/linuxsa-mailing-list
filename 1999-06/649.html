I believe I had a hand in starting this thread. My original
message was a general complaint about the Government who
were putting in generally unworkbable legislation regarding
the Internet. I also mentioned that I am successfully using
a multi-platofrm tool called "JunkBusters" to eradicate a
number of banner ads.

You might try to look at:

This program and a topic is Linux related - realise you are
more than likely connected to the InterNet now - it is
simply an affirmation that for my particular needs this
program has enhanced my connection to the InterNet and
incidentally, enhanced the speed at which I can view various
pages.

That others have taken this topic far beyond its orginal
tbread is a credit to our community and to the people who
read this list. This list is most certainly about Linux and
unfortunately this particular piece of legislation is most
certainly about all people especially those who do use the
Internet.
