Hi!

&gt; Hi, i'm just wondering is there anyplace that compares FreeBSD against

Lots. Wars erupt on Slashdot every couple of dozen articles as soon as a
zealot from one camp pipes up with 'But FreeBSD's more stable', or 'Linux's
faster'. :) I can't think of anywhere with an unbiased comparison, and it'd be
very hard to compare one OS to another - it basically depends on what you wish
to use it for.

&gt; I have heard that FreeBSD was better as a firewall and was wondering if
&gt; i could have a look at some comparisons.
&gt; I know that KDE and gnome both work on Linux do they work on FreeBSD,
&gt; also what about package management?

FreeBSD uses the ports system (<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/">http://www.freebsd.org/ports/</A>), which is a sort
of source-only package management system. It's cool once you've had a play
with it, though perhaps not so easy to keep up to date as Debian Linux's, or
Red Hat's.

Basically, they're both excellent OSs. Linux is Linux, with its industry
support, large developer base and high profile, and FreeBSD has a very
talented core group and BSD's stability and excellent networking behind it. I
use both at home and at work, and don't have any problems with either.
Both do most things, it's down to personal preference. I believe Mark Newton's
thinking of doing a talk on BSD sometime soon, he'd probably be able to tell
you anything you needed to know.
