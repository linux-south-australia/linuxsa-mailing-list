Hi all,

If you don't like RTFM style answers then turn away now!

In a normal console the mouse is accessed via gpm.
vodka [4] [2:18pm] [~] -&gt; man gpm

The only file that stores mouse details for gpm is;
vodka [5] [2:19pm] [~] -&gt; more /etc/sysconfig/mouse 
MOUSETYPE="ps/2"
XEMU3=yes

This file is referred to for initialising gpm at startup.
vodka [6] [2:19pm] [~] -&gt; more /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/S85gpm



Under X the details for controlling the mouse are stored in
/etc/X11/XF86Config
vodka [7] [2:20pm] [~] -&gt; more /etc/X11/XF86Config 

&lt;cut&gt;
# **********************************************************************

In order to understand how to setup this section by hand... RTFM
vodka [8] [2:22pm] [~] -&gt; man XF86Config

&lt;cut&gt;
       The  Pointer section is used to specify the pointer device
       and parameters.  The entries available  for  this  section
       are:

       Protocol "protocol-type"
               specifies  the  pointer device protocol type.  The
               protocol types available are:

                    Auto
                    BusMouse
                    GlidePoint
                    GlidePointPS/2
                    IntelliMouse
                    IMPS/2
                    Logitech
                    Microsoft
                    MMHitTab
                    MMSeries
                    Mouseman
                    MouseManPlusPS/2
                    MouseSystems
                    NetMousePS/2
                    NetScrollPS/2
                    OSMouse
                    PS/2
                    SysMouse
                    ThinkingMouse
                    ThinkingMousePS/2
                    Xqueue

               One should specify BusMouse for the  Logitech  bus
               mouse  and  bus  or InPort mice from Microsoft and
               ATI.  The Logitech  protocol  is  for  old  serial
               mouse  models  from Logitech.  Many newer Logitech
               serial mice use either the Microsoft  or  MouseMan
               protocol.   Xqueue  should be specified here if it
               was used in the Keyboard section.  OSMouse  refers
               to  the  event-driver mouse interface available on
               SCO's SVR3, and the mouse interface  provided  for
               OS/2.  This may optionally be followed by a number
               specifying the number of buttons  the  mouse  has.
               SysMouse   refers  to  the  system  mouse  device,
               /dev/sysmouse, in FreeBSD.
               The PS/2 and other XXXXPS/2 protocol types are for
               PS/2  mice.  PS/2 should always work with any PS/2
               mouse regardless of the model of the  PS/2  mouse.
               The  other  XXXXPS/2 protocol types may or may not
               be supported by your OS.

               The rest of the  protocol  types  are  for  serial
               mice.  If your serial mouse is of a relatively new
               model, you may specify Auto,  then  the  X  server
               will  try  to  select an appropriate protocol type
               automatically.  The Auto protocol  type  may  also
               work for the PS/2 and bus mice on some OSs.

       Device "pointer-dev"
               specifies  the  device  the server should open for
               pointer input (eg, /dev/tty00 or  /dev/mouse).   A
               device  should  not  be  specified  when using the
               Xqueue or OSMouse protocols.

       Port "pointer-dev"
               is an alternate form of the Device entry.

       BaudRate rate
               sets the baudrate of the serial mouse to rate. For
               mice  that  allow  dynamic speed adjustments (like
               older Logitechs) the baudrate is  changed  in  the
               mouse.   Otherwise  the  rate is simply set on the
               computer's side to allow  mice  with  non-standard
               rates  (the  standard  rate  is 1200).  For 99% of
               mice you should not set  this  to  anything  other
               than the default (1200).

       Buttons N
               This  option tells the X server the number of but-
               tons on the mouse.  Currently there is no reliable
               way  to  automatically  detect the correct number.
               This option is the only means for the X server  to
               obtain it.  The default value is three.  Note that
               if you intend to assign Z axis movement to  button
               events  using  the  ZAxisMapping option below, you
               need to take account of those buttons into N  too.

       Emulate3Buttons
               enables  the  emulation  of the third mouse button
               for mice which only  have  two  physical  buttons.
               The third button is emulated by pressing both but-
               tons simultaneously.

       Emulate3Timeout timeout
               sets the time (in milliseconds)  that  the  server
               waits  before deciding if two buttons were pressed
               ``simultaneously''  when  3  button  emulation  is
               enabled.  The default timeout is 50ms.

       ChordMiddle
               handles mice which send left+right events when the
               middle button is used (like some Logitech Mouseman
               mice).

       SampleRate rate
               sets  the number of motion/button-events the mouse
               sends per second.  This  is  currently  only  sup-
               ported for some Logitech mice.

       Resolution count
               sets  the  resolution  of the device in counts per
               inch.  This is not always  supported  by  all  the
               mice.

       ClearDTR
               This option clears the DTR line on the serial port
               used by the mouse.  This option is only valid  for
               a  mouse  using  the  MouseSystems protocol.  Some
               dual-protocol mice require DTR to  be  cleared  to
               operate  in  MouseSystems mode.  Note, in versions
               of XFree86 prior to 2.1, this option also  cleared
               the  RTS  line.   A  separate  ClearRTS option has
               since been added for mice which require this.

       ClearRTS
               This option clears the RTS line on the serial port
               used  by the mouse.  This option is only valid for
               a mouse using  the  MouseSystems  protocol.   Some
               dual-protocol  mice require both DTR and RTS to be
               cleared to operate in MouseSystems mode.  Both the
               ClearDTR  and  ClearRTS options should be used for
               such mice.
