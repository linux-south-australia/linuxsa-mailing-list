Yeah, if you want.  Linuxsa isn't necessarily for that purpose though.
There are companies that provide that level of service, and you usually have
to pay for them.  We're not support consultants, we're just cluey linux
users that like to chat about things.

For the record, Linux (UNIX in general..) has got to be the easiest OS to
configure remotely..  you virtually never have to sit in front of the box.
It's fantastic :)  PcAnywhere and VNC etc etc are cool, but are much more
resource-intensive - try playing with a windows machine running VNC over a
33.6 modem connection.  Not fun at all.  Whereas telnet works fine :)

My 2c :)

&gt; &gt;we can't read your computer configuration remotely.
&gt;
&gt; As I read the above, I was reminded of pcAnywhere
&gt; (which, of course, is for DOS & Windows) and other
&gt; remote control software
&gt;
&gt; People who can help other users (usually for $'s) can
&gt; look at the problem computer's configuration & fiddle
&gt; with things, in order to solve the problem(s)...
&gt;
&gt; Surely, it is possible for people to connect Linux boxes
&gt; in a similar manner.  Since Linux config'ns are mostly in
&gt; easily editable text files, I would think that it should be
&gt; easier and potentially quicker to both assess current
&gt; configuration and make any needed adjustment to it.
&gt;
&gt; Now, there may well be some risk (to the party being
&gt; helped) to let "just anyone" who says they can help
&gt; do this directly... but it would still be good practice
&gt; for the helper (e.g. towards becoming a great "on-
&gt; line help-desk" expert for Linux systems... another
&gt; great "cottage industry" provided by computers... ;)
