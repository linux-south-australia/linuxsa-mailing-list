Just a quick question in case someone else has had it and fixed it..
The PC I'm working on here has a soundcard on the motherboard, which is
an ESS1868 clone. This card is not plug-n-play, but is set in the BIOS.
The card is supported as an SB-compatible by the soundblaster (sb.o)
sound module.
I find that after the card has been playing mp3s for a long time
continously, when you eventually stop, it won't play again until you
remove the sound modules and reinstall them, which has the annoying
effect of resetting the mixer volume to maximum, which on headphones is
painful!

The problem is not in x11amp. The not-playing problem seems like an IRQ
problem, because you get the first halfsecond of whatever you're
playing, and you don't get an error message.

Any ideas?
Next time it happens i'll watch the /proc/interrupts and see if the
soundcard one is still incrementing when it's (not) playing.

Toby
