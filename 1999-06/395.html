Episode VII: David Strikes Back.

For your information, I can "work it out for myself", and am extremely
"..likely to understand the safety issues."

In spite of the beautifully condescending recommedation you gave David,
people did respond. To those who responded positively in the 1 line of
text it took to answer the question, Thankyou. To those who decided to
respond negatively, Thankyou also, for it takes all sorts to make this
world truely interesting to live in.

Really, why dont you take your head out of your arse David, and start
behaiving in a civilised manner.

And, by the way. You really do make some shocking assumptions some
times, and you know what they say about that: "Never assume. It makes an
'ass' out of 'u' and 'me'"

Good day.

&gt; 
&gt; If you can't work it out for yourself then you are unlikely to
&gt; understand the safety issues.  I dare say few people would answer,
&gt; "how do I undo the safety catch on a gun, and save me the ``that's
&gt; not safe'' advice."  For much the same reason I recommend nobody
&gt; answers your question.  But trust me, read a bit and you'll find
&gt; the answer.
