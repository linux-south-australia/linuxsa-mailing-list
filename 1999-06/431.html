List,

A company I work for is looking towards expansion. I am fairly knowledgeable
in Windows NT and still very much a novice in Linux. In the past we have had
one small network of 15 machines running Win95 and one server running NT4S.
We have a subsidary company that has had its own network (Lantastic!). The
two business units now want to merge.

We have several objectives in mind:

1. Both business units should remain autonomous and will eventually have
their own domain names through a shared ISDN link. Security is paramount.
2. Both business units want to be able to use some kind of group aware
scheduling software, so each unit can see what the other is doing and book
meetings etc.
3. Internal and external email is mandatory - but two domain names are
required.

Since I only really know Windows NT, I could produce a semi-solution to this
(maybe a full solution with some extra work - two domain names for external
email is fine, but using the same system for internal mail I have yet to
solve), but I am reluctant to propose an NT solution due to cost and,
basically, I am anti M$ now :)

Any feedback as to how I may tackle this from a Linux point of view would be
appreciated. I know this is a big ask, and probably even bigger if I request
no negative comments, like read the manuals (I would love to read every
HOWTO, man page etc, but I just do not have time). I am happy to investigate
documentation when I know what I am looking for, but at this stage with
Linux that would be everything, so some fine tuning from those with wider
knowledge would be appreciated.

Many thanks in advance.

Mike
