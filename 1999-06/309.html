Why Win95 is Better than Linux
  Feb 15th, 23:09:40

As posted to comp.os.linux.advocacy, by Jon Hamkins.

It's Funny... Laugh. -lt ed

Because all operating systems are written by programmers, I assume that any
operating system is much smarter than me. Thus, any good operating system
should try to outsmart me by restricting my options at every turn. Linux, like
all versions of Unix, is lousy at restricting my options because at the command
line virtually any operation can be performed with ease. (For example, 'rm -rf
/win' could delete an entire mounted directory, with no popup window warnings
whatsoever.)

I'm proud to say that there is no such danger in 95/NT. Windows pop up when I
want to make a change, and then more pop up to ask if I'm sure I want the
change. Thankfully, Windows 95/NT operating systems look after my computer's
well-being by occassionally switching configuration settings from the way I
want them to what the OS programmers think they might probably ought to be.
Boy, I'm just impressed with how smart they are. Once I learned to live with
whatever the default settings are on any new hardware I install, I can't say
the number of hours I have saved.

I use that spare time to reboot my Windows machine multiple times a day.
Technical support personnel recommend that I do it regularly-- kind of like
brushing my teeth. To help remind me of this necessity, windows pop up to
tell me to reboot whenever I make a configuration change. By now my machine
is minty fresh, I figure.

There is no such useful rebooting in a Linux system. It is as reliable as the
sunrise, with uptimes in weeks and months. Virtually no configuration change
requires a reboot, to boot. Imagine all that plaque in the computer. Gross!

In 95/NT I am prevented from making dangerous fundamental configuration changes
unless I use a special "registry editor". I have found it so useful to have
this separate editor that I hope in future versions they go all the way and
supply a separate editor for each file on the disk -- in that way windows could
pop up at every keystroke to warn me that changing any line in the file I am
editing could cause the system to not run properly.

If this were only the case, people would finally learn that it is best to just
stick with the mouse and they would be freed of the need to constantly move
their hands back to the keyboard. (If one stops to think about it, the mouse
is a much better device to use than the keyboard. Ever hear of someone getting
carpal tunnel syndrome from a mouse? No. It's comfortable and ergonomic. Like
morse code devices. That's how long distance communication started, after
all.)

Linux, by contrast, requires no special editor to change configuration files.
The fact that there is no "registry" in Linux allows the abomination of using
any text editor whatsoever to do the configuration. Can you believe that
configuration files are usually stored clear text? Talk about dangerous!

I am also happy to report that I have experienced no truth to the rumor that
Windows disks become corrupt after improper shutdowns. Indeed, I have been
forced to improperly shutdown the machine innumerable times after it locks up,
and I have no apparent problems to report regarding the disk. No such claim can
be made for Linux. They say something about lack of data points. Excuses are
all I ever seem to hear from the Linux crowd.

By sheer size alone, Windows 95/NT beats Linux hands down. It is so much
bigger, it is obvious that it is better. Why would you want a small OS with the
large disks and RAM sizes we have these days? For this reason alone, I heartily
recommend Windows as a way to maximize resource utilization. Your CPU and disk
will constantly be pegged to the limit, the way god intended. The Linux kernel
and drivers accounts for only about 750KB. Why, even the Microsoft Win16
subsystem uses more space than that.

It is no surprise that Windows costs $270 on the retail market and Linux
doesn't cost anything. People know what they want, and they want Windows.
Because Linux is free, that means it's basically worthless. The same goes for
all the development tools, remotable GUIs, and applications, which all cost
money for windows (i.e., are worth something) and free for Linux (worthless!).

Installing software is very easy in Windows. I usually slip in CDs without even
reading instructions or warnings, and just double click on whatever window pops
up. There is no need to read anything or touch the keyboard. (Did I mention
that I hate that thing?) Well, OK, I have learned the hard way the the machine
locks up if I don't take the time to close all other applications.

Linux, by contrast, requires typing on the keyboard to get anything to install
at all. And you always have to know the NAME of program you want to install.
For example, in Redhat, you have to type 'rpm -ivh ' to install the program and
documentation. Linux needs to get with the '90s!

Windows follows the DOS convention of putting \r\n at the end of every line of
a text file. While this is only a mild concern because of the relative rarity
of text files on Windows machines these days-- thank god-- it helps to
differentiate between the text files and the other files. Sadly, Linux makes no
distinction between text and other files.

If I legitemately purchase Windows 95/NT, I can call Microsoft customer support
to get help with my problems. After a short hold time of an hour or so, they
always help me. Ever since I told them that I was dual booting to Linux, they
were able to flag my account and now each time I call even the entry level
support personnel I am connected to say that Linux is the source of my
problems. Everyone seems to agree that Linux is no good. The more I listen, the
more I'm impressed with the knowledge of the support staff there.

By contrast, in Linux, all I have is stockpiles of resources and documentation
that I would actually have to read in order to understand. Sure, I could obtain
Linux support from a commercial organization, but they would probably just tell
me I have to use a text editor to fix up my system.

In the end, I have no need for that old computer donkey Unix. I don't need to
run big Unix tasks, afterall. I refuse to become one of those a bug-eyed
computer users, that's for sure. As soon as I can keep Windows from crashing
for long enough, I'm going to delete my Linux partition, i.e., the equivalent
of moving it to the recycle bin, saying that I'm sure, emptying the recycle
bin, and again saying that I'm sure.

Hope you enjoyed this. :) Comments or suggestions for improvement of this text
are welcome.
