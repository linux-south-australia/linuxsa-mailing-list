 &gt; &gt; I was speaking to a couple of people from LinuxSA .. in recent weeks.
 &gt; 
 &gt; So, why haven't you made your view better known...
 &gt; - e.g. by contributing in the Linux SA debate -
 &gt; i.e. BEFORE the GST went through (yesterday)...?

The fact that a view has not been made known to you does not mean
it hasn't been made known at all.

 &gt; &gt;"The Young Liberal Movement (SA Division) believes:
 &gt; &gt;1. The Federal Governemnts should revoke its recently introduced
 &gt; &gt;Internet Censorship legislation as it is unworkable and will deter
 &gt; &gt;investment in the telecommunications sector.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I have no doubts that - now that the GST is well on its way -
 &gt; we will see the silly Internet censorship legislation die...

You really think so?  I doubt it.  The Libs have invested too much
PR, spin and determination for that to happen.  I think you'll find
that Howard and Alston actually want to see it through, and that they
may have been almost as determined even if the GST hadn't been an 
issue (Remember that it hasn't been one for weeks now, ever since 
negotiations with the dems started).

We shall see.

 &gt; Just imagine how much more progress we might have
 &gt; made (e.g. on positive e-commerce legislation) had
 &gt; there been a Bill of Rights -or- a Freedom of Speech
 &gt; clause at the right point in our legislative framework.

Great - But we don't have one, and it's unlikely that we'll see
one in my lifetime.  Deal with it.

 &gt; &gt;2. That legislation forcing Internet Service Providers to make web
 &gt; &gt;content filtering software available to new customers within the price
 &gt; &gt;of their service is a worthwhile means of addressing parent concerns
 &gt; &gt;about Internet content"
 &gt; 
 &gt; "forcing ISPs" in a "free country"?!?

In case you haven't noticed, Australia isn't a free country.  Senator
Tierney mentioned that we have an environment of "total censorship"
in other media and that the 'net shouldn't be any different.

I don't like it any more than you do, but you really have to start
accepting that you're not in the US anymore.

 &gt; I see no reason why the application of telecommunications infrastruc-
 &gt; ture (known as the Internet) should warrant any special efforts towards
 &gt; "forcing" businesses (i.e. ISPs) to do anything...

Agreed, but using the idea that this is a free country to justify that
view is uselessly wrong.

 &gt; &gt; It was carried.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Too bad you didn't seek the opinions of some of the technolo-
 &gt; gists here on Linux SA earlier...  ;)

What, you mean technologists like you?

   [ four screens of irrelevence deleted ]

 &gt; &gt; Please resist any temptation to respond with flaming because
 &gt; &gt; of the second part and recognise what we're trying to do.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Why?  Would you "force" your reader to respond as you wish?
 &gt; Is this your idea of open and complete political debate?!?

It was a request for courtesy, one which you have apparently denied.
Think about that for a while, if you will.
