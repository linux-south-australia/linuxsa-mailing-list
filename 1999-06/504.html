Hi Steve,

At 16:06 24/06/99 +0930, you wrote:

&gt;That much I knew.
&gt;Can anybody give me some idea of the level of risk, or the amount of effort
&gt;required to gain entry to a protected directory on a well administered
&gt;server?
&gt;

There is only one major security risk I can think to make noise about and
that is keeping the ".htpasswd" and ".htgroup" files WITHIN the DocumentRoot
of the webserver makes them potentially readable (yep they're ASCII ;-)
to the world. This gives them a nice list of correct usernames and a
corresponding list of crypted passwords (which will take no time to crack
as they can be compared against each other's encoding/crypting).
Simple answer is to keep them at the same level as cgi-bin
eg:	/usr/local/apache/htdocs/
	/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/
	/usr/local/apache/secure/.htpasswd  

The .htaccess files need absolute paths anyway so it is no biggie
if the files be outside of the whole Apache dir structure.
I've never tried to break them before but I've been using .htaccess auth
methods for 2~3 years and some of the points I've noted are:

- Any auth method other than "Basic" will give you firewall headaches 
(eg 'Digest' or 'MD5')

- MS Browser suck because they can save the passwords that are used for
later (when someone else might be on the machine)

- As mentioned earlier, they only request auth once per realm, per browser
session (ie: must close browser to forget)

*GOOD THING
- You can alternatively create your .htpasswd file as a DBM file (eg: "users")
and utilise the .htaccess tag "DBMAuthFile" instead of "AuthFile".
This will require two things
1) DBM support compiled into the httpd daemon (check your Apache
"Configure" script)
2) Using the "dbmmanage" script (instead of "htpasswd") to create and change
the "users" dbm file.
The main advantage of this method is that it is somewhat harder for some user
to utilise the dbmmanage script, (particularly if you perm it to root
and/or hide
it in a root-only path), than it is for them to hack the .htpasswd or .htgroup
files with any old ASCII util/editor. There are other advantage is combining 
this with some management CGIs that can add/remove accounts from the users
file 
(via Perl's DBM access functions) saves on clunky commandline htpasswd inputs.

Caveats:
I have yet had no joy whatsoever with getting this DBMAuthFile support to
work under Linux (I did have once upon a time on someone else's Solaris box,
so I do know it works). I just can't get Apache to use the same DBM libs as
Perl and "dbmmanage" are using. However, if I was able to set this task
as a priority project, I would be pretty confident of getting it going.
I am also running entirely Slackware systems here too, so that might
have been dogging me a bit in the libs dept.

Hope all this helps,
Regards
-Daniel
