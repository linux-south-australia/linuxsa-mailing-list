&gt; This is absolutely true -- But I'd strongly suggest avoiding email;

Correct.  Discussions I've had with MPs suggest that writing a
letter to your MP is the best thing you can do as an average
citizen to bring attention to an issue.

In order of effectivess, actions are:

 1. a personalised letter
 2. a personalised fax (put in the pile with the letters by
    most offices)
 3. a telephone call
 4. a form fax
 5. a form letter
 6. e-mail

Obviously, it is too late to send a letter, so heat up that
fax machine.

If you are going to relocate out of Australia because of the
legilsation, then *please* fax Jim Lloyd MP.  He will be giving
a speech during the debate opposing the Bill, but being in the
Liberal Party, will be voting for it along party lines.  He
has said "...not heard of anyone threatening to leave Australia
or move their business overseas if the Act [sic] was passed".

Obviously some people and business *is* going to move, so if
you are a reputable business that is going to shift then please
set the MP straight.

Thanks,
Glen
