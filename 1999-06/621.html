&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a RH6.0 system going, and I would like to use it to connect to the
&gt; internet via my Hayes External modem.  I will be using the serial port to
&gt; connect the modem to the computer.
&gt; 
&gt; What I was wondering is what software I should use to get the modem
&gt; connecting to the internet.  I know about pppd (Im not sure how to configure
&gt; a chat script manually however and do not have pppconfig installed on the
&gt; system).  Is there any software that comes in RH that I can use to get an
&gt; internet connection happening?  Also, should I wish to install that
&gt; software, what is the best way to go about it?
&gt; 
&gt; Im a fairly new newbie...with a bit of experience.  Any help would be
&gt; greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,


RedHat should have installed *linuxconf* and *netcfg*. Both
of these are quite capable of setting up PPP connections,
DNS and so forth. However, I've found *netcfg* stuffs up
/etc/resolv.conf (the file in which the IP addresses for DNS
are stored by default), so I like to edit that myself. Use
the modem connection tool on the *control-panel* to connect
/dev/tty[whatever] to /dev/modem.

You will need the phone number, DNS IP addresses and
information about whether the ISP uses PAP or CHAP. Other
than this it is relatively straightforward - once it is set
up you can type as root "ifup ppp0" [or whatever it has
called it - it may be ppp1] and it should work. To power
down say "ifdown pp0".

I have written a short bash script owned by root but
executable by all users to avoid having to "su" each time I
decide to dial up. You can put that in any place searchable
by general user accounts. Alternatively, you can restrict
the access to only root access.

Finally, you'll find all config files in the following
places:

/etc/resolv.conf = DNS Information
/etc/conf.modules = I'm not certain but you can specify
aliases for data compression here
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts=You'll find
  chat-ppp0 (the chat script)
  ifcfg-pp0 (the settings passed to ppd)
/etc/ppp=
  pap-secrets = self explanatory
  options = self explanatory. The default is just "lock" so
two ppd's can't access the modem at once

OK?

DAVID.
