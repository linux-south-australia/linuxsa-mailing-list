&gt; I need to setup POP email server so the Windows client can access some local
&gt; email on a private Lan. From my limit knowage of sendmail this will not do
&gt; the job. Is there so other way of doing this. I would like to use Outlook
&gt; express to check the mail box on regular intervals.

Sendmail does half the job.  It accepts incoming mail and puts
it into the mailbox.

There is a universe of programs that will let you then access
that mailbox remotely.  The one you want are probably the University
of Washington IMAP/POP3/POP2 servers.

If you are working on a LAN and want most mail to be left on
the server, then IMAP is a good choice.  If you want people
to shift mail to their PCs, then POP is more widely supported.

At AARNet we use sendmail, imapd, procmail (for filtering mail)
and tcpd (for controlling access to the server) on the mail server.
All these come on the RedHat CD.  [I'm not sure about other
distributions, we've standardised on RH to keep support costs
down].

Staff use Outlook, Communicator, Pine, SuperMail and g*d only
knows what else to access their mailbox and folders.

The sendmail/IMAP/POP/procmail combo produces a better server
than Exchange, but sendmail does have some of the worst text
file configuration known to humankind [1].

There are good replacements for both sendmail and UoW IMAP/POP
if you have more than a few hundred users or run lots of
global mailing lists.

Cheers,
glen

[1] This might be unfair.  I've noticed that although sendmail
    might be a total mongrel to configure for the complex cases,
    it at least *does* let you deal with the complex cases, whereas
    other mailer software tends to run out of features well before
    that point.   In contrast, the UoW software has so few knobs
    to twiddle as to be worrying.
