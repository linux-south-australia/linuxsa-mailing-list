Please tell me this isn't your justification for calling him 'sonny'
repeatedly?

&gt;If the use of "son" and/or "sonny" can divert you from the points
&gt;of an argument, that is your choice.  A confident writer will not
&gt;be adversely affected by such labels; nor should his/her readers.

Quite the reverse is true. It is up to you to put your points across
succinctly. There was no need for patronizing labels. You should know by
now that it's often the way we say things that is more important that what
we say. If this were not true, we would be discussing your points on this
list rather than the way you put them.

&gt;Just skip over them... like we do banner ads... ;)
&gt;and weigh the arguments (of all sides)

Next you'll be telling me not to wear a suit to a job interview! Just go in
my pajamas? I'm sure they'll overlook the presentation.

&gt;Your applause for Craig is noted, and I'm sure he appreciated it.
&gt;But his arguments must stand for themselves.

You are correct. No one is disputing your points, just your delivery. Maybe
a simple acknowledgement that 'sonny' can be seen as derogatory, rather
that trying to justify it? That way you can continue with the discussion,
having also pulled the respect of your peers for your ability to concede
where necessary.

&gt;There... no son's or sonny's to distract/insult anyone.
&gt;
&gt;I'm flexible...  ;)

That's not quite what I meant cause it still comes across as patronizing.
Part of the art of speaking or writing is to get the audience on your side.
This is very helpful if you are expressing a point of view.

Like I said, it's not what you say, it's how you say it.

Cheers

Alex!
