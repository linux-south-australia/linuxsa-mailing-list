sorry about that last message :(

anyway, I had that exact network card in my laptop (but the card broke
later). Anyway, I got it to work without any special drivers, however,
there were a few things that managed to break the pcmcia software. I was
using RedHat 5.0 on the machine at the time, but it still worked.

Anyway, have you made your own kernel? When I did that(i also got the
kernel pcmcia stuff and compiled that after the kernel) , something broke
the pcmcia stuff, so I had to get the pcmcia rpm (I can't rememebr what it
was called, something like pcmcia-cs) and do a --force install. Note,
upgrading didn't seem to work, i had to make sure it copied over the files
without deleting anything, or maybe it was part of the upgrade script that
didn't work. Anyway, try re-installing the pcmcia rpm withthe --force
option. also I remember once the pcmcia stuff stopped working, so I did a
rpm -v name-of-pcmcia-stuff and it showed something was changed, so I did
a force install, and everything was happy again :)

also, I noticed that when installing linux, it asks for a supp disk when
installing. If i didn't insert teh disk (becuase I installed via cdrom)
pcmcia wouldn't work straight away, but if i did insert the supp disk
during install (and still isntall via cdrom) pcmcia did work without
configuring anything :)

BTW, I havn't used pcmcia on my laptop (under linux) in a long time, so I
hope this informationis still correct.

good luck,
Andy
