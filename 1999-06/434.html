&gt; Has anybody here had anything to do with Linux and y2k compliance?  I am using
&gt; linux as a file/web/ftp/squid/everything/ISoLoveLinux server at my place of
&gt; work, and we're partway through the whole y2k testing thing - and I'd like a
&gt; pointer to any resources, or and tips, or comments etc etc that will help me
&gt; out :)

You really must be more specific about distributions and versions.

As I was cursed and designated the Y2K coordinator for the uni
network infrastructure, and we use Linux in that infrastructure
I've had a look at it.  We have standardised on RedHat (because you
have to standardise on *something* in a big network and Debian
isn't sending me free CDs).

Basically, RedHat 6.0 is compliant.  RedHat 5.2 isn't, but will
probably work.  RedHat 4.x is really broken.  These issues aren't
so much Linux kernel issues, as coding errors in libc and glibc.
Search the linux-kernel list archive for the details.

RedHat have a compliance statement on its web site.  Like all
compliance statements, it was written by lawyers and is only
of use to other lawyers.
