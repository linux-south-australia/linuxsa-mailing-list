&gt; &gt; 1: ZOMBIES
&gt; &gt; Based on years of trying to kill zombies on my various linux boxes, I can

&gt; &gt; nothing works - they sit there when you do a ps ax  and they really piss
&gt; &gt; you off and then one day they just disappear of their own accord ;)
&gt; 
&gt;         Kill the zombie's parent process. Pid 1 then 'adopts' the zombie, and
&gt;         they disappear off system...

I don't know if someone has made this point or not already, but I think
a better answer to "How do you kill zombie processes?" is "_YOU_ don't."
Zombie processes are left behind when a child process dies. The parent
process has a right to retrieve the status of the child, or at least be
notified of the child's termination.
See wait() and waitpid() in your man pages for examples of how this is
done.
A well-written program would probably have a signal handler for SIGCHLD,
thus immediately catching the dying process, grabbing it's status, and
freeing the childs resources.
Even if without that, any kind of half-decent program would be sure to
at least check occaisionally for it's children.
So, if you're seeing enough zombies appearing, for long enough that you
notice them, then it sounds like maybe you have a program around that is
not doing all it should.
I would suspect that such a program would probably be homemade or else
fairly obscure - anything that became popular enough to be used by other
programmers would probably be patched up to work correctly by them.

To find out the owners of the zombies, run "ps aujx", or your preferred
variant. This will show the parents process ID in there. You can then do
a "ps auxw | grep thatprocessID" to see what the parent was.

&gt; &gt; 3: WOMEN ARE MORE ENIGMATIC THAN LINUX
They don't come with manuals either.
But, they do come in a range of aesthetic colours, shapes and sizes.
*runs to avoid lynch mob*

&gt; &gt; Hmmmmmm - interesting point..... have to admit that it is easier to get
&gt; &gt; linux to do what i want than to get my wife  to do what i want :-))
&gt; 
&gt;         Women are more enigmatic than VMS internals...
