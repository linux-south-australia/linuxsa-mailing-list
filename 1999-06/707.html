If you have installed Debian, you would have installed a base system,
rebooted, started the dselect package manager then installed the rest
of the software.  Red Hat is a little different.  It is booted of a
floppy or CD ROM and it installs the whole thing in one big go. 

The base package from Debian will not be of any use for RH install.

To save your current data, there may be several options.  Did you
create any partitions, if so, is one of them used for /home?  Maybe
you have a DOS partition.  These would be good places to put "data" if
you can recognise what is data and what are OS files.  

If you have not had the system running for very long, maybe all your
data would fit on a few floppy disks.

If you could be more specific about what you want to save from your
current system and what means you have to hold it during reinstall,
I'm sure that this list could offer more detailed advice.
