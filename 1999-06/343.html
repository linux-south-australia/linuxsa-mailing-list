&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; the problem i have with named is having dynamic IP assigned
&gt; &gt; addresses..so i have to list my two nameservers for ozemail first..can i
&gt; &gt; list localhost (127.0.0.1) as the third..will that stop sendmai hanging
&gt; &gt; as well? shld it perhaps be first?
&gt; 
&gt; Read the dns howto, one of the descriptions it gives is how to go online
&gt; to a single machine by coppying one dns config file. I normally setup the
&gt; single machines as looking at the hosts file first for IPs then dns. If
&gt; networked, this can vary depending on the local netowrk.
&gt; 

this is what I do also. in /etc/ppp/ipup-post etc, I have a named conf
file swap thing happening. Basically, one set of conf files is set up
properly, with the correct root server etc., and the other set of config
files (I think) are blank. This meams that when named tries to look
something up when we are offline, it comes back with "Domain not found".

The only thing that bugs me a bit is when you restart your nameserver
(do ndc restart) after swapping the config files around, it actually
does a "sleep 5" somewhere, which means that even though everything
looks right, you still wont be able to resolve anything for a while.

Also - I run squid - and I was wondering, when it first starts up, is it
normal to take a long time? (its a 486dx50 16megRAM 2gig, dedicated
700meg squid partition) I figure it must be indexing all the cached
objects or something. How long before it can answer queries?
