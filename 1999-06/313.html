&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I'm running MRTG on my machine to show modem usage (at the moment). For
&gt; the last 60 minutes or so I've ben running the modem at it's full speed
&gt; (it's connected at 33,6kbps, and wget claims i'm downloading at 4 kBps),
&gt; so I'd expect the mrtg graps to be at around 4kBps, but it's staying at
&gt; less than 1000Bps :( etc etc etc etc etc etc
&gt; ............................................

I ran MRTG (Say the whole thing fast- makes your  teeth fall out..
MultiRouterTrafficGrapher.mmmmmffffpphhh) for a while & didnt like it much.
ipac produces nice graphs.... also ntop is very nice .... only found that the
other day... you can run it as a daemon on any port (defaults to 3000) and it
produces interactive web pages.... .... as for RedHat-6.0....hmmmm... I dont
like redhat :) SuSE/CALDERA/Slackware are good!! I have one pc running redhat
& nothing ever works first go... something is always missing & i cant
compile... anyway, thats another story..

I suspect that RedHat probably ate the other 3k bandwidth ;) wouldnt suprise
me at all... it keeps eating all the files i need to compile anything!

Seriously, MRTG produced bizarre results for me which I put down to the fact
that I was running it from behind a firewall & it didnt like it... ntop IS
very GOOD! and requires next to no configuration to produce some quite
impressive stats.
Cyal8r, Phil
