If you have a look in /usr/doc/FAQ and /usr/doc/HOWTO, I believe in
recent distributions there is a Beowulf document there, that can explain
exactly what a Beowulf is, and how it works, and all your other
questions too.
It's probably more accurate than anyone else on this list, but feel free
to ask us if you don't understand parts of it.
If you can't find the Beowulf FAQ or HOWTO, then check the repository on
the internet for the latest version of the document.
I believe a linux Beowulf doesn't mean an exact system, but rather a
methodology and a set of common tools. 
It's more about distributed computing, than SMP/simultaneous computing.

That is, you divide a large job up into chunks, and each computer then
takes a chunk, processes it, and returns it to the master/shepherd
computer, which produces the result as a whole.

Many tasks are being done simultaneously, but they are tasks, or
processes, rather than actual CPU instructions, which is how some people
seem to believe the clusters work.

I don't actually have a Beowulf cluster, and I've only briefly looked at
the information on it, and that was a while ago, so I may not be quite
right here.
However, I hope this gives you a rough idea of what a Beowulf is, and
hopefully you can then understand the types of software that would
benefit from it most.
Things that require very fine granularity of processing chunks AND
require either linear, or else fairly linear or relational, processing,
will not really take advantage of a Beowulf cluster. THings that can
easily subdivide what needs to be done, and doesn't mind if the results
aren't in order, (or can easily and quickly rearrange them), will take
good advantage of a Beowulf.
Eg: If you have povray rendering animations, you could very, very easily
Beowulf-ise it.
Just give a frame to each machine, and when it's done, give it another
frame to do. Repeat until all frames are rendered, and copy them all
onto the master machine.
That's a very simplistic use of clustering/distributed-computing. True
Beowulf clusters tend to have a 'shared memory' pool (in our example,
that would be like having all the povray scenes accessed via the network
rather than rcping them over first), and processing is usually divided
on a finer level (eg. on a per-line or per-pixel basis, for our
example.)

I hope this helps,
Toby

&gt; what sort of hardware is run and how hard is it to set up?
&gt; are there any problems in setting it up?
&gt; 
&gt; I am interested in setting one up but though i would ask if anyone here
&gt; has done it.
&gt;
