&gt; I am using RedHat 5.1, KDE and Netscape 4.05. Seraching the Net most of
&gt; the time it all works fine, but sometimes I get this "lock" file in
&gt; ".netscape" directory. Then I have to deleted, exit Netscape, re-started
&gt; to be able to search again. Some sites I am accessing create this "lock
&gt; file" all the time and appart from lock, Netscape disappears completely!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone having the same problem?
&gt; Thank you anticipated,

Hi,

Are you, by any chance, opening a new netscape window to do the search? If
so, are you opening the new window by clicking on a netscape button in
kde? This would be the 'problem'. If you want to open a new window, (in
netscape) go to the file menu, then go to open, then new window (I think
alt-n does it too).

someone else probably can explain this better, or actually know what
they're talking about, but it's something like: only one netscape can
access the cache, etc at one time. If you use netscape to open a new
window, then it's the same run of netscape, but with more than one window.
If you click on netscape in the kde menus, you're loading a new netscape,
so you've got two 'versions' of netscape running, with one window each.

if you do this at a shell, "ps -A | grep netscape" You'll see how many
proccesses netscape is using. On my machine (redhat 6.0, netscape-comm
4.5) each 'load' of netscape uses 2 processes, but I can open many
windows, and it still only uses 2 processes.

anyway, that lock file is created by netscape when it is loaded, so if you
try to load a new version on netscape, it'll see the lock file and tell
you that it's already open. The lock file will be deleted when netscape is
quit cleanly (ie, as long as it doesn't crash, basicly)

hope this helps,
Andy
