&gt; &gt; I have just bought myself a 486 to use as an experimental/learning
&gt; &gt; machine. I was wondering if there were any docs etc on how to set up a
&gt; &gt; linux system from scratch without using a distribution. I basically want
&gt; &gt; to get gcc and a kernel running and then build it all myself from there.

Well there's no HOWTO because it's assumed (hoped) that people
creating distributions have a lot of UNIX and Linux experience.

If you really whan to start from scratch then:

 - cross-compile a kernel (or download a binary from
   www.kernel.org if you CPU is supported)

 - cross-compile bash and statically link it.

 - build your kernel and /bin and /etc onto a disk
   image file, copy the image file onto disk.  You
   can do this on floppy, although if I were doing
   this for work I'd use a removable hard disk.

 - boot single user and start bash rather than init.
 
 - problems?  Run a null-modem link between the
   target and development computers and use remote
   gdb.  You need to re-cross-compile the kernel
   for this.  You also need to be very careful about
   where you place breakpoints (We're not in user-space
   anymore Toto).

You can then build a hard disk containing the FSSTND 2.0
structure and populate it with a cross-compiled development
and run-time environment.

Cross your fingers and compile something.  Expect problems.

Compile an init system and boot multiuser.

Most of the user-level progams you need are available
from www.fsf.org (GNU), www.freebsd.org (BSD) or
sunsite.unc.edu. (Linux).

All these sites are mirrored at mirror.aarnet.edu.au.

I have done a port of Linux to a NSA 32-bit CPU for a
trusted systems project, so let me know if you get stuck.  


&gt; I'd like to know that too.  My set up on a partition is not going
&gt; too well.  I was thinking about putting Linux on my old 486 too and
&gt; have it running independently.

My home machine is a 486.  Issues are:

 - memory is expensive.  You want 32MB+.

 - disk sizes are limited by IDE addressing, meaning keeping
   an eye out for SCSI drives is a good idea.  For development,
   you want 1GB or so.

 - the RS232 ports probably need replacing if you want to run
   a 56Kbps modem.

These factors can boost the cost of a usable 486 above the
cost of obtaining a Pentium motherboard secondhand.

At work I have no problems dual-booting Win NT and Linux, except
that I keep forgetting my WinNT password from lack of use!  The
VFAT file system is really good -- you can boot WinNT, grab a
screen dump for the doco, reboot, and load the .BMP file on the
WinNT partition into Gimp directly.  I have lilo installed in
the MBR.

Cheers,
glen
