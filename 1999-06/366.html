I have been in trying to get an appointment with my MP for some time now and
finally have one on Friday. Ironic it should be just after the issue is to
be debated.
After reading Mark's post I rang my MP's office to confirm the appointment
and perhaps talk to him before the debate instead of after. No luck.
I was also informed the the MP's email had been having problems functioning
due to the number of mails on this subject that had been received.
Perhaps he now knows how it feels to have to vet data.

&gt; &gt; This is absolutely true -- But I'd strongly suggest avoiding email;
&gt;
&gt; Correct.  Discussions I've had with MPs suggest that writing a
&gt; letter to your MP is the best thing you can do as an average
&gt; citizen to bring attention to an issue.
&gt;
&gt; In order of effectivess, actions are:
&gt;
&gt;  1. a personalised letter
&gt;  2. a personalised fax (put in the pile with the letters by
&gt;     most offices)
&gt;  3. a telephone call
&gt;  4. a form fax
&gt;  5. a form letter
&gt;  6. e-mail
&gt;
&gt; Obviously, it is too late to send a letter, so heat up that
&gt; fax machine.
&gt;
&gt; If you are going to relocate out of Australia because of the
&gt; legilsation, then *please* fax Jim Lloyd MP.  He will be giving
&gt; a speech during the debate opposing the Bill, but being in the
&gt; Liberal Party, will be voting for it along party lines.  He
&gt; has said "...not heard of anyone threatening to leave Australia
&gt; or move their business overseas if the Act [sic] was passed".
&gt;
&gt; Obviously some people and business *is* going to move, so if
&gt; you are a reputable business that is going to shift then please
&gt; set the MP straight.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Glen
