<H1>Linux Users IDs and NT</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->

Here is one for you samba people out there.

I have a customer who uses NT as their primary file server.  They have
a Web Server running on a Linux Box.  

The intent is that the users can connect to the Web Server and modify
their files through Samba.  The system has been added to the Domain, 
and the few users that are on the machine authenticate through Samba 
to the NT domain.

The question is...

	Is it possible to synchronise the user names on the web server with
	those on the NT domain?  I have read of support for 'on the fly'
	addition of locked userids to allow the file system access to get
	a user id against it.  But it isn't clear what 'best practice' is
	in this respect.  Security in this environment is not paramount,
	so locked accounts getting created isn't too much of a problem.

My guess is that something like a weekly cron job to pick up a username/
group list to dump on the Linux Server would be appropriate.

Has anyone done something similar to this?

Regards,

Matt
