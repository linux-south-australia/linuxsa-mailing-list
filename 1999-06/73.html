&gt; I use RedHat 5.2.

&gt; I installed Star Office 5.1 and it decided that it didn't like the S3_Virge
&gt; drivers that I was using. This was OK. The Docs said that I'd be better off
&gt; using a plain old SVGA driver. I used Xconfigurator to change over to the
&gt; SVGA server...then the dramas started.
&gt; 
&gt; X decided that it wouldn't start at all. Essentially it says
&gt; "-X11TransSocketUNIXConnect:can't connect:errn=111". Naturally, this is
&gt; about as helpful to me as the Blue Screen of Death. It also states that the
&gt; "mode 800x600 doesn't has no entry". Yet in my XF86Config file ALL my
&gt; Screen / sub section display sections talk of a mode "800x600" and it does
&gt; exist in the monitor section (the section which lists all the hysnc
&gt; frequencies etc which appears above the screen section).
&gt; 

OK, this "Blue screen of death" does help me know what is wrong :)
Your problem sounds like it lies in your monitor setting. 

What?!? I hear you say.
How does my monitor effect this?

When you start X it looks at what video mode you have selected. (800x600)
Then it goes to the monitor section and looks at what mode lines are
available. (There is a few for 800x600 in /etc/X11/XF86Config) Next it
looks at the max/min horizontal/vertical refresh rates for you monitor.

Using these refresh rates it removes any entries that your monitor does
not support. In your case all of them.

This leaves the server in a state where it can't do its video startup.
Since the video side of X talks to the low level stuff using sockets, one
part of X can't talk to the other (as it didn't start) and hence you
get... "-X11TransSocketUNIXConnect:can't connect:errn=111"

&gt; After using Xf86Setup to try to rectify the situation, I determined that I
&gt; do have the SVGA driver installed AND *all* the S3 servers installed, hence
&gt; I don't believe my problem is "the server is not installed".

Neither do I.
 
&gt; I then tried to use Xconf (the text based program) to try to rectify the
&gt; situation. It said something to the effect that I should have "/usr/X11" in
&gt; my path *before* "/usr/X11R6/bin" (or whatever), but I can't work out how
&gt; to change the PATH variable, either at the command line or have it set at
&gt; boot. Interstingly, Xconf does get X to start - in 300x200 mode!!!!! 

Setting the path won't solve this problem.
You got the 300x200 mode as the monitor refresh rates where withing it's
limits.
 
&gt; In dos you simply state set Path=(whatever you want). In Unix, can you do
&gt; the same? I've tried adjusting it using something to the effect of:
&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; I don't understand. I thought my new path would have overwritten the old
&gt; one, but instead it just did something wacko.

Linux is a bit different to dos. You have a local environment & a global
environment. Different shells set the environment differently. You need to
set the global envronment.

Under bash the command you want is: export PATH=.....
Under csh: setenv path (......)


&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt; Not the 16th time :-(

Did you choose the correct monitor settings or assume they didn't matter?

&gt; I'm at wits end! Although I use the command line in Linux quite a lot, I
&gt; can't view my wonderful images or use gimp in bash - I *need* X. Are there
&gt; any suggestions of what might be wrong????

Agreed, a GUI is always handy - even if it's for netscape.
My suggestions it to edit /etc/X11/XF86Config and under the monitor
section put in the CORRECT settings. 

Ie. Mine are:

Section "Monitor"

    Identifier  "ADI MicroScan 4V"
    VendorName  "ADI"
    ModelName   "MicroScan 4V"

    HorizSync   31.0-64.0
    VertRefresh 50.0-100.0
.
.
.


PLEASE, PLEASE use the correct settings for you monitor else it can
(depending on the monitor) blow the thing up.

If you cant find settings safe ones normally are:

HS: 48-60
VR: 60-80

Cheers,
