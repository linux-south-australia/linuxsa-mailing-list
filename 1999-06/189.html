&gt; xf86config being purely command line, the others being more gui based:)
&gt; (i quite like XF86Setup)

actually.... :)

the version of XF86Setup that comes with RedHat 6.0 is GUI based :)
It loads X in VGA (since all cards should support VGA), then you can
setup lots of things, such as your mouse, keyboard, monitor, video card,
and there's some more options. Once You've finished setting it up, it
writes /etc/X11/XF86Config then loads X according to that file. All that
comes up is a box asking if you can see it, but you also have to option to
run xvidtune.

mainly to Stephen Donaldson : You may find this version of XF86Setup
useful (assuming you're using redhat 6.0), because when you set up your
video card, you have two options. You can either select the model of the
card (Diamond Stelth should be listed there, i think), or you can select
the server and the chipset that your card uses.

If you're not using RedHat 6.0, you can still download all the rpms needed
and 'upgrade' a previous version. You'll need the XFree86-XF86Setup and
XFree86-VGA rpms (yep, you need the vga server, even if you're not going
to use it).

I also like XF86Setup, now :)
mainly because it's easy (for me) to use, and still gives lots of options.
People that prefered the text version may be disappointed though. 

bye,
Andy
