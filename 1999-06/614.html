Hi,

&lt;Snip on long, interesting discussion to place my own view&gt;

You've touched on one thing I believe most strongly in, Education.

I think the solution to many of the parents fears about the internet is to
educate them in the use of the internet, and encourage them to browse with
their kids. I also think that parents should be encouraged to educate
their children that there is "Bad Stuff" out on the 'net, and why they
think it is "Bad", not just a blanket "You must not go there" by either
disiplin on by Software.

Consider that the Media has ratings on TV, Video, Books, and magazines.
Yes these media are alot ezier to control, but I see many sites with
"Adult" content on them these days don't only have some degree of
protection against getting in, but also have a rating. Perhaps children
should be encouraged to ask their parents, and parents should be there to
guide thier children.

Ofcourse I realise there are many social and political problem in doing
any of what I have suggested. Remember these are my beliefs, an I am
mearly expressing them. (Placed to suppress a flame war).

cya
