Heyas
I've been told I have to clear out some of my "junk" as others refer to
it. Most of it will go in the bin, but if people want stuff, you're
welcome to come and take it away. The main thing of interest is a pretty
old laser printer. Toshiba pagelaser12 from memory, comes with a fair
bit of free toner and misc. bits.
I'm warning you that it's gone a bit yellow with age, it's pretty slow,
and relatively low resolution (150 or 300 dpi I think). The drum isn't
quite perfect either, and it takes ages to warm up.
However, there's enough toner and bits to last for the rest of it's
lifetime, so if someone wants this laser printer and has some use for
it, feel free to take it away!
Free! (Note that any injuries to backs, incurred due to lifting the
heavy thing are not my responsibility.)

Also, I've got 4 ISA-style boards with Z80 processors controlling
several rs232 i/o ports each. I can't remember how to control them, and
the transformer for them was turned into a 50W amp long ago, but again,
they're free to whoever wants them. You could make a 24 port modem
terminal if you wanted to, I guess. If you could figure out how to use
them.

There's also a bunch of VESA cards of assorted types.
Mainly I/O though.

Also, there's some ISA VGA cards (trident) and a PCI 3Dfx card, but
these aren't quite free. 

Yours,
Toby
