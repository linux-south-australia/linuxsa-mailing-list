i agree. thanks,phil, for putting it so well!

craig was trying to put his point of view across..
having had many pleasant arguments with him, let me tell you a cpl of
things..

this is an intelligent, gifted, and qualified individual. patronising
him is insulting and merely makes those who do look foolish. differing
political beliefs dont mean insulting someone's professional ability,
nor denigrating them on the basis of age.
he has a right to express his point of view, as we all do, in the
reasonable expectation of informed debate, not personal insult.

for the record, i disagree with point 2 of the young libs suggestion. as
a parent, i choose what my children visit, and sit with them all when
they are online.
however, i know craig is fighting strongly, and for some time, on his
beliefs, and greatly respect his efforts. he IS against internet
censorship, very strongly, and  has merely been attempting to find a
middle ground. while i disagree with his middle ground, i think very
highly of him for suggesting it, and for the intense efforts he has
made.

cant we be civil in our disagreements?
