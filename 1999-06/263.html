&gt;HELP!!!
&gt;
&gt;I have just finished setting up a new RH6 server with samba and everything
&gt;was going great until will tried to run a Advanced Revelations dbase from
&gt;the server. With one use logged into the Arev program there was no problem
&gt;but when the second logged in and try to access the same menu they were
&gt;locked out. If the first logged out the second could login etc. The
&gt;programmer seems to think that it is a Unix record locking problem as it was
&gt;running fine!!! (apart from all the crashes) on Win95 workgroup. The
&gt;programmer has no experience with Linux and couldn't help me. Has anyone had
&gt;any experience with Arev apps and samba.

Hmmm, Which version of Samba are you using? Recent versions (since about
1.9.18p4 or so) have OpLock support, and it is on by default.

However, I have seen problems where programs do not understand or like
OpLocks. This seems especially relevant if you say it worked under a Win95
workgroup. WinNT has OpLock support, Win95 does not.

So, try to add "oplocks = no" in the share that has the AREV db.

&gt;Steve Sloan
&gt;
&gt;PS the workstations run Win95 with a map to the exported drive on the server
&gt;where the entire Arev program lives.
