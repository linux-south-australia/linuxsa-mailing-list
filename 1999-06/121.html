That is about 100% correct.

I have used MPI whilst doing a Parallelism and Concurrency course. It
doesn't quite have a shared memory pool like SMP does but each machine
starts a/many copy/ies of the process so it can be used on homogenous OS's
that support MPI and compile the same code, ie Linux, Solaris, SunOS (in
fact that is how we did it!).

Please don't ask for any more details, I can't remember (this was a couple
of years ago, and haven't played with it since).

Rob.

P.S. I think there is a version of Povray out there that is already to go on
to a Beowulf machine.

&gt;If you have a look in /usr/doc/FAQ and /usr/doc/HOWTO, I believe in
&gt;recent distributions there is a Beowulf document there, that can explain
&gt;exactly what a Beowulf is, and how it works, and all your other
&gt;questions too.
&gt;It's probably more accurate than anyone else on this list, but feel free
&gt;to ask us if you don't understand parts of it.
&gt;If you can't find the Beowulf FAQ or HOWTO, then check the repository on
&gt;the internet for the latest version of the document.
&gt;I believe a linux Beowulf doesn't mean an exact system, but rather a
&gt;methodology and a set of common tools.
&gt;It's more about distributed computing, than SMP/simultaneous computing.
&gt;
&gt;That is, you divide a large job up into chunks, and each computer then
&gt;takes a chunk, processes it, and returns it to the master/shepherd
&gt;computer, which produces the result as a whole.
&gt;
&gt;Many tasks are being done simultaneously, but they are tasks, or
&gt;processes, rather than actual CPU instructions, which is how some people
&gt;seem to believe the clusters work.
&gt;
&gt;I don't actually have a Beowulf cluster, and I've only briefly looked at
&gt;the information on it, and that was a while ago, so I may not be quite
&gt;right here.
&gt;However, I hope this gives you a rough idea of what a Beowulf is, and
&gt;hopefully you can then understand the types of software that would
&gt;benefit from it most.
&gt;Things that require very fine granularity of processing chunks AND
&gt;require either linear, or else fairly linear or relational, processing,
&gt;will not really take advantage of a Beowulf cluster. THings that can
&gt;easily subdivide what needs to be done, and doesn't mind if the results
&gt;aren't in order, (or can easily and quickly rearrange them), will take
&gt;good advantage of a Beowulf.
&gt;Eg: If you have povray rendering animations, you could very, very easily
&gt;Beowulf-ise it.
&gt;Just give a frame to each machine, and when it's done, give it another
&gt;frame to do. Repeat until all frames are rendered, and copy them all
&gt;onto the master machine.
&gt;That's a very simplistic use of clustering/distributed-computing. True
&gt;Beowulf clusters tend to have a 'shared memory' pool (in our example,
&gt;that would be like having all the povray scenes accessed via the network
&gt;rather than rcping them over first), and processing is usually divided
&gt;on a finer level (eg. on a per-line or per-pixel basis, for our
&gt;example.)
&gt;
&gt;I hope this helps,
&gt;Toby

&gt;&gt; Does anyone one the list run a beowulf clusterand if so, what software
&gt;&gt; makes best use of the multiprosessing? examples?
&gt;&gt; what sort of hardware is run and how hard is it to set up?
&gt;&gt; are there any problems in setting it up?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am interested in setting one up but though i would ask if anyone here
&gt;&gt; has done it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; thanks
