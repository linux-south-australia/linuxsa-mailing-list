 &gt; I'm running RedHat V5.2, Kernel 2.0.36. I would like to route packets

 &gt; possible with this version, is it possible with the later versions?

Hmm - I've just looked at the ipfwadm stuff from one of the kernel 2.0.36 
Slackware systems at work, and it doesn't appear to be in there.

There's another free OS you can do it with, but I won't mention it here
for fear of getting shouted down &lt;grin&gt;

 &gt; Ip based routing wont work in this situation as I cannot predict where the
 &gt; packets are going and route them accordingly.

Understood.  I'd suggest checking out the functionality in ip_filter,
which is a bit like ipfwadm on steroids.  I haven't looked for this 
bit specifically in its docs, but it seems to have everything else :-)

Additionally, FreeBSD's "ipfw" functionality includes a "fwd" keyword
which allows you to specify a next-hop IP address for packets which
match a given access-list clause (oh dear, now I've done it).

Cisco routers provide policy-based routing as well, where you can define
an access-list to describe the packets you're interested in treating 
"differently" and a routing policy to describe what "differently" means,
including the specification of an output network interface or next-hop
IP address.

If you want more info on any of the above, let me know.
