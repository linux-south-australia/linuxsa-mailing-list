I was speaking to a couple of people from LinuxSA at an auction in 
recent weeks. I haven't been able to make it to many meetings for the 
last 
six months because of, amoung other things, work committments. I was 
very dissappointed to find out I'd missed a legal summary of the 
internet legislation.
I have been taking an active role in the debate over the 
government's internet censorship legislation, talking to members, in 
the debate, etc. I was particularly concerned to be told that may 
people believe that such legialation is the Liberal Party line. I hate 
this situation: young liberals and student liberals have for years 
voiced their opposition to exactly the sort of legislation as is being 
introduced. I've been doing a bit of follow up to try to put as much 
pressure on the parliamentary party as possible. Last night we put up a 
motion at yl state council as follows:

"The Young Liberal Movement (SA Division) believes:

1. The Federal Governemnts should revoke its recently introduced 
Internet Censorship legislation as it is unworkable and will deter 
investment in the telecommunications sector.

2. That legislation forcing Internet Service Providers to make web 
content filtering software available to new customers within the price 
of their service is a worthwhile means of addressing parent concerns 
about Internet content"

It was carried.

I know that many of you would disagree with the second half of the 
motion. However, it seems clear that the governemnt are determined to 
do something to give parents help controling their children's access to 
the internet, and if that is the case, then point 2 above would be 
arguably the best way to ensure that that is the case. I don't think 
that anybody would argue that that outcome is not far better than the 
legislation continuing in its present form and killing off the 
industry. Please resist any temptation to respond with flaming because 
of the second part and recognise what we're trying to do.

I hope to put the motion up at the SA Liberal Party State Council in a 
few weeks time.
