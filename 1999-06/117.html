Sorry if you have already read this, but it is quite good, and relevant to
this group  :

<A HREF="http://www.salonmagazine.com/tech/log/1999/06/07/linux/index.html">http://www.salonmagazine.com/tech/log/1999/06/07/linux/index.html</A>

Talks about how Linux may be classed as 'restricted content', or unviewable
by minors in Australia ... hmmm.

Tis interesting to see which terms the proposed filtering software may be
blocking ...

words like :
Gothic        (block out those architecture sites please, they give me
vertigo)
Pierced      (Damn - there goes my 1001 Recipies for your Microwave Oven
site)
Tattoo        (No more military band sites from Edinburgh Castle, thank you)

** WARNING - the following content may offend ***






















** You have been Warned ****






















** Here it is ***

If the law does get all the way through, maybe we could lobby for the
banning of all content containing such offensive terms as :
VB                  (some new disease ?)
Visual Studio   (some sort of private hangout for voyeurs and queers)
NT                  (hackers abbreviation for a Pamela Anderson site .. she
has / had Nice T***&lt;bs&gt;&lt;bs&gt;&lt;bs&gt;&lt;bs&gt; Teeth)
Excel              (A term used by young people to describe the state they
reach when taking ecstacy)
Access           (A term used by paedophiles to denote an easy to use place
'That playground has good access')
Back Office     (Gay people use this term to describe particular offices and
corporations where promotion is favourable for them)
Front Page      (Nickname for any site that gets right into it from page 1 -
'That is a real FrontPage site !')
FoxPro           (abbreviated name for a lady_of_the_night who uses the
internet to peddle her wares)
InterDev	          (Any site with InterDev as a meta-tag is more than
likely being used to host chat rooms for Internet Deviants)
Exchange        (as in exchange of bodily fluids)

SideWinder / SideWinderPro / Explorer / Explorer 2000     - Sites that
contain these words are more than likely selling battery powered items that
no respectable person should be interested in.
