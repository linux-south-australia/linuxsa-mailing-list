Sounds like you need to get tcp/ip working properly first. 
Try "ping 127.0.0.1" and see what happens, if it's negative look at tcp/ip.
Always try ping before telnet or anything else on tcp/ip problems.
I haven't had to mess around with it yet on my linux box so can't give you
more detailed help.

Subject: Problem with internal networking


Hi,

When I initially installed My RH5.2 box, internal networking worked fine,
that is, without configuration I was able to telent to localhost, and run
a web server from localhost.

Due to various reasons, I had to start from scratch, with a RH6.0 and now
I can't telent to localhost, or even to 127.0.0.1

I have read through the DNS howto, and tried various things there, and
even tried setting up my own virtual domain, and then the complete reverse
with removing lookups from anything except /etc/hosts

If i try
Telent localhost
I get
trying 127.0.0.1....
Host is unreachable
or words to that effect.

Nslookup says it can't find the name server for 127.0.0.1

Ie, it seems to me that dns is working, but it can't find a route to the
local host.

Where do I go from here ? The machine is never likely to conect to
anything else in the near future, but I need the web server working for
some development work.

All help greatfuly apreciated.

cya
