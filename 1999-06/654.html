Hello Kevin.

The problem you're describing usually occurs when the operator does not
understand what they're
doing.  You've further highlighted this fact with your comment about
"techno-dribble".  You're
obviously a little stressed with the situation, so slow down, and look at
the problem step by
step.

- Do you know the IRQ and address of your network card?
- Are the cards set to Plug and Play mode?  If so, change that ASAP.  It is
possible, but not
  enjoyable to set up Plug and Play under linux.  There are valid and
understandable reasons
  for this that I won't go into now.
- Do you know the types of your network cards?  Or their compatibility?
- Are you able to load the drivers under linux?  Do you know how to?

That should be enough to help us help you to start with.

Good luck.

It took me just under 40mins to install and configure two network cards into
two Windows 95 computers and have them sharing CDROMs, printers etc. (and
that was with a busted hand).

Two full days - still can't do it with Linux. Guess that's why Bill is soon
to be a trillionaire. Oh well, I'll keep wading through the techno-dribble,
it won't beat me. I assume Redhat 5.0 can do it? Is there any documentation
that uses terms like; Call this computer PC1, this PC2. Call the workgroup
'Thegang' instead of rambling about hostnames, nameservers etc and then
changing the meanings of the terms halfway through the story....

Kevin
