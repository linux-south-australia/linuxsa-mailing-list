&gt;I'll keep wading through the  techno-dribble, it won't beat me. I assume
&gt;Redhat 5.0 can do it? Is there any  documentation that uses terms like;
&gt;Call this computer PC1, this PC2. Call the  workgroup 'Thegang' instead of
&gt;rambling about hostnames, nameservers etc and  then changing the meanings
&gt;of the terms halfway through the  story....   Kevin 

Hmmm, 

Firstly, can you get rid of the HTML CRAP please :-)

Secondly, it is really not so hard. I do Samba and Windows and TCP/IP and
Linux, and things like that, so I may be able to help.

If you are talking Linux to Linux, then you do not need workgroup names.
However, if you are talking Windows to Linux, then you need Samba, and
Workgroups become relevant.

Perhaps in the light of that, you could restate your problem.  We can then
focus our collective experience on your exact problem, rather than our
imagined view of your problem.
