ANNOUNCEMENT

I have decided to write a "lilo" look-alike running under MS-DOS. I have
done this because of a personal need. I've had so many difficulties getting
my Windows Box and Linux Box (the same machine) to behave themselves, that
I have given up even attempting to get "lilo" to work whilst Windows95 is
on the system.

"lloylo" will attempt to redress this problem by imitating as far as it can
the look, feel and configuration files used by "lilo", however, running
under MS-DOS.

This pre-release version is a very BASIC version of what "lloylo" will look
like. It has no features, everything is hardwired into the C code and you
need to have a file called "linux.bat" in the same directory as the
"lloylo.exe" file.

I am using Borland C++ 4.52 to develop "lloylo" and licencing it under GNU
Copyleft. I have included the actual distribution as a WINDOWS zip (it's
not actually intended to be used under the Linux environment) and also a
basic text  README file I have developed for it.

DAVID
