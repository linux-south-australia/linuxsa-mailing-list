I was involved in the Internet Project, a joint project
of the ACT PC Users Group, AUUG (ACT), and ACS (ACT).
We provided Internet access to members when BBS ruled and
ISPs were thin on the ground and somewhat Sydney/Melbourne
oriented.

Such a project isn't possible nowdays.  This is because
of two factors:

 1) At the top end there are siginificant economies
    of scale.  You need a lot of money to buy a Cisco
    5300 and a 2Mbps link.  To pay it off you need a
    high level of utilisation.  LinuxSA isn't a big
    enough customer base to purchase this sort of gear.

 2) At the bottom end there are lots of garage-based
    operators.  They usually use a PC with a multi-
    port card and a rack of modems.  A few modem lines,
    or maybe an ISDN link, provide upstream connectivity.
    The gear is cheap, as it is usually castoffs from
    bigger ISPs.  Busy signals are common, as there
    is little reserve for peaks and poor capacity
    planning is a reflection of the poor business planning
    overall.  Prices are cheap, as they usually fail to
    account for all their costs in the price, usually
    leading to a sudden cessation of service when birds
    come home to roost.

Any LinuxSA-ISP would simply be squeezed between these forces.

LinuxSA could cut a deal with an ISP for reduced access rates
for members, especially if LinuxSA offered account establishment
support rather than the ISP.  But this would require the
volunteer time of a few LinuxSA people, and I think you would
be scratching for volunteers after the first few weeks.

LinuxSA could also make a submission to the current bandwidth
enquiry.  Nothing would make the Internet connections cheaper
so much as:

 - opening up non-modem access.  Third party interconnect
   should be allowed to the cable networks.  The last mile
   of copper should be a public, rather than 50% private
   resource.

 - preventing the international telcos from darkening the
   soon-to-land fibre capacity from AU east coast to ConUS
   west coast.

 - correcting the provisions of the telco act to allow
   transition of traffic above the network layer between
   non-telcos.

Cheers,
glen
