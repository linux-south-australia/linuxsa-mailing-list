Sounds like a great Idea,

I remember once before you have posted an email which stated that for
certain cases linux was better but in other cases FreeBSD was better (or
something along those lines). I would be interested to hear more.

&gt; In one of the smaller conversations I had in the discussion bit following
&gt; the last LinuxSA meeting, someone suggested the idea of a talk on the
&gt; topic of FreeBSD.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this something that'd be likely to be suitable for a talk at an
&gt; upcoming meeting, or would I be stoned to death as a heretic? :-)
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW, FreeBSD people aren't OS bigots (as I hope I've demonstrated over
&gt; the years from my conduct on this list), and are actually more likely
&gt; to recommend Linux than FreeBSD for many applications (especially the
&gt; development of commercial software for free OS platforms).  It does
&gt; have a number of (unfortunately) unique features which Linux users often
&gt; aren't aware of;  it might be beneficial to free software in general
&gt; if some of those features lose their uniqueness, such as the Ports
&gt; Collection, CAM (ANSI) SCSI kernel APIs, time-tested TCP/IP support,
&gt; and a bus-independent I/O system.
&gt; 
&gt; I could also talk about the differences between the way FreeBSD and
&gt; Linux are developed, the role of the "core team" and CVS committers,
&gt; and distributions.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any interest in a discussion along those lines?
