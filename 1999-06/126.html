&gt; List,
&gt;
&gt; Tried mounting a CD that I have just added to a previously installed system
&gt; (the first CD was robbed to repair another machine). As root I changed to
&gt; the mnt dir and entered:
&gt;
&gt; mount cdrom
&gt;
&gt; Response was:
&gt;
&gt; wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/cdrom or too many mounted
&gt; file systems

Linux is detecting your cdrom drive otherwise you wouldn't get the above
message.
Try for experiment 'mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom  /&lt;&lt;your mount point&gt;&gt;'
probably /mnt/cdrom.  What happens?  Next, look in /etc/fstab and check
for a reference to the cdrom.  This is the file linux looks at when it
mounts file systems.  It should have iso9660 as file system type.  Which
hardware device is it associated with?  What is the disc you are trying
to mount?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; When checking the hardware setup through DOS the CD works OK. My setup is:
&gt;
&gt; IDE 1: 7Gb HD partioned (but I forget which is which, I know the 133 is
&gt; swap!), 1702, 1004, 698, 1702, 133 all in ext2
&gt; IDE 2: 3Gb HD partioned 1012 (Fat32) 2048 unused with IDE sec of CDRom
&gt;
&gt; Questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Is there a limit to file systems you can mount? If so where is it
&gt; configured?
&gt; 2. I know I should know the answer to this one, but what is a block device?
&gt; 3. I am still getting used to Unix dev structures, nothing like DOS C:\ D:\
&gt; to pollute the mind eh? - but I am having difficulty visualising what dir is
&gt; on what physical drive. Any pointers for easier understanding?
Linux doesn't present hard drives as separate drives like DOS does. If
you were to add another drive and use fstab to mount it during boot it
would appear as a directory that you specify. For instance, I mount my
dos partition on /cdrive, or drive D: which to linux is hdc1 on /drived. 
The names aren't predetermined, you can call them what you like.

Cheers
Conrad. 
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance
