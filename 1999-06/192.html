&gt;I am trying to get a shutdown UPS cable going on a RH6 box using a Sola 310
&gt;UPS. Sola have been quite helpful and reassured me that I have the correct
&gt;cable and the correct software (Sola provides a Checkups program that
&gt;monitors the UPS via the serial port). The basic command to test the UPS is
&gt;
&gt;checkups /dev/ttyS0
&gt;
&gt;This returns with a message that the cable is not attached. Sola advised me
&gt;to check if getty is grabbing the port and to make sure the port is setup
&gt;for a modem. As far as I can tell getty isn't using any serial ports as
&gt;there are no entries in the /etc/inittab file and as for setting the port
&gt;for a modem, I have no idea.

Steve,

I don't have any experience with UPS software but I think I can point
you in the right direction to get the serial port working.

It appears that Sola have asked you to set up the port /dev/ttyS0 for 
use with a modem, meaning that flow control should be managed in hardware.  
Apparently, the default setting for serial ports is XON/XOFF but the UPS 
application expects RTS/CTS handshaking, when it doesn't get it, it
assumes that the CTS/RTS lines are not connected and wrongly complains
about the cable being detached.

Your friends in setting serial ports are stty or setserial - take a
look at the man pages.  Briefly, use "stty -a &lt; /dev/ttyS0" or
"setserial -a /dev/ttyS0" to examine the settings.  BTW, ttyS0 is
COM1 right?  Next set handshaking to RTS/CTS.  If you were mucking 
around with a modem, you could use a comms program such as minicom 
or cu to talk with the device hence prove that the settings are right
- look in your UPS manual to see if it can be interrogated using plain 
text.

Finally, you will want to make the above changes permanent.  On my
Debian system I did this for my PPP link by editing the file
/etc/rc.boot/0setserial.  It could just as easily be put in the same
place from which the ups software is started eg /etc/inittab or the
applicable /etc/rc* file on your system.

Hope this helps,
