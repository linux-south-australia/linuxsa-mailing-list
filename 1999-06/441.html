&gt;   Daniel&gt; How do you kill zombies?
&gt;
&gt; Grenades are usually the best, but if you've got plenty of rockets,
&gt; use your rocket-launcher.
&gt;
&gt; Another answer: you don't kill them; they're already effectively dead.
&gt; RTFM.

A few comments:

1: ZOMBIES
Based on years of trying to kill zombies on my various linux boxes, I can
tell you that the reason they are called zombies is because they are
already dead & therefore cannot be killed & therefore are zombies &
therefore killing them is pointless because they are already dead &
therefore cannot be killed because they are zombies & therefore cannot be
killed because they are already dead thats why they are called zombies...
cos they wont bloody DIE!!
killall -TER|MINATE_WITH EXTREME_PREDJUDICE (zombies)   ;)
nothing works - they sit there when you do a ps ax  and they really piss
you off and then one day they just disappear of their own accord ;)
fascinating really.... its like...ummmm, where DO deleted characters go????

2: SOMEONE wanted to Know abt SUSE vs REDHAT vs etc etc etc
I run Caldera SuSE & RedHat - already mentioned in a previous post that I
dont really like redhat... Caldera is Nice but must admit i prefer SuSE and
your machine should be fine although I do find that 20+Mb is nice for
making KDE Purr

3: WOMEN ARE MORE ENIGMATIC THAN LINUX
Hmmmmmm - interesting point..... have to admit that it is easier to get
linux to do what i want than to get my wife  to do what i want :-))

4: RTFM
I agree totally with the RTFM concept....however are you familiar with
EWANO & PUTAV
I will share an anecdote with you all abt RTFM (I assume everyone knows
what it means!)
When I started teaching myself linux (and it took a while cos Mt Gambier is
not overrun with linux devotees even now - and this is 3 odd years ago) I
kept finding these bloody  "core" files everywhere.... i was forever doing
stuff, crashing apps & then finding more "cores"... One day
I decided to devote an entire afternoon to getting rid of all these core
files... I really didnt understand find or grep or locate back then so
using
MC I just went from directory to directory and when I found a core file I
deleted it ( I had managed to figure out they were not essential files)
Anyway, I was quite please cos I had deleted abt 10Megs of the damn things
when buggerme I found a 28Mb core file - HELL, I was rapt, up until now
they had all been between 200K & 500Kb - now I could reclaim 28Mb in one
hit!! the file was /proc/kcore  - ( I am sure that many of you are now
wetting urselves laughing) --- anyway... I spent 2 hours trying to delete
kcore.... I examined it i tried everything - I figure it was a real super
"core file" cos it had K in front of it-- sort of like the Special K of
core files I suppose!!

Well, I RTFM'd everything I could find but really I didnt even know what I
was looking for & I just couldnt get a handle on this bloody KCORE file
that wouldnt be deleted .
I decided it was probably a close relative of all the zombies I got when I
did ps -ax
(NB: Back then doing a ps with a minus ax didnt get you a "- depracated
warning like it does now:))
RTFM my Bum.... it was 4 months before I found a linux guru to ask what the
hell a KCORE file was...
geez, did I feel like a DH.... but he was a nice guy... & he didnt tell me
to RTFM ... he understood that if you are just learning/teaching urself
that RTFM is not so simple as it is when you are already a Guru! (or a
Quasi-Guru)  ^& you know HOW to RTFM!!

I mentioned at the beginning of this the terms EWANO & PUTAV...... here are
the definitions:!
EWANO (Everyone Was a Newbie Once)
PUTV (Patience Understanding & Tolerance are Virtues


Cheers, PHIL

PS: If you dont understand what the /proc/kcore file is & you dont want to embarrass urself on here.......

u can email me direct & I will enlighten you :)
