Re:  Swedish JavaRadio Source Code
        to be distributed for Free... with a
        "we'll implement it here" catch...

The author & webmaster of JavaRadio
(a scanner that you control & listen to
remotely; also has a chat window, so
you can share the controls with other
concurrent listeners around the world)
is still offering his source code FREE.

Like the JavaRadio itself (which re-
quires a show of Knowledge to use),
there are a few prerequisites:

To get the source, one must agree to
set up a JavaRadio in their neck of
the woods, so to speak.

To substantiate the agreement, one
must supply both the serial number
of a *specific* ICOM (0.5 - 1300 MHz
capable) radio -and- a fixed IP-
address for the intended web site
(not to mention an ISDN or faster
link for the JavaRadio-to-listeners
connection...)

It's a bit of an ask for the uninitiated
(or uninterested, for that matter) but
it is not without precedent (c.f. NIH's
amateur radio club's similar radios)

At the moment, just 10 people (of
perhaps 30+ applicants) have got
the OK to receive JavaRadio's
source...

I've got a request for relaxation of
the "only one model of ICOM radio"
condition, since it seems to me
that a JavaRadio with wider radio
handling capabilities would spread
wider than one that supports just
the author's choice of radio... but
I don't know how it will be received.

If anyone here is interested in put-
ting Adelaide on the map/list of a
few places in the world where a Java-
Radio is located (i.e. so people any-
where the I'net reaches can hear
local broadcasts, comm's services,
etc. - just like we can now listen to
local Swedish transmissions of all
these types today, i.e.

  www.JavaRadio.com),

now's the time to make your interest
known (directly to the author/webmas-
ter of the JavaRadio site), by finding
such a radio's s/n and a fixed IP-adr
for your intended JavaRadio site.

Actually, somebody in the Hills - hey
Geoffrey, are you listening? - would
have a good location for a JavaRadio.

Of course, the system includes a Linux
server, under the hood...

In fairness, I must report that also in
the system is a Win 95 box, for some
reason... (subject to modification, I
trust...); to preclude any matters of
conscience (vis a vis buying Win95)
I am willing to contribute a genuine
Win95 CD-ROM (& bona fide license)
to the project, i.e. as a member of any
team that can pull it off.

Of course, I would expect to have shared
access to the source code, which I would
like to help get modified to work with some
*other* model(s) of radio than the one for
which it was originally designed...

Any takers?

(Alternatively, you can mount a similar
engineering effort of your own, e.g. for
/with the support of a local radio club,
be it shortwave/scanner listeners or
amateur...)

Details of the JavaRadio, its design,
and the source code offer are all to be
found at the above URL.

Let me know what you come up with.
