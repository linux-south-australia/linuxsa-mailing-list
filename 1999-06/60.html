HELP....

I use RedHat 5.2. 

I installed Star Office 5.1 and it decided that it didn't like the S3_Virge
drivers that I was using. This was OK. The Docs said that I'd be better off
using a plain old SVGA driver. I used Xconfigurator to change over to the
SVGA server...then the dramas started.

X decided that it wouldn't start at all. Essentially it says
"-X11TransSocketUNIXConnect:can't connect:errn=111". Naturally, this is
about as helpful to me as the Blue Screen of Death. It also states that the
"mode 800x600 doesn't has no entry". Yet in my XF86Config file ALL my
Screen / sub section display sections talk of a mode "800x600" and it does
exist in the monitor section (the section which lists all the hysnc
frequencies etc which appears above the screen section).

After using Xf86Setup to try to rectify the situation, I determined that I
do have the SVGA driver installed AND *all* the S3 servers installed, hence
I don't believe my problem is "the server is not installed".

I then tried to use Xconf (the text based program) to try to rectify the
situation. It said something to the effect that I should have "/usr/X11" in
my path *before* "/usr/X11R6/bin" (or whatever), but I can't work out how
to change the PATH variable, either at the command line or have it set at
boot. Interstingly, Xconf does get X to start - in 300x200 mode!!!!! 

In dos you simply state set Path=(whatever you want). In Unix, can you do
the same? I've tried adjusting it using something to the effect of:

set PATH=(whatever I typed in)

And then it turned up with (when I typed set to get a listing of all
environment variables):

"
Path=(whatever the old path was)
...
[something like]_Path=(what I typed in
"

I don't understand. I thought my new path would have overwritten the old
one, but instead it just did something wacko.

After all this trouble I decided to do the tried and tested reinstall
method. I tarred all the files I needed, threw them onto my Windows
partition and went for a reinstall.

I've installed RedHat 5.2 about 15 times (at least). EACH time X Windows
has worked, after the 10th time I worked out how to get RedHat to set my X
up perfectly so that I could just log in, type "startx" and hey presto...X
comes up.

Not the 16th time :-(

This time I've reinstalled RedHat 5.2 and it still comes up with the same
error. Note, I had RedHat format all my Linux partitions thus wiping out
EVERYTHING on the partitions and install basically onto a clean hard drive.

But still no go.

I'm at wits end! Although I use the command line in Linux quite a lot, I
can't view my wonderful images or use gimp in bash - I *need* X. Are there
any suggestions of what might be wrong????


DAVID.
