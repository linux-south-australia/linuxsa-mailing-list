&gt; Hiyas...
&gt;
&gt; If I run fsck, It usually reports bad summary info -I'll fix it, but
&gt; the file writing problems are no different. A bit later, I'll refix
&gt; the summary info again.
&gt;
&gt; Do you think this could be a case of a dying harddrive? I'm got two
&gt; partitions - dos and linux, and the dos partition has had no
&gt; troubles, but for the last few days linux has been really sick
&gt; ;(((((
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone any ideas?

Here's a gut feeling...

Try doing a df -i, this will tell you how many inodes (effectively
clusters in DOS-speak)
are availabe.  If you have lots of small files then your inodes could go
before disk space.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'm ahppy to let ppl telnet in and have a look sometime if they
&gt; reckon they can fix stuff up.

Might take you up on that one.

&gt;
&gt; secondly - what's the best way of backing up a linux set to a dos
&gt; partition?
&gt; or would it just be easier to make a 2nd linux partition, and copy
&gt; everything to it?

Depends what you want to do.

Probably the best way to do it is do a
      find / -newer file.date

Which will give you a list of files used/abused/created/whatever since
the date of the
file 'file.date'.  This way you can get a vanilla installation, copy
your edits off and save them.

So in short you could do a
       tar -cvzf backup.tar.gz `find / -newer file.data`

*note* the back quotes (under the ~) which executes the command in
quotes and lets
you use the output as command line arguments.
