Well, I suspect that no-one is going to ask me to start this, so I better
get off my bum and just do it :)

*Firstly* don't send me any results yet!! The account don't even exist,
it's a waste of your time.

Proposal:

E-Mail survey results to <A HREF="mailto:ossurvey@tardis.apana.org.au">ossurvey@tardis.apana.org.au</A>

Send at most one entry per ______? (timeframe)

No subject line.

Body of message is as follows:

	1 line per operating system
	each OS line contains:

	OS,percentage:task,percentage:[task,percentage]...

Clear as mud ay? A solid example:

linux,70:wp,20:games,5:inet:40,play:35
win95,25:games:80,wp:20
dos,5:games:100

This means that:

I use Linux 70% of the time. When I'm using Linux, 5% of the time I play
games, 20% of the time I do word-processing, 40% of the time I'm on the
internet and 35% of the time I'm just fooling around with it.

Another 25% of the time I'm using Windows 95. I play games 80% of the time
with that, a bit of word processing the rest.

Lastly, I use DOS occasionally, just for games..

Notes:

Only count the time you are actually using your computer. If you leave
your computer on 24hrs (like me), only include those actually spent at the
keyboard. It would slew the results a bit if you leave your computer on
running Linux, but don't actually use it that much, but you boot Win95 for
a game of Sega Rally every now and then. 

I have to fix the operating systems and the tasks list, for my own sanity.
A proposed starting point is:

Operating systems:
------------------
linux
os/2
dos
win95
win311
nt (any version)

Tasks:	(I'm sure I've left heaps of obvious stuff out of here)
------
wp	Word Processing
db	Database
ss	Spreadsheet
games	Entertainment type games
play	Just fooling with the OS
inet	Surfing the internet
graph	Creating/Editing graphics
bbs	Frequenting Bulletin Boards
install	Still struggling to get the OS in question installed
other	Something esoteric

What else do we need added to this list?

To guard against my actually learning perl and automating this, case is
important, and don't add any spaces or other crud. At first I'll do it by
hand, so I'll be sure to punish any offenders :)

Also, how often should this happen? Weekly? Bi-weekly? Monthly? Keep in
mind I am connect via UUCP, a day or two without communication is not
unusual, so I don't want it too tight.

Any other comments? Mail me or reply to the list, please.

	- Justin
