Howdy folks,

I was reading Toby's Corkindales message about his stuffed up filesystem
when this question popped into my head:

-I get weird errors in my fs every now and then too. Is there
some regular maintenance that should be carried out on an ext2 fs. (Apart
from e2fsck)


-Also, ages ago I posted about depmod -a reporting unmatching symbol
defenitions. Sorry I can't include the message - I lost it!, but for those of
you that remember and wanted a solution:

When I had rebuilt the kernel, I had done it a few times previously before
and got sick of going through make config all the time.

I discovered a hidden file in the source directory called .config which
looked exactly like the settings I had chosen for the config process. I
thought 'cool I won't have to do it anymore' and saved it elsewhere.

L8er when I had completely reinstalled the OS, I copied my saved file back
and rebuilt the kernel this time skipping the make config bit.

I can't tell exactly why (I'm only just starting to learn about make) but
this caused the version mismatches, because when I reinstalled the source,
deleted /lib/modules/2.x.xx (on many peoples advice) and rebuilt the kernel
properly, the errors were gone.


-Has anyone ever managed to configure their PC so that DEL is actually DEL
(as opposed to backspace)? (even in xterms)
 
Staf
