&gt; ok - what if the machines you use are for servers and all that..... i mean
&gt; i have 6 machines that stay on 24 hours a day, of these 4 are linux boxes

&gt; but primarily used for tech support.....

OK, so count server as 'work' and call it Linux:100,server:100

&gt; maybe divide it up in slackware, redhat, others or sumthing like that

That's a different survey :)

&gt; &gt; Tasks:	(I'm sure I've left heaps of obvious stuff out of here)
&gt; &gt; ------
&gt; &gt; wp	Word Processing
&gt; &gt; db	Database
&gt; &gt; ss	Spreadsheet
&gt; &gt; games	Entertainment type games
&gt; &gt; play	Just fooling with the OS
&gt; &gt; inet	Surfing the internet
&gt; &gt; graph	Creating/Editing graphics
&gt; &gt; bbs	Frequenting Bulletin Boards
&gt; &gt; install	Still struggling to get the OS in question installed
&gt; &gt; other	Something esoteric
&gt; server  many people do this
&gt; html    www pages
&gt; prog   programming
&gt; bbs2  running a bbs

yep they're all OK with me.
html means writing them, not reading :)

Hmm, come to think of it, the server bit is proving tricky. I guess some
of your machines that are servers are also being used for work as well,
right? Damn Linux for multitasking anyway!!!

&lt;big grin&gt;

Hmm, what to do about that, lets see. Maybe just those whose boxes are
also 24-hour servers put a note to that effect with their survey, and
leave it out otherwise. Those who use them as servers periodically, for
instance cranking up Apache to let someone temporaily view some pages, put
them in as above.

&gt; i will try and get some perl script done as well - then it'll be a bit
&gt; easier and i may be able to run it on tne

Thunder-stealer :)
