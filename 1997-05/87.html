&gt; ok, that's fine for ppl running X-Windows.  what about those of us
&gt; locked into a text based system through drive space requirements?
&gt; any ides?
well, I knew someone was gonna say something about that. All I can say is
bad luck, I can't help you with an easy solution. I can try and explain
how I got it working. FYI I run RedHat 4.1 and keep in mind that this is
from memory (which is not always the best:)

Firstly, I read the PPP-HOWTO!!! Yeah, I made the effort. 

I'll describe what I did and if you have specific problems, ask. 

I copied the ppp-on and ppp-off script from /usr/doc/ppp-2.2.0f-s/scripts
to /usr/sbin and the ppp-on-dialer to /etc/ppp.

I modified the ppp-on script to reflect my phone number username and
password and made sure that the DIALER_SCRIPT variable pointed to the
right location. ppp-off does not need to be modified and neither does
ppp-on-dialer.

NOTE: If your dialup server expects you to enter something (eg
ppp&lt;return&gt;) before it starts ppp then you have to add another line to the
ppp-on-dialer script. This line depends on what exactly it asks, but to
give you an example, If after you log into the server it says something
like "Enter a selection and press return:" and the selection you have to
make for ppp is "ppp" then you can add the following to your ppp-on-dialer
script (making sure you add a \ at the last line of the current one):
	return:		ppp

This should work for most ppp dialups (unless I forgot to mention
something).

Then I started using chap authentication. This means I had to modify the
ppp-on-dialer script and take out the last 2 lines (ogin: and assword:)
and also the \ of the CONNECT line.

then I modified my chap-secrets file to read something like

#client		server	secret		IP address
username	*	passwd		

where username and passwd where my real username and password.

To start dialup all I have to type is ppp-on. To stop it, ppp-off.

That's it. Easy! I hope it helps some of you out there.

BTW: By default the debug option on pppd is set on. If you go to a second
virtual terminal (eg Alt-F2) you can run the command
"tail -f /var/log/messages" and keep an eye out for any server messages
you get.
