Dear colleagues..

There are two flaws which are interfering with my enjoyment of LINUX 

They concern XFree86 :

1/ I accidentally specified the first serial port for the pointing 
   device ( mouse ). This was a bad choice... My Windows 3.11 for 
   Workgroups is set up to use the mouse on COM2: This means that I 
  have to swap the mouse around all the time.. 

  Q: How can I force LINUX to use the second com port for the mouse?
       Is this device referred to as /dev/tty01 ?
       Do I simply abandon the /dev/mouse device?
       Or do I have to re-compile this device driver in some way?

2/ I am 40 years old and I find that the fonts in X are way..  too 
    small to read easily.. I find myself working with my face pressed 
    up against the screen .. wearing reading glasses.. This is all 
   most tiring.. I would like to make the default font for X much larger.

   Q: How is this done?
        Is the .Xdefaults file relevant?
        Which man page contains descriptions of all the codes in the 
        .Xdefaults and .xinitrc files?

I am quite happy to "RTFM" on any of these issues... but I would most 
appreciate advice on which "TFM" to read.

Yours sincerely

Andrew Allison
