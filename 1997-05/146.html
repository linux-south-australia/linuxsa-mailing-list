Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;What I was hoping is that there would be two topics, one aimed at
&gt; &gt;beginners,
&gt; &gt;and one aimed at more advanced users.  The LinuxFS for beginners,
&gt; &gt;RPM for
&gt; &gt;advanced.
&gt; &gt;Matt
Absolutely.  Too often there is too much assumption about the abilities of attendants.  I'm sure Geoffrey and Matthew had this in mind anyway!


&gt; 
&gt; Why not a general meeting? Shoot the shit about anything (except Doom 
&gt; ;-) Those who want special meetings can always organize to get together.
&gt; If you wanna a special subject I suggest "How Linux will improve your 
&gt; sex life."
Yes, well...You obviously aren't married!!! ;-)  My belief is that if subject matter isn't preconcieved then there is the tendancy to fragment.  This is fine for after a meeting, but meetings themselves should be for the greater edification of all as a unit.  The opportunity for the experienced to share with the green newbies (a la moi) em masse is of benefit to all (there's always something that even the "experts" can learn as well), without the fragmentation.  The clicks that would inevitably form are degenerative in my opinion.

&gt; 
&gt; However, I'll agree with both topics you suggest. It's the one for DOS 
&gt; idiots like me that I am worried about...
Anyone who's willing to have a go at DOS is ideal for Linux, not an idiot at all.  It's the people who'd rather stay blind to what's happening and how it's achieved that are not for Linux imho.  (There are none so blind as those who will to not see)
