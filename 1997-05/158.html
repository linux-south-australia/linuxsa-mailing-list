Hiyas...
I've been running linux happily for quite a wile now, but just the other day I received an error message while trying to save some tiny file (.cshrc or somethnig), and since then, this error has plagued almost everything I do.
The error varies from program to program, but essentially, nothing will write to my main partition, every write failing because 'file too large'. It occurs with anything above 0bytes (ie. touch will create a file all the time, but trying to write a file of any size fails about 90% of the time. Some files will just 'work', but most don't. Needless to say, I've tried checking various things, but I can't find anything obvious that could be causing this..
The kernel I'm using is 2.0.29, which has been fairly stable, and I don't beleive it to be the cause..(although, of course, it could...I'll try and find an old kernel later..)

If I run fsck, It usually reports bad summary info -I'll fix it, but the file writing problems are no different. A bit later, I'll refix the summary info again.

Do you think this could be a case of a dying harddrive? I'm got two partitions - dos and linux, and the dos partition has had no troubles, but for the last few days linux has been really sick ;(((((

Has anyone any ideas?

I'm ahppy to let ppl telnet in and have a look sometime if they reckon they can fix stuff up.

secondly - what's the best way of backing up a linux set to a dos partition?
or would it just be easier to make a 2nd linux partition, and copy everything to it?

Hopeing,
Toby

...Careful with that axe, Eugene!
