&gt;&gt; ;-) Those who want special meetings can always organize to get together.
&gt;&gt; If you wanna a special subject I suggest "How Linux will improve your 
&gt;&gt; sex life."
&gt;Yes, well...You obviously aren't married!!! ;-)

Wrong! Thirtieth anniversary tomorrow (May 26). But I'm a journalist. I 
know what headlines sell. "How WIN95 destroyed my marriage" or "Free sex 
over the net: We list all the sites".

My belief is that if subject matter isn't preconcieved then there is the 
tendancy to fragment.  This is fine for after a meeting, but meetings 
themselves should be for the greater edification of all as a unit.

Not hard. You need a guy in charge of the meeting. One bang of the gavel 
and you're out! All it really needs is a guy who really knows how to run 
a meeting. I seen meetings with an aggenda without a proper person in 
control and the damn thing has ended up in shambles.

Opportunity for the experienced to share with the green newbies (a la 
moi) em masse is of benefit to all (there's always something that even 
the "experts" can learn as well), without the fragmentation. The clicks 
that would inevitably form are degenerative in my opinion.

Cliques cannot be avoided. So what? But that implies rivalry. Chose your 
weapons gentlemen. Perl script at 50 paces. So from a group of 75 you 
end up with three groups of 25 (hypothetical). Is that a bad thing? You 
want parliament without an oppostition? Jeez, even the parties have 
their factions, and these are professional politicians.

&gt;It's the people who'd rather stay blind to what's 
&gt;happening and how it's achieved that are not for Linux imho.

Anybody who is prepared to stay blind will not attend a meeting. Why 
should they? To promulgate blindness? I can soon shoot them down.
