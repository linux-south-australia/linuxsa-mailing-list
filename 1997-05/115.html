&gt; personally i would like to see a post install tour/discussion on the
&gt; software and file structure, and what all those /etc/bin directories are !
&gt; :)


if it is this saturday please remember to harass Aidan (the building 
operator) about how he got the TNE routing going..... it was all done on 
linux boxes.... palso i may bring a machine along to set-up as a proxy 
server.... (for myself of course) as i can't be bothered doing ti - well 
i can - just i'm going to melbourne for an ascend presentation.... should 
be interesting.... i'll try and scam some stuff about ascend products for 
linuxsa ppl to look at.
