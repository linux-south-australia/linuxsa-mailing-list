&gt; To anyone who can help!
&gt;
&gt; My Banksia MyFastModem (internal) is intermittant in it's responce
&gt; to the
&gt; computer.  Slow reponse time ~10-20 seconds (or more)
&gt; It was previously used with Gatesware95.. maybe this is the problem?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I can get to it from 'minicom' and send it instructions..
&gt; eg. ATA - picks up the line, ATH - hangs up
&gt; but it take time to do so..
&gt;
&gt; I can actually even dial up with it... but my ISP's prompts come
&gt; back in 'chunks' ~10-20 seconds apart, often without the first
&gt; chunk missing.
&gt;
&gt; The modem doesn't display CONNECT xxxxx
&gt;
&gt; I've looked at the serial port using 'setserial' and making any
&gt; changes there
&gt; only stops it working altogether.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestion?
&gt;

There have been some modems recently, that have had all the Error
correction, and Compression
routines in a windows driver that does it for you.

Do you have a "modem driver" for win95?

I haven't done much work with these modems so I can't help you if it is.

Another possible gotchya is the interrupts/ioports.

If you have a look at the output from dmesg you should find a few lines
about the Serial driver.

That will display the ioports and irqs for each of the serial ports
(including the modem).

My guess is that you are sharing either IRQ4 or IRQ3 and the other
serial card is grabbing most
of the interrupts.
