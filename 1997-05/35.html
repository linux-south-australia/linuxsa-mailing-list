Before I write this message *again* I'll give you all my linux tip of the
day - avoid svgalib applications like the plague. I don't know if it's
just svgalib, or my graphics card (CL-5426), but *every* single Linux
crash I have ever had has been due to an svgalib application. 

&lt;/RANT&gt;

&gt; I would like to make a few more comments on the LinuxSA web pages.
&gt; Currently they are at <A HREF="http://www.tne.net.au/linux">http://www.tne.net.au/linux</A> and will soon be moved
&gt; to <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au">http://www.linuxsa.org.au</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Now I would like some group feedback on what people want to get out of
&gt; the web pages...

[Hope I can remember all that I wrote before]

The pages are pretty good, certainly nice and quick to load being so
local, even though my live access isn't up to much. I guess this means we
can be less concerned about image sizes and so forth, disk space
permitting!

General Suggestions:

1) More information on what goes on at meetings. The web page doesn't
really say too much. A narrative of a (or every?) meeting would be good,
even better with links to pictures of key speakers, opened computers with
guts spilling out installing Linux etc :)

2) Statistics! Don't know why, but I love statistics. First the obvious
things, like head counts at meetings, computer counts at meetings, mailing
list members, etc. 

Then something else, for instance a bi-weekly survey could ask those on
the mailing list to tell what operating systems they are using. Then we
could graph it and put it on the web pages. Hopefully month by month the
Linux bar would go up, and the Windows one down :) 

I don't see that this could be too difficult to setup. GNUPlot could do
the graphs, I could probably accept the survey data on my box...

Maybe I'm getting crazy here :)

3) Mailing list archives. Indexed and searchable, of course :)

Hmm, I'm sure I had some more ideas. All gone in the bit bucket thanks to
svgalib :( Oh well, if they come to me, I'll be sure to post them.
