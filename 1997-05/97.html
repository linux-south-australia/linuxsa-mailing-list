&gt; Notes:
&gt; 
&gt; Only count the time you are actually using your computer. If you leave
&gt; your computer on 24hrs (like me), only include those actually spent at
the
&gt; keyboard. It would slew the results a bit if you leave your computer on
&gt; running Linux, but don't actually use it that much, but you boot Win95
for
&gt; a game of Sega Rally every now and then. 

ok - what if the machines you use are for servers and all that..... i mean
i have 6 machines that stay on 24 hours a day, of these 4 are linux boxes
used as servers, and one is a win95 box - with some server software on it -
but primarily used for tech support.....

&gt; I have to fix the operating systems and the tasks list, for my own
sanity.
&gt; A proposed starting point is:
&gt; 
&gt; Operating systems:
&gt; ------------------
&gt; linux

maybe divide it up in slackware, redhat, others or sumthing like that

&gt; os/2
&gt; dos
&gt; win95
&gt; win311
&gt; nt (any version)
&gt; 
&gt; Tasks:	(I'm sure I've left heaps of obvious stuff out of here)
&gt; ------
&gt; wp	Word Processing
&gt; db	Database
&gt; ss	Spreadsheet
&gt; games	Entertainment type games
&gt; play	Just fooling with the OS
&gt; inet	Surfing the internet
&gt; graph	Creating/Editing graphics
&gt; bbs	Frequenting Bulletin Boards
&gt; install	Still struggling to get the OS in question installed
&gt; other	Something esoteric
server  many people do this
html    www pages
prog   programming
bbs2  running a bbs

&gt; What else do we need added to this list?
&gt; 
&gt; To guard against my actually learning perl and automating this, case is
&gt; important, and don't add any spaces or other crud. At first I'll do it by
&gt; hand, so I'll be sure to punish any offenders :)
&gt; 
&gt; Also, how often should this happen? Weekly? Bi-weekly? Monthly? Keep in
&gt; mind I am connect via UUCP, a day or two without communication is not
&gt; unusual, so I don't want it too tight.

i will try and get some perl script done as well - then it'll be a bit
easier and i may be able to run it on tne

&gt; Any other comments? Mail me or reply to the list, please.

nah - i think i've hassled u enuff
