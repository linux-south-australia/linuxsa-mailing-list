if people are interested i am happy to provide a few e-mail addresses for
linuxsa members... maybe something along the lines of:

<A HREF="mailto:fs-help@linuxsa.net.au">fs-help@linuxsa.net.au</A>	for sumone who knows a heap about various file
systems 			under linux
<A HREF="mailto:install@linuxsa.net.au">install@linuxsa.net.au</A>	for sumone who is happy to help people with
installing linux

etc etc.

if you have any ideas e-mail me, and if you have any suggestions for people
who should be able to do some part then don't hold back.... these could
then be included on the www page as "experts"

anyway - just a thort - and i haven't checked it with anyone who seems to
have much to do with stuff :)....  

i'll just be adding this stuff to my mail aliases file.... maybe we could
do a similar thing with linuxsa.org.au, the linuxsa.net.au one could be
charged and is for people who use Linux to try and make money, and
linuxsa.org.au could be used for the home user who likes the idea of linux
being free......

all money gained from the linuxsa.net.au aliases will then be given to
LinuxSA so we can perhaps get some stuff for future presentations, or maybe
just to pay for some coffee and biscuits at the meetings...

i dunno - just my ramblings - i'm sure you'll get more from me sometime
when i start rambling again...

till then

have a nice life and don't die wondering :)
