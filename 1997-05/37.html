Before I write this message *again* I'll give you all my linux tip of the
day - avoid svgalib applications like the plague. I don't know if it's
just svgalib, or my graphics card (CL-5426), but *every* single Linux
crash I have ever had has been due to an svgalib application. 

no comment A^2

&gt; With the soon to be launched linuxsa.org.au site getting ready.
&gt; I would like to make a few more comments on the LinuxSA web pages.
&gt; Currently they are at <A HREF="http://www.tne.net.au/linux">http://www.tne.net.au/linux</A> and will soon be moved
&gt; to <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au">http://www.linuxsa.org.au</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Now I would like some group feedback on what people want to get out of
&gt; the web pages...

[Hope I can remember all that I wrote before]

The pages are pretty good, certainly nice and quick to load being so
local, even though my live access isn't up to much. I guess this means we
can be less concerned about image sizes and so forth, disk space
permitting!

General Suggestions:

1) More information on what goes on at meetings. The web page doesn't
really say too much. A narrative of a (or every?) meeting would be good,
even better with links to pictures of key speakers, opened computers with
guts spilling out installing Linux etc :)

Yes please.....
although meetings at the levels
on weekday evenings..
are hard for me to attend

At least I could read the summary..

2) Statistics! Don't know why, but I love statistics. First the obvious
things, like head counts at meetings, computer counts at meetings, mailing
list members, etc. 

Then something else, for instance a bi-weekly survey could ask those on
the mailing list to tell what operating systems they are using. Then we
could graph it and put it on the web pages. Hopefully month by month the
Linux bar would go up, and the Windows one down :) 

Yes please... I would be interested to hear about what people 
actually *DO* with their LINUX machines.. To take the analogy with a 
car club... It is fine to talk about engines and clutches &c.. &c... 
but occasionally... it would be noce to go for a drive somewhere and 
*DO* something that does not neccessarily involve rearranging the 
hardware of the machines...

For my part.. I am interested in LINUX as a programming environment.. 
I am interested in writing programs in ANSI C to solve scientific 
problems.. The sort of thing that one might find in the "NUMERICAL 
RECIPIES IN C" book..

I would be interested to find out about other applications..
accessing the WWW .. playing DOOM &c.. &c.. although that is not my 
primary interest.

I don't see that this could be too difficult to setup. GNUPlot could do
the graphs, I could probably accept the survey data on my box...

Yes.. GNU Plot is good..
For me.. it was automatically installed along with Red Hat Linux V4.1

Maybe I'm getting crazy here :)

3) Mailing list archives. Indexed and searchable, of course :)

Yes please..

Hmm, I'm sure I had some more ideas. All gone in the bit bucket thanks to
svgalib :( Oh well, if they come to me, I'll be sure to post them.
