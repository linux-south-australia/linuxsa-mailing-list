&gt; new to unix/linux. haven't got much of an idea but willing to learn.

That is what LUGs are here to do....

&gt; i have recently installed linux (red hat 4.0) with the help of a
&gt; friend.
&gt; it appears to be running o.k ( using vi editor) but other than that
&gt; I have
&gt; got no idea as to how to mount my a: drive or how to get my printer
&gt; going.
&gt; is there anyone who could give me some 'simple' step by step
&gt; instructions as
&gt; to how i can get these things working. I have tried to read the
&gt; 'howtos' on
&gt; the web with no success. any help would be greatly appreciated.

There are a couple of ways of accessing floppies.

First, you can use mtools, which mirrors most DOS commands, but
precedes them with m (mdir, mmd, mattrib, ....)  do a man mtools to find

out more.  Just watch out when doing wildcards (the shell sometimes
expands them out).

The other way is mounting the floppies into the filesystem.
This is usually done from the command line.  There is some assembly
required
you have to put an entry into your /etc/fstab.  Contact the list for
more
information.

For the printer, under redhat 4.1 there is the printtool, which allows
you to set up
print filters and similar things to allow you to print postscript to
non-postscript printers.

Other than using an integrated print filter, it get's a bit messy.
There might be
some good printer filters out there, can anyone comment?
