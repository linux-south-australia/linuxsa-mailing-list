&gt; Dear colleagues..
&gt;
&gt; There are two flaws which are interfering with my enjoyment of LINUX
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; They concern XFree86 :
&gt;
&gt; 1/ I accidentally specified the first serial port for the pointing
&gt;    device ( mouse ). This was a bad choice... My Windows 3.11 for
&gt;    Workgroups is set up to use the mouse on COM2: This means that I
&gt;   have to swap the mouse around all the time..
&gt;
&gt;   Q: How can I force LINUX to use the second com port for the mouse?
&gt;
&gt;        Is this device referred to as /dev/tty01 ?
&gt;        Do I simply abandon the /dev/mouse device?
&gt;        Or do I have to re-compile this device driver in some way?

Do the following....

rm /dev/mouse
ln -s /dev/tty01 /dev/mouse

Or run
/usr/sbin/mouseconfig (preferred)

&gt;
&gt; 2/ I am 40 years old and I find that the fonts in X are way..  too
&gt;     small to read easily.. I find myself working with my face
&gt; pressed
&gt;     up against the screen .. wearing reading glasses.. This is all
&gt;    most tiring.. I would like to make the default font for X much
&gt; larger.
&gt;
&gt;    Q: How is this done?
&gt;         Is the .Xdefaults file relevant?
&gt;         Which man page contains descriptions of all the codes in the
&gt;
&gt;         .Xdefaults and .xinitrc files?

The Xdefaults file will be the standard (I find the font 10x20 quite
readable (and large)).
A line like

     xterm*font:   10x20

should do it.

But things like the X startup xterms will use the X switch -fn 9x13
switch to the xterm binary.

I can't remember which file they are in, but do a grep xterm .* in your
home directory should find them
(or dump heaps of stuff to the screen :)

&gt;
&gt; I am quite happy to "RTFM" on any of these issues... but I would
&gt; most
&gt; appreciate advice on which "TFM" to read.
&gt;
&gt; Yours sincerely
&gt;
&gt; Andrew Allison

Hope we can stop you resorting to that :)

Matt
