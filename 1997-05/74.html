// heaps of jim's stuff has been edited out of my reply.  please read his
post first!

Jim Tucker Spaeketh:

&gt;(1) Somebody has to be in charge. Declare yourself in charge. You will
&gt;need a committee, of course. Elect yourself to all positions. Including
&gt;treasurer. Never be secretary. That implies somebody keeping minutes of
&gt;a meeting which is a real pain in the ass..

shouldn't a member who is an accountant be treasurer? isn't it just EASIER
to let people deal with areas of expertise?  

&gt;(2) Don't ask for opinions.

what is this?

&gt;(3) Incorporation is bullshit.

unless you are being sued

&gt;(4) Avoid putting anything to a formal vote

???

&gt;(5) If things fuck up offer to resign immediately. Some other dumb
&gt;bastard will offer his services and things will still fuck up.

and this 'dumb bastard' just inherits the club's library, hardware, bank
account, and liabilities? - or should i say matt's library, hardware...

&gt;(6) Don't take anything seriously. If it ain't fun it ain't worth
&gt;doing. Make it as informal as possible but with quiet control.

don't take anything seriously!? guns, the law, north korea, zaire? :)

&gt;(7) The best exchange of ideas is not held during any meeting. They
&gt;happen after the meeting, especially after a couple of beers or
&gt;whatever. People seek out people with similar situations/problems..

i propose all meetings be held at the exeter, 11pm wednesday night :)

&gt;(8) Buy and sell is part of every meeting. If you can carry it bring it
&gt;along. If you have a used Cray just let me know.

definately

&gt;(9) Everybody will, on condition of entry, fill in a form stating areas
&gt;of expertise. The object being to get to know strangers with similar

this is a good idea, and it could be put on the web. Justin Hawkins even
went as far as to suggest regular surveys with plots of current operating
system usage! (nice one jus!:)

&gt;interests. There will be no formal record of members. This is, after
&gt;all, just a bunch of guys who get together whenever to shoot the shit.

but what about posterity? :)

&gt;(10) Guest speakers (one per session) are allowed to flog their wares.
&gt;Ten minutes maximum. If the guy is wearing a blue suit it's five
&gt;minutes.

for sure (stripes==two minutes max)

&gt;(11) Grab some sponsors, but guarantee them nothing. If they dump in
&gt;$100 and expect to rabbit to a captive audience of 50 for 30 minutes
&gt;they are stupid. Let them organize their own audience.

i agree, well they can put up their logo at meetings, on the web pages
etc.
(wherever we can ignore it :)

&gt;(13) Let others, besides those who are reading this, know you are
&gt;holding a meeting which will be fun. 

too right

&gt;(14) The odd midnight meeting could be fun. That's for *real*
&gt;programmers.

mmm

&gt;(15) Do not have a membership list. That implies a formal club.

members are shareholders in 'the club' as members change, so do the people
who own 'the stuff'. if things "start to fuck up" we vote on what happens
to it, where it gets sold, donated etc.

////////end/////////

the point behind incorporation is to allow a seperate legal entity (the
club) to own things, bank accounts, subscriptions, hardware. also to make
money - just think, cd-roms and other publications, services, you know -
the product of our combined efforts... also if any problem comes about
legally or financially 'the club' will help save some peoples' butts.
this is just my (un-asked for) opinion. i agree that an informal land
would be great, if only someone could figure out how to overthrow the
law.:)

sorry to have disected your message like this. (are you a monarchist?
teehee:)


i would not be prepared to wear liability for a bunch of other people.
