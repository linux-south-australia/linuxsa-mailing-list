&gt; I recently attended a meeting in the Waymouth Tavern..
&gt; It was very smoky and I was most uncomfortable.   :-(

That's not hard to fix. Ban smoking in the room. Or more politely
request that the meeting area be non-smoking. I smoke, but have no
objection with that.

&gt; I was not able to buy a meal at the counter   :-(.

I told Shirley how many people would turn up and she arranged a cook.
Besides, this is bit spurious because if you hold a meeting in the Town
Hall on Saturday arvo I doubt whether you could get a meal. Even the
pie cart doesn't arrive until six ! We could have BYO sandwiches ;-)

&gt; I *could* buy alcohol but then.. Do you want to be drunk when you are 
&gt; trying to program a computer... Do you think that you might make more 
&gt; mistakes that way?  :-)

Never. Creative code, mate :-).

&gt; A pub would not be my first preference for a meeting place.
&gt; I would rather drive further and attend a better meeting place
&gt; somewhere else.

Respected. But having attended meetings around the world I usually
found the best exchange of information came after the damn meeting when
everbody got together in an informal atmosphere... over dinner or
getting pis ... er, having a few drinks.

I am a bystander in all of this. A group will never entirely agree
where and when.
