&gt; Well, it looks like Greenhill road is *tentatively* the place...

An old fart jumps into this, Matt. (I started the Osborne User Group
when Adam was a boy). I organized a few net seminars and made a few
bucks before everybody discovered it was a good idea. Some thoughts,
take them or leave them.

(1) Somebody has to be in charge. Declare yourself in charge. You will
need a committee, of course. Elect yourself to all positions. Including
treasurer. Never be secretary. That implies somebody keeping minutes of
a meeting which is a real pain in the ass..

(2) Don't ask for opinions. There are too many. Never ask where or
when. You are an intelligent guy so you decide. Some poeople will love
you, some will hate you. The place you choose will conflict with the
night they have to attend the sewing circle and the venue will be too
far from their prefered location (the Baptist church hall just two
blocks from home).

(3) Incorporation is bullshit. Then you need money. You have to elect
officers and somebody in charge of the books. It also involves the
government. Simpler is to just ask everybody to leave a donation at the
door to cover expenses. This is your money to spend as you like. If
they do not like that arrangement they can either not attend or leave
zero dollars.

(4) Avoid putting anything to a formal vote. Just get a feeling for
what you reckon is good, then do it. Or get somebody else to do it.
Somebody will always disagree with what you are doing. They are welcome
to form their own group.

(5) If things fuck up offer to resign immediately. Some other dumb
bastard will offer his services and things will still fuck up.

(6) Don't take anything seriously. If it ain't fun it ain't worth
doing. Make it as informal as possible but with quiet control.

(7) The best exchange of ideas is not held during any meeting. They
happen after the meeting, especially after a couple of beers or
whatever. People seek out people with similar situations/problems..

(8) Buy and sell is part of every meeting. If you can carry it bring it
along. If you have a used Cray just let me know.

(9) Everybody will, on condition of entry, fill in a form stating areas
of expertise. The object being to get to know strangers with similar
interests. There will be no formal record of members. This is, after
all, just a bunch of guys who get together whenever to shoot the shit.

(10) Guest speakers (one per session) are allowed to flog their wares.
Ten minutes maximum. If the guy is wearing a blue suit it's five
minutes.

(11) Grab some sponsors, but guarantee them nothing. If they dump in
$100 and expect to rabbit to a captive audience of 50 for 30 minutes
they are stupid. Let them organize their own audience.

(13) Let others, besides those who are reading this, know you are
holding a meeting which will be fun. (Let me know, a couple of pars to
Grantley Edwards at The Advertiser. I did that and &gt;50 people rocked up
and paid $45 each to hear how the net works. Answer: With difficulty).

(14) The odd midnight meeting could be fun. That's for *real*
programmers.

(15) Do not have a membership list. That implies a formal club.

Having said all that, I will say only that I have been there, done
that. I use DOS, I write Intel ASM, I have a few programs on SimTel and
if somebody can tell me how to write a regular expression in Unix I
will be eternally grateful. I connect to iinet via Telix and use a
shell account. I use WIN for www only when I have to.
