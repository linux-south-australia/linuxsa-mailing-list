&gt; &gt; Hmm, come to think of it, the server bit is proving tricky. I guess some

&gt; &gt; Hmm, what to do about that, lets see. Maybe just those whose boxes are
&gt; &gt; also 24-hour servers put a note to that effect with their survey, and
&gt; &gt; leave it out otherwise. Those who use them as servers periodically, for
&gt; &gt; instance cranking up Apache to let someone temporaily view some pages, put
&gt; &gt; them in as above.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that is unfair.  My personal box is the LinuxSA mailing list
&gt; server, and it runs 24x7, but I don't think it should be left out of
&gt; the survey because of that non-primary role.

OK, but I meant to add that we should add some sort of note as to how many
systems are running as servers as well. I don't want to leave you out! :)
