&gt; &gt; I am desperately in need of some 4 meg 30 pin 70 nS
&gt; &gt; simms. If you have any surplus for sale, please let me
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to be the bringer of bad news, but 4M 30p simms are now oficially the
&gt; hardest ones to get. You'll find 'em, but unless someone does you a favour,
&gt; don't expect a good deal!!

This is unfortunatly very true.

I can supply them new but you are looking at $59 each and minimum of
4 units per order!

I can at times get them on special for $46 but you have to prepaired to
wait... and wait... :(

I think I will use this oppertunity to metion an idea I have had.
I am in the process of getting some web pages online and I was thinking
of having a second hand page where people can leave discriptions of any
second hand hardware they want to sell and their contact details.
Kinda like the trading post online, for computer gear, for free.
I would probably use some sort of cgi scripty thingy! You can see I
really know what I am talking about. :)
This would help free up this group so that it could return to being a
linux group again.
If anyone thinks this is a good/bad idea, has any comments/suggestions/
addvice, or knows how to do it, please, please, please contact me!

PS. Contact me directly so the linuxsa list doesn't get clogged up with
non-linux mail.

Thanks
