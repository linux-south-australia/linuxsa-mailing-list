&gt; &gt; 9pm on, 31st may, 7 beaconsfield tce ascot park, it's byo - but over
&gt; &gt; 250
&gt; &gt; ppl have been invited so far.... no idea how many will turn up :)
&gt; 
&gt; LinuxSA meeting, Sat 31 May, 7:00 pm is the LinuxSA meeting....
&gt; I guess there is still after.... :)


yeah - but it's my b'day - so i'll be there - even if we don't get the
machine finished.... maybe it could be an on-going thing...


setting up a linux box as a server....

one month we do basic install and net config
next we do mail server/list server
finally www/ftp/proxy/name server

this wont be a specific presentation - rather and all in...

everyone has different ways of setting things up - so we could have a
general discussion of why each method is good.... do the one we work out is
best and go from there.....people who don't know much about it will
watch/listen/learn/throw in hair-brained ideas that might work, those of us
who know sumthing about it can tell people how we do it... and why we do it
that way.....

i'll bring this machine along on saturday - with the aim of getting linux
installed and the networking set-up

i missed the install fest - but maybe we could all have a discussion about
which is the best version of linux for what services... eg the box at home
is..... the server is...... don't use this one... etc etc
