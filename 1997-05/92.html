Hi ya all...

&gt; Guy standing at a podium:
&gt;   Welcome to the "Scientist anti-defamation league" weekly meeting.
&gt;   Tonight's topic is the stereotype that we scientists have no social lives...
&gt;   But first...
&gt;   Is Saturday night okay for our next meeting?
&gt; Audience:
&gt;   I'm free...
&gt;   No problem...
&gt;   Wide open...
:-)

I just thought I would add my two cents on the topic of meeting times.
The idea of Saturday evening meetings will almost certainly rule out
a large number of people. Most enjoy going out on a Saturday night and
not to computer related social gatherings, and those who don't are at
home watching The Bill and Roy & H.G. :)

Although now that I think about it, these meetings are few and far
between so the occasional Saturday evening should not really pose a
problem, and anyway I have a VCR. :)

None the less maybe the survey should be done again and limited to
weekend times, because of the location restrictions, eg


Please tick, circle, or otherwise highlight the most appropiate comment.

Saturday Morning - Sport commitments
                 - Sleeping off last night commitments
                 - Yeah right! :)
                 - I'm Free!

Saturday Arvo    - Family commitments
                 - Sport commitments
                 - Still sleeping off last night commitments
                 - Shopping commitments
                 - I'm Free!
 
Saturday Evening - Party on!
                 - Sport commitments (8 ball at Breakers)
                 - TV commitments
                 - I'm Free!

Sunday Morning   - Religious commitments
                 - Day of rest, and I ain't getting up for anyone
                 - Family commitments
                 - I'm Free!

Sunday Arvo      - Religious commitments
                 - Family commitments
                 - Still rest'n here!
                 - I'm Free!

Just my two cents, rounded down to nothing... Doh!
