Thanx to all who replied. With you help, Some reading and lots and lots of
trying I got it to work.

If u bother to find out what was happening, read on. This is my opinion only
tho.

It turned out that:
gpm likes my mouse as Logitech, (if M$ it want it to be unplugged andplugged
back in)
X likes it as MS, (if MouseMan wants it to be unplugged and ...)
And if gmp and X set to same mouse type they stuff each other up after i
start X and after exit X and needed to unplug it and plug it back in. That is
both we same type.

And mouseconfig only sets them both to same type, even if u reply no to
question to update X config for mouse. Or maybe I am missing something.

I just eidited file "/etc/sysconfig/mouse"
 MOUSETYPE="MouseMan"
 XMOUSETYPE="Microsoft"
 ...

and XF86Config
...
Protocol = "Microsoft"
...
end everything works now. But this is strage! On RH5.0 all worked as Logitech
fine.

*shrugs*

Thank you all.
Eugene

ps
as for questoin on Video card setup that I asked before...
When It went to testing my Video, the window that u have to click on was out
of the screen (low res) and I had to move mouse to see it. But since mouse
was not working ... I never sow the question, never replied to and test prog
assumed it didn't work :)
