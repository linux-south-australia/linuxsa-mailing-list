Hmmm... unfortunately, I don't have neither the confidence nor the
knowledge to attempt these... We do have tape backups, but I don't know
if it's the entire disk or not, and I wouldn't have a clue how to get
the data back onto the disk if the kernel died after relinking with
support for zip or whatever... and besides, it's an old SCO distro, and
we don't have the disks anywhere -- they seem to have walked...

We haven't tried NFS, but assumed it would have the same problem as ftp,
because the problem appears to be the ethernet card causing errors...

PLIP I know nothing about...

Telepathy works from SCO to my mind, but I can't get Win to pick up the
signals I'm sending it... :)

Floppys are a possibility, but damned slow, when you're talking about
60Mb of data... although, maybe we should check its size after a tar and
compress... then we'd need to make floppy sized files (tar can do this,
right?) and do the reverse on RedHat (Win doesn't like this kind of
thing, right?) and then ftp from RH to Win... what a mess...

&gt; 
&gt; Floppy disks?  Zip disk?
&gt; 
&gt; Telepathy module?
&gt; 
&gt; NFS?
&gt; 
&gt; PLIP is fast..
&gt; 
&gt; ?
