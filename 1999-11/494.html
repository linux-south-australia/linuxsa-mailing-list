Not directly Linux-related, but it's quite likely to be a problem shared
by SCO and Linux...

I'm helping a Unix virgin friend to move some data from an old, dying
SCO box and a new, dying Win NT box (going from bad to worse, but that's
what the customer wants...)

We messed around for two hours, trying to network the two, and failed
due to a dicky network card in the NT box. However, there was a Win98
box nearby, which we were able to connect to the SCO box successfully...
We could ping, telnet, ftp, and so on, to our heart's content... So we
set about trying to ftp this 45Mb of data across... It seemed to work
OK, as long as the file size was under (about) 2K -- or one hash mark...
Even large directory listings would simply stop at around this point...
Small files and short directory listings worked perfectly...

I thought that maybe the ftpd on the SCO box was being unco-operative,
so I tried a local ftp, and that worked perfectly with all file sizes.
So we thought that maybe the Windows ftp client (the standard command
line one) was getting confused for some reason. We tried the IE4 ftp
client, and that had exactly the same problem... Bah! We would have
tried another ftp client, but we didn't have one handy, and it was well
past my bed time...

Anyway, the question is: has anyone experienced this kind of problem
before? What can be done about it? Hopefully it's something really
simple and obvious, so I get all embarrassed, but can explain how to fix
it over the phone... :)

SCO information: SysV3.2 based... possibly SCO 2.2 (although that could
have been the version of the software -- I didn't check it myself...)
Running on an Acer PC, with Ethernet (10MBit, IIRC) using a cat5
crossover cable to link directly to the PC (which was running 98) I can
find out other details if need be...

Thanks in advance!
