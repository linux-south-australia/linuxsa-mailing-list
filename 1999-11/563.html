&gt; "years of experience" is, in my opinion, an overrated metric.
&gt; It can be a wide range so the person has seen many things,
&gt; or it can be one year many times over.

What could we reasonably use instead?
Self analysis holds little weight (ie. novice, intermediate, advanced, expert)

WHEN the skills where gained and last used helps. For example, I have 2-3
years
in HPUX 10.x admin but I haven't touched a HP box for 2 years.
I would say that someone who has only 1-2 years experience, gained over the
last 1-2 years, would be better suited if those skills were needed.

What else could we use to gauge a person's skills in a résumé?

I am really interested in what the group has to offer on this.  I am nearly
finished building an agency-free IT jobs web site that uses the
'experience and last used' scenario to gauge your skills.

I would be interested in other suggestions on ways to make this better.

&gt; Interviews are a problem though - it's really hard to get a grip  on
&gt; what someone is like and how much their resume lies in that short
&gt; time...

We've all seen the buzzword kings/queens at work in an interview.  I
always try to give them a problem to solve with as little information
as possible.
(ie. you have a unix box that seems to be running slow, what's wrong?).

A GOOD admin/tech will immediately ask you 10 questions.
An AVERAGE admin/tech will take you through the process of elimination.
A POOR admin/tech will tell you what the problem is, with heaps of buzzwords.

It generally works OK for me, but one so-and-so always slips through ....;)

I would also be interested in interview tricks other people use to show up the
exaggerators.

 --- 10 Ways to have fun with your Recruitment Agent ---

 1. Tell them you are a senior programmer looking for Y2K/GST/ecommerce
work, and
then hang up before they can get your details.
 2. Insist they negotiate better coffee for you with their client.
 3. Invite 20 friends to their Contractor's Christmas drinks.
 4. Bring your lawyer, accountant and rabbi to the signing of contracts.
 5. Send them your résumé via fat-a-gram.
 6. Invoice them individually for each hour worked.
 7. Call them at home at 2:30am to say you just took a support call
    and you would like to check on the after hours rate in your contract.
 8. Forget to tell them your working visa ran out 2 weeks ago.
 9. Call them at 10:30am on your first day and tell them it's not working out.
10. Register with www.techstreet.com.au and never talk to them again.
