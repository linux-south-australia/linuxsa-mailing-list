&gt; But those things you were looking at _were_ block/char device nodes.

But they were supposed to be files, and once were.  They were living in
his squid cache with squid cache names.

&gt; Surely "rm" will get rid of the files (as root).

But it didn't - as per his original message.

&gt; If not, then maybe "fsck" could fix it.

Which it didn't, also as per his original message.

&gt; "mkfs" is a bit drastic.

Had he been an "adept" user, he could have used debugfs to fix the
problem (I've had to do this on a corrupt FS before - inodes reporting
that they're character devices taking up space larger than the disk
itself, and this was after fsck was done with them - no amount of
rm'ing would remove these files).  However, unless you _really_ know
what you're doing, mkfs was the safest solution for him.
