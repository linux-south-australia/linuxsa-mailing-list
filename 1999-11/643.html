Mike, two points......

1) I was not being condescending....I was actually making a valid
comment abt the functionality of RH vs other distro's based on my
experiences with 4 installs of RH distro's 

2) If the term newbie offends YOU then please delete it and insert
"entry level users". I meant no offence by it & most ppl would not have
taken any. I refer you to YOUR URL and in particular this page
<A HREF="http://users.nf/linux/newbies.htm">http://users.nf/linux/newbies.htm</A> which in part reads "...NEWBIES
.....Like hacker, NOT a derogatory term...............Flame anyone and
your status moves from newbie to toast."

3) If you have nothing better to do than send sarcastic flames, then I
suggest you again browse to YOUR URL , and in particular this page 
<A HREF="http://users.nf/linux/newpage7.htm">http://users.nf/linux/newpage7.htm</A>  and thoroughly read and comprehend
it! This page deals with FLAMING!!

It would seem that you have not read the various pages for the URL given
in your email signature and are therefore NOT acquainted with acceptable
behaviour!!

&gt; &gt; Hi - Seriously, I hate RedHat ;)
&gt; 
&gt; oh no, wait for it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have never had a glitch-free RH
&gt; &gt; distro - the installs are fine but then there have always been numerous
&gt; &gt; probs with incomplete packages etc etc etc. If you want to spend the
&gt; &gt; MOST WORTHWHILE $56(approx) then I suggest you get SuSE-6.2
&gt; 
&gt; aaaaah there went "my favorite plug"
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;from
&gt; &gt; wherever (I got mine from netcraft) - For the $56 you get 6 CD's & a 450
&gt; &gt; Page Book!!!!! Far better value than M$-RedHat ;) and so far I have only
&gt; &gt; found 2 very minor glitches with it.
&gt; &gt; My 2 cents worth!
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't have paid 1c.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Phil
&gt; &gt; PS: I do agree though, that the Linux Pocketbook is quite worthwhile for
&gt; &gt; newbies!!
&gt; 
&gt; how condescendingly nice of you. Presumably if
&gt; you'd paid your $19.95 you *might* have troubled yourself to install
&gt; Caldera, which is based on your precious Suse distro. But then, only
&gt; newbies would know that.
