&gt; If I were to bring my Linux box to the meeting
&gt; 
&gt; - would I need all the peripherals?

Bring as much as you can to ensure that your system will operate, unfortunately
we can't guarantee that we will have any sort of equipment available that will
be compatible with your system.  

I know it is a pain, but it is pretty much the only way that we can 
guarantee that the system will work with your peripherals at home.
This begins to become really important when dealing with things like X11,
where we can easily set up a machine to destroy a monitor.

&gt; - would someone be able to give it the once over for SAMBA for NT
&gt; connection?

I am sure there will be plenty of people who will be willing to give you 
plenty of advice.

&gt; - can I mention ( or would you ) - If I am able to get the Genei Society to
&gt; install Linux as a WWW server etc would a member(s) volunteer to assist if
&gt; necessary?

Most likely.  I am sure there are enough people who you can trust to do a 
good job.  BTW what is the Genei Society?

Regards,

Matt
