&gt; A friend of mine manages a community radio station in Mt Gambier. He
&gt; would like to investigate using Linux to produce the stations " to feed
&gt; ". They are currently using a product that runs on OS2 Warp. Crashes at
&gt; least 5 times / day. Worse than NT if that be possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of any broadcasting software generated for Linux ?

If I understand this application properly, it is the one that a radio
station will use to synchronise the different digitised ads, promos, songs
and other sound snippets for transmission.

This sort of vertical market is where Open Source is going to really to
take hold IMHO.  It may take time for these companies to start thinking
that they can sink their money into a number of Open Source developers
who can both build applications for them, they have full access to the 
application and can do what they want.  I don't know what the prices would
be, but I would imagine that these systems wouldn't be cheap.

I have heard about a professional mixing system being developed by San
Mehat of VALinux fame (who also was lead engineer of the Corel Netwinder
project).  I will try to dig up some details.

As far as any existing applications, I don't know.  But there might be
some Community stations in the US that have some sort of systems.

Regards,

Matthew
