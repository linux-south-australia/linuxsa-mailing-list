&gt; The problem: I can't see everything properly (not my eyesight)
&gt; eg. the words don't come up on the menus. Sometimes they will if I run
&gt; the mouse over them. Also in a terminal window, I can only see text some
&gt; of the time. This also makes it hard to edit the XFree86Config file in
&gt; /etc/X11.

I had the very same problem with a SiS6326.  I don't like SiS6326's.
They're onboard and onboard = bad IMHO.

Anyway - I fixed the problem by adding a line to the XF86Config file..
something about option = NOACCEL or similar - it is all very (very) well
documented on the XFree86 web site.  I think that's www.xfree86.org or
something..  have a browse around there.  I was suprised at how helpful it
was, and how specific the information is.

I also have a similar problem with my S3 ViRGE..  it's a relatively cheap
and nasty video card..  I think the problem has to do with video memory,
and/or acceleration features.

&gt; Is there a way of rebooting without starting X so I can use pico or vi?
&gt; if so, Can anyone suggest different setting I could try, like the bit
depth
&gt; or resolution?  I would appreciate anyones help

Sounds like you need to change your runlevel.

LinuxSA: How can you do that without a readable prompt?  Can you do it at
the LILO: prompt?
