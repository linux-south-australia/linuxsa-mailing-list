&gt; Anyone got a suggestion for the modem and Live cards (I hate silence)?

For the SB Live:
go to <A HREF="http://opensource.creative.com/">http://opensource.creative.com/</A> and get the source code for the driver
from there.

It's simple to get working. All you do is untar the source, go into the
emu10k1 directory, type "make", and wait for it to complie (you have a
similar machine to me, so it's probably take about 2 to 3 minutes). copy
emu10k1.o to /lib/modules/2.2.10/misc then edit /etc/conf.modules to incude
"alias sound emu10k1". (then do a modprobe sound)

BTW, if your kernel includes "module version information", you'll get
unresolved symbols on your module. All you do if go to the emu10k1 source,
edit the Makefile, and on the 3rd (?) line, there's a line something similar
to "MODVERSIONS = n". Change the n to a y, then recompile, copy it to your
modules directory, then it'll work, no problem :)

BTW, the source for the driver gets changed multiple times a day, usually.
You can get the latest source at the time by CVS (it says how on their web
site). It's easier in my opinion to just get the tarball they have, which is
made normally more than once a week, and includes the date it was made in
the filename.

No idea about the modem sorry. It's not a winmodem is it?

Good luck,
Andy
