Jake,

My little set of bookmarks for linux with PDAs is at:

<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/palm.html">http://www.topology.org/palm.html</A>
for Palm organizers, and

<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/hpc.html">http://www.topology.org/hpc.html</A>
for handheld PCs.

For IrDA, I've just put together some bookmarks at:
<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/laptop.html">http://www.topology.org/laptop.html</A>

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. There's supposed to be IrDA support in the
kernel after 2.2.x. But my SuSE distribution
with 2.2.10 doesn't seem to have the irda utils and
things that are supposed to go with it.
I think you're supposed to download it and install it.
Anyway, I'll find out when I get my laptop.

PPS. Concerning the laptop query I made about 16 hours
back, thanks for the responses.
Now I'm going to go out and get the second
hand Toshiba Satellite Pro 480CDT, since
everyone says such good things about it running
on linux.
I had a good recommendation for the Mega-Image,
but although a dealer told me it's been
around for 4 years, there's no mention of it
in the linux compatibility lists.
So I'm avoiding that, although the specs are very good.
Equally, I'm avoiding the Toshiba 2590CDT, because
it's supposed to be tricky for getting the video
card going under linux or something.
