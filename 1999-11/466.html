&gt; Greetings all
&gt; 
&gt; I've recently taken over administration of a box running redhat 6.0
&gt; 
&gt; It seems the silly person has installed almost everything, including
&gt; Xwindows (stupid considering its a telehoused box) except a c compiler.

Why is this silly? Running GUI stuff off a server, although not always
the done thing, is quite useful, and a heap of fun!

The fact that you have the choice is what is so cool about X.

Don't forget to think about X's client/server model before you tell me
there is no monitor on the box!!  :o)

By the way, on a side note, it's "X" or "The X Window System". Not "X
windows". I'm sure there was a FAQ about this somewhere but I can't
turn it up. Sort of like the .au file with linus explaining how to
pronounce linux. Anyone have any idea where I might find it?

&gt; I get this error
&gt; 
&gt; creating cache ./config.cache
&gt; checking for gcc... gcc
&gt; checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) works... no
&gt; configure: error: installation or configuration problem: C compiler cannot
&gt; create executables.
&gt; 
&gt; my problem is, Im not sure what rpm I should grap and install on it

What I usually do if I can't locate the rpm a file should be in
(happens a lot) is an `rpm -qilp *.rpm &gt; rpmlist` from within the RPMS
directory of a redhat CD. Then you can search through `rpmlist` for
the file you need.

Anyway, an `rpm -qf /usr/bin/gcc` on a redhat 6.1 system tells me that
the package you need is egcs-1.1.2-24

&gt; could someone give me the exact name of the rpm so I can upload it and
&gt; install it?

In 6.0 the file is called
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.netcraft.com.au/pub/redhat/redhat-6.0/i386/RedHat/RPMS/egcs-1.1.2-12.i386.rpm">ftp://ftp.netcraft.com.au/pub/redhat/redhat-6.0/i386/RedHat/RPMS/egcs-1.1.2-12.i386.rpm</A>

Cheers

Alex!
