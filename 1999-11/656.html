<H1>SCO problems again</H1>

Still going on my SCO problem... (transferring 60Mb of data from SCO to
NT)

This time, I brought my RedHat 6.1 box down, and played games with MTU.
I dropped the MTU to 750, 250, and then 100, when the SCO box spat the
dummy and crashed. No matter what I did, FTP still wouldn't work (this
time I was using the RedHat box as client, so I know the problem is with
the SCO box somewhere, and have been tipped off that it would be the
3Com network card or its driver). I ran tcpdump on the RH box, and it
told me nothing of interest (due to my great foresight, I didn't capture
a log of its output... :(   )

Next thing was to change the network card over -- I put my PCI NE2000
compatible in, configured it, and then it wanted to relink the kernel...
At this stage, my lack of knowledge of SCO caused me to stop, as I
didn't know how to back out of this change later if the kernel failed to
boot. I'd guess there is a LILO equivalent, but I have no idea where to
find info on it... 

The next thing to try was mounting the SCO disk under Linux. Connected
fine, etc etc... ran `fdisk /dev/hdc`, and was told that the hdc4
partition was of `GNU HURD or SysV` type. Attempted mounting it. "bad
superblock" error. Did some doc hunting, and it seems that sysv fs
support is floppy only at this stage (even checked the latest 2.3.x
doco). 

The other options I can think of are a SLIP connection over a serial
cable that we don't have (and I know nothing about SLIP, or even if it
can be done from SCO to NT...), a PPP connection over a modem (14.4 K,
with over 60 Mb of data...), attempting a kernel relink and risking not
knowing how to back out, trying to do something with the tape drive I
know nothing about, or floppynet... Of course, there's always SCO
support, but my understanding is that the SCO licence is REALLY old, and
has gone walkabout, and there is no evidence of it existing...

Does anyone else have any ideas or suggestions, or is anyone else
interested in giving this a go? My friend's client would be willing to
pay for it...
