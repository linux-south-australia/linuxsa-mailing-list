Hello to all everyone on the Linux users group.

I have just subscribed to the Linux mailing list approximately four or five
days ago. I am a new user to Linux and I'm interested in learning a lot more
about it !!!

I own a business specialising in computer hardware reselling, and at this stage
we specialise working with the unreliable "Microsoft" products. I am an experience
Microsoft network administrator and have had a lot of experience with almost
every MS operating system and a lot of software packages. Because of this experiance
with the MS packages, I can tell, it is only a matter of time until something
worthwhile like Linux is due to take over !!

As a frustrated user of MS products I am ready to make the switch to Linux,
and I wish to eventually sell prebuilt Linux systems rather than MS Windows
systems.

I am asking if anyone on the Linux users group is able to assist in helping
me out with learning the Linux environment or have an tips on how to get familiar
with it faster so I can move my business and my clients away from MS and into
Linux.

If anyone can help me out, I'd be happy to hear from you ...

Regards
Jeremy Ervine
