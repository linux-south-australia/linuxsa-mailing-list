&gt; VMWARE for around $99 for the private use edition?

US$99, by credit card, from the web site at

 <A HREF="http://www.vmware.com/">http://www.vmware.com/</A>

[Aside: the rise in oil prices yesterday will have changed the
 US/AU exchange rate, so check before you buy.]

The web site doesn't give a good idea of the depth of the site license
discount.

&gt; VMWARE is more stable than running Windows by itself.

Only slightly, as the virtual machine doesn't have USB, IRDA, or other
devices that commonly have flaky device drivers.  As VMware grows in
features normal service will be resumed :-)  Win98 users might gain from
memory protection between VMs, but if you want stability you should be
running WinNT anyway.

VMware is certainly a lot more stable than software that trys to emulate
the Windows APIs.  Not that it is any less pitiful that Word is such a
complex product that you need to emulate an entire PC to run it.

Even Linux-only machines might find VMware useful.  Most real-world sites
need to run three environments: production, application test and systems
test.  For those with big-iron grunty servers, being able to run all three
on the same machine can save a lot of cash.  Solaris 8 comes with a
almost-VM for exactly this reason (you might want to remember that Linux
had this first the next time some management type starts throwing about
market-speak like `enterprise ready').
