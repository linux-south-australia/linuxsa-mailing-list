I don't know how old this news is, but I only just found out. Anyway some of
you may be interested to hear that Creative have open sourced their SB Live
drivers for linux (but the Win drivers remain binary only).

They have a web page at:
<A HREF="http://opensource.creative.com/">http://opensource.creative.com/</A>

They also have a source for their DXR2 board (however, the source was
donated, so it's not really their code).

There's also a SB Live under Linux FAQ, located at
<A HREF="http://opensource.creative.com/live_faq.html">http://opensource.creative.com/live_faq.html</A>

An interesting part (in my opinion) is:

Q.C2- What features will be supported?
For the Open Source drivers, most normal features that are normally
supported under Linux are already supported. Creative is working with
third-party developers on adding more advanced audio features to Linux such
as EAX.


Anyway, to all the gamers out there, hopefully they'll get 4 speaker and EAX
working, and maybe the other 3D audio chip will get linux drivers (if it
doesn't already. also, I can't remember the name of the chip, or the company
that makes it. sorry!).

I havn't tried compiling the driver myself yet (i only stumbled across this
information 2 minutes ago), but I'll try it Real Soon Now. I won't post my
success/failure unless people want me to, but I think it would be safe to
assume that the source works, since the beta binaries have been around for
quite some time.

I'll finish off my my own opinion: I don't care if the drivers are open
source or not, but as long as they work and give all the features of the
sound card (which it currently does not). The Beta drivers have been around
for a while, and have made (almost) no progress since their first release. I
hope that by open souring the driver, work will get done quickly, and we can
finally use some of the extra featuers of the sound card!

bye,
Andy
