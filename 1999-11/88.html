Hi, 

got no trouble accepting what you say there. The thrust of my argument was to
point out the need to work from a good, major base, to begin with. ie Gnu C or
whatever. While it is unrealistic to expect an embedded compiler to implement
left_knee_over_toehold() glibc functions. It is very reasonable to expect it to
conform to the base standard library calls. The point behind the Gnu compiler
(or any other major dev, even Msoft)  is to use it as a Lint tool, NOT a
compiler. There is simply no way an always insignificant embedded compiler can
have the resources or development put into it to lint the code and discover
gotchas. My attitude which has held me in reasonable employment over the years
is that my code must first pass a (g)lint test. I'll twist the arms and legs
off the embedded compiler to make it conform to that.

The second issue is just how do you test embedded micros other than endlessly
burning eproms or buying special purpose debugger hardware. Both of which are
unrealistic in the short life cycle of a given micro. HC11F1? what's that! Far
better to use a mainstream compiler to test the 80% of code always present that
has nothing to do with i/o.

&gt; I have found some rather good debugging utils for the HC11... some of which
&gt; are quite new and are still being developed.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeh... at TAFE they teach HC11 programming using the hitech C compiler and
&gt; the old DOS IDE (they dont have the money to upgrade to the windows ver).
&gt; Its funny, after playing with the ported GCC a bit, ive found that Hitech's
&gt; C compiler is an absolute load of bollocks, even though it is considered to
&gt; be one of the best compilers around.
&gt; The GCC port for the HC11 by Stephane Carrez
&gt; (<A HREF="http://home.worldnet.fr/stcarrez/m68hc11_port.html">http://home.worldnet.fr/stcarrez/m68hc11_port.html</A>) is sooo much better
&gt; than Hitech's compiler. Its optimisation is a lot better, and all the code
&gt; is PROPPER ANSI C.
