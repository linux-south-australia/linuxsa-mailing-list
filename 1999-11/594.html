&gt; Hi there!
&gt;
&gt; Is there any way to force X to redraw the various windows on screen more
&gt; often than the default? What I would like is for X to interrupt the
&gt; program, force it to redraw itself and then continue. What happens at
&gt; the moment is that a program (such as StarOffice which is the classic
&gt; example, or kMail) starts doing something which takes a long time but
&gt; fails to redraw. Hence, it's difficult to determine if the program has
&gt; crashed or is actually doing something but hasn't redrawn....

yes. kmail is the classic example, and it is all to do with threading.
Specifically the lack of them. No matter
how many times you bash X to re-display, it is up to the programs
themselves
to find time slices to do it.

kmail and anything else K uses QT version 1 libs. The support for
threading
(doing lotsa different things in separate
processes) is not quite there. QT version 2 is, and is what KDE version
2 is
using. (in beta, and not ready yet). Kmail has been specifically
targeted.

But a warning. The fact that qt2 supplies the necessaries, and the fact
that
kde will account for that, still leaves
individual holes to be filled where the applications themselves must
also be
re-written.

(sorry i couldn't post to your mail group, for whatever reason your
reply
address got in first, perhaps you could echo
it for me)
