&gt; I don't understand what offended you in Phil's comments.  I never had a
&gt; glitch free Red Hat install, either, although (naturally) I also never had
&gt; a serious problem installing it.  Come to think of it, I also never had a
&gt; glitch free Caldera, FreeBSD, or BSD/OS install.  (On reflection, I have
&gt; had glitch free BSD/OS installs.)  I think that says something about how
&gt; complicated, or perhaps shitty, Wintel hardware so often is.

I might just jump in here and quantify what David just said. I agree
that RedHat installs sometimes have problems, and I agree that most
OSs have some problems with installation. But I have consistantly
noticed that installations with problems almost always occur on shitty
hardware.

If you pay the extra dollars for the brandname hardware that redhat
even go to the trouble of listing on their site, you will almost
always have a trouble free install. I have probably only installed
RedHat 200 times or less this year, but that's still enough of a
sample to get a rough idea about what causes the problems. I could
list case after case of why I think this, but most people know that
you get what you pay for.

When your using an operating that actually utilizes the hardware to it
fullest, you will...

a) get better results with hardware that isn't cheap and nasty
b) be expected to know enough about the hardware to tell the OS about
   it. Auto detection is a compromise.

Cheers

Alex!
