Thank you to everyone who replied. I set up video ok now. But silly
mouse still giving me trouble. I read 3-buttonmouse-howto and XF86Config
manual.

Q1. How do I restart gmp (or gpm) so the changes take affect? I read man
pages and 3button-mouse-howto. It was good, but did not say how to
restart gmp.
Q2. Is there difference between "logitech" that X uses and "logitech"
for gmp?

The reason I am asking is:

When using mouse at the conlose with gmp (or gpm) Logitech protocol work
perfectly.
When I set mouse to "Microsoft" it does not work straigt away. I have to
unplug it and plug it back or do "echo '*n' &gt; /dev/mouse" and then it
works.

It never workx in X11!!! In pointer sections of /etc/XF*Config I tried
all types that had any luck at the console:
Microsoft
MouseMan
Logitech
but all are stuffed! I need to unplug it and plug it back in for it to
work with X for any of those protocols. What is even more rediculos,
when I quit X I have to do same again for it to work at the console
again! Grrrrr

Its a Mitsumi mouse but seems to work best when I use it as "logitech".
When I had RH5.0, I'd just run 'mouseconfig' and chose new type and
mouse behavior would change, but now with RH6.0 I can't do that! I
rebooted to fix the mouse!!!

Thank you.

Eugene
