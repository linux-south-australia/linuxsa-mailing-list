This is getting far away from Linux, oh well...

&gt; In any case everyone cheats like hell, atomic clocks are sped up and slowed

&gt; folks, it is possible to travel thru time. Such is the craziness of humankind
&gt; that we have men in little white overcoats who spend their waking hours
&gt; counting ticks on the atomic clock so that they can untick it by one when they
&gt; think its a 'good idea'. Now, what was that song about counting holes in
&gt; Lancashire?

For more on a proposal how big wobbles might generate catastrophes 
that might inspire people to believe in supernatural powers, try 
Ockham's Razor:

            Geology and God, Part One
            <A HREF="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ockham/stories/s61699.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ockham/stories/s61699.htm</A>
            Broadcast date: 24/10/99 
            In this talk Dr. Peter James proposes that the concept of a god 
            arose out of witnessing major catastrophes. This is part one of 
            a two part talk.


&gt; Even Xmas day is technically wrong, i don't remember the actual
&gt; number (think Jan 3rd).

And for some discussion on things like solstices and Christmas day, 
including an explanation of the choice of December 25th, try the second 
part of the talk:

            Geology and God, Part Two
            <A HREF="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ockham/stories/s63018.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ockham/stories/s63018.htm</A>
            Broadcast date: 31/10/99 
            This week, in part two of this two-part talk Dr. Peter James 
            tries to explain the growth and character of some religions.
              
cheers,
