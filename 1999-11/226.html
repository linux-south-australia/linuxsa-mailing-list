Unfortunate choice.  There's no point in including web content unless you
know (or are relatively certain) that the browsers that will retrieve it
know how to decode it.  I suspect most browsers have inbuilt support for
GIF, JPEG is slightly less available (I have personally used an old browser
that could grok GIF but not JPEG) but PNG is going to be really dull.
Maybe the latest range of browsers all support PNG, so if you want to
exclude everyone with a browser older than x hours (where x is the age of
"the latest range", then by all means you simply must save all of your
images as PNG.  On the other hand, if what you really want is to maximise
your viewing audience, you should:

1. Use no frames;
2. Use no JavaScript;
3. Use no applets;
4. Use no style sheets;
5. Use no Front Page extensions;
6. Use no active content;
7. Use no audio;
8. Use no video;
9. Use as few pictures as possible; and
10.Use no picture format other than GIF (and maybe JPEG).

Use of tables will result in some browsers displaying your content badly,
but I personally think this is acceptable.  It is very difficult to format
content, other than very simple pages, without using tables.  For example,
those nifty menus down the left are all done with tables.

While I'm sharing words of wisdom, don't use a black background, it's the
number one fault of the suckiest web page faults.  Professional graphic
artists have earned the right to use black backgrounds; for most everyone
else it just looks tasteless.  Don't send text as graphics.  If you want to
send text, send text; if it's a picture, make sure it says a thousand
words.  Sending text as graphics just makes your page take longer to load.
Assume that your page is going to be sent over a slow modem, and that your
average viewer is going to get bored if your page is displayed in more than
30 seconds.  Your page, including all content, should be less than 50KB,
and the smaller the better.  Maybe you can cheat by guiding using content
that you know will be cached from other pages.  You can leave your cutsie
background out of size calculations for all pages after the first one.

If you are interested in bad web page design I highly recommend Vincent
Flanders' "Web Pages That Suck.com" (<A HREF="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com.">http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com.</A>)
