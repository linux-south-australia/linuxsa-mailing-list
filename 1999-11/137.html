Hi all.

I currently use Gnome and Enlightenment as my window manager/desktop
configuration.  I have found it to be a fantastic combination, and it does
everything that I need.  I use a few programs that call the "play" command
to play wav files when events occur.  The problem is that the play command
is not ESD aware, and refuses to play sounds because ESD has locked the
port.  Fair enough I guess.  I tried using the command "esddsp play
wavefile.wav" but play still reports that the port is locked.

I have looked at the ESD website, and tried to download a program to play
wavs from there, but on numerous occasions I get errors that servers have no
IP address.

Are there any programs out there that have similar command-line
functionality to the play command, but are esd aware?

On another note, when I am playing MP3's or particularly long PCM audio
files (using ESD, and not) the sound goes all burbly if I try and move or
resize a window in X, and when using XMMS to play MP3s every time it reads
from the hard disk or CDROM to refresh its cache, the sound goes all burbly
while the read it occurring. Basically, any activity at all on the system
causes the sound to get currupted.  I will stress that it doesn't stop or
break up at all, just goes all garbled and horrible.

I only noticed the problem after upgrading from RedHat 5.0 to 5.2.  I have
now done a fresh install of RH6.0 on a brand new 18.2G HDD (oh the joys of
making this work under Windows, and still have Linux partitions on it...),
and the problem still exists.

Thanks in advance,
Adam
