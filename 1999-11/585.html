lo all,
After upgrading my brothers machine, I now have for sale on his behalf
an i430VX motherboard with a Cyrix 200L CPU, and 16Mb of 72pin ram and a
1mb S3 PCI video card.
I am willing to sell the memory and video card seperately, but the cpu
and motherboard will stay together.
The memory is fastpage type.
The video card worked in X windows.
The motherboard and CPU has been in his machine for ages and has always
worked fine. Cyrix CPUs are pretty slow at floating-point math by
comparision to intel and amd cpus, but reasonably quick at integer type
stuff. They're great for running little linux boxes somewhere to server
stuff, since that sort of thing barely touches the floating point unit
at all. It's not exactly a supercomputer, but it's cheap n decent.

Let me know by private email if you're interested in anything.

Toby
