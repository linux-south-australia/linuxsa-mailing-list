I forwarded Matthew Tippet's Email about daylight savings to a friend
of mine who'd just finished a perpetual calendar program on another
platform, and he had a couple comments he asked to pass along.  His
comments are below:

Let me quote Matt's major statement:

&gt;     "The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred in 1752 on
&gt; the 3rd of September.  By this time, most countries had recognized the
&gt; reformation (although a few did not recognize it until the early
&gt; 1900's.)  

&gt; Ten days following that date were eliminated by the reformation, so
&gt; the calendar for that month is a bit unusual." 

First fact: The Gregorian Calendar Reformation has been established by
Pope Gregor XIII who lived from 1502 to 1585, he was Pope since 1572. He
reformed the Julian calendar in 1582, ordering 10 days to leave off from
October 1582 (the days from Oct 4 to Oct 15, 1582)! This way the flow of
the weekdays didn't break. There's *no other date to be correct* since
this is the *original* order of Pope Gregor!

Second fact (and I mentioned it in my article): Most catholic states in
the world immediately obeyed the order of the pope, and changed their
calendar accordingly. Most protestant states *didn't*! They followed
*much* later (200 years and even later)! Now to Matt's mail: The year
1752 was the year *Great Britain* changed its calendar! 170 years too
late! So, UNIX's man on CAL depends on exactly this date when the UK
decided to change their calendar! It intercepts the true originator of
the calendar reformation!

Could you inform Matthew?

Cheers

Arndt
