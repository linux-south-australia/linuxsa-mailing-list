&gt; I checked out your page and found that netscape would not display
&gt; the   .png but i.i.e.. would. it seems that netscape does not recognize
&gt; it as an image.

&gt;I just looked at the page using IE 5 and the top left ALP banner is &gt;there
&gt;and looks beautiful.

&gt;IE5 supports png.

&gt;Perhaps the other browsers don't?

&gt;Hi again - re my previous post - since clicking on & saving, the
&gt;"missing link pic" I can now view the entire page complete with the &gt;png.
&gt;So, I guess netscape 4.61 can see png's...doesnt solve the mystery of
&gt;why it doesnt show on the page initially though!?!?!?!

&gt;Well, trying to retrieve the image direct from the server produces
&gt;("<A HREF="http://homepages.picknowl.com.au/alphart/alp.png">http://homepages.picknowl.com.au/alphart/alp.png</A>") produces a
&gt;404 File not found error.  Are you _sure_ that the image file
&gt;exists in the same directory as the default.htm and is named
&gt;correctly?

&gt;Regards,
&gt;  Daryl Tester

...and Bruce concludes...
1. the file is there, but it isn't.
2. netscape can see the file, but it can't.
3. IE can't seem to figure out what the problem is.
4. depending on your political bent, the image might or might not look
good...
5. and Bruce hasn't got a clue what the problem is, but he is stunned
and very grateful for the masses of assistance.

Because of the 404 that Darryl found, I will try some variations in file
name, i.e. change case to all upper, first char only upper etc. Hey,
clutching at straws, I know, but nothing else works.

Let you know...

Bruce
