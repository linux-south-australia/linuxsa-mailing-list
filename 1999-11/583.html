D'day everyone

I just installed RH6.0 and can't get X windows to work. It detected my
VideoCard ok. (Tseng Labs) Chose resulution and went to test X and stoped
there with a black screen. Monitor has an LCD and says it's getting
signal, correct resolutions and frequency (as I selected) but screen is
back and no action. Once it came out of it with an error. I tried to chose
different settings and it never comes out of it again. CTRL+ALT+DEL was my
solution. I could not reproduce the error and can't remember it.
With RH5.0 it got detected and worked 10/10 times every and any install on
resolution!

Mouse does not work either. I am using mouseconfig to select a mouse type
and I tried them all now. It's 6 year old Mitsumi mouse. with RH5.0 mouse
worked fine with Logitech and worked somehow with M$. Now it does not wotk
at all. When I move it occasionaly jumps in random directions, but usualy
does nothing. I tried connecting M$ mouse, but same story.

Here comes part where I need to give you more info. I am sill new so tell
me what info I need to supply and how to get it, pleeaaaase!

Thank you in advance.

Eugene



ps. Maybe I should go back to RH5.0 :)
