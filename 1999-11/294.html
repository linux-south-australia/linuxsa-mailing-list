Thanks Gaelyne for your very detailed response.

I perhaps should have been a bit more precise in my question. There are
plenty of VT100 terminals for TRS80's and I imagine doing a terminal connect
to a Linux box would be quite straightforward, although it looks like from
your response that someone has really ironed out the wrinkles. I also found
plenty of stuff on the net about TRS80 emulators for Linux but what I as
really interested in was whether I could store the TRS80 software on a Linux
box and suck it down to the TRS80 and run it, and even store work files
there such as Script It files and Visicalc files (for those who can
remember).

&gt;  &gt; I seem to vaguely recall something a while ago on this list about
&gt; people
&gt;  &gt; hooking their C64's, or something similar, into Linux boxes.
&gt; 
&gt; It's quite possible, and thanks to this ability, development of PPP
&gt; for the C64 is coming along fairly well, I'm pleased to report.  :-)
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Does anyone know if this has been done using TRS80's (Model III's,
&gt; Model
&gt;  &gt; IV's and Model 16's in particular).
&gt; 
&gt; This is the info sheet I send to people interested in connectiong
&gt; their Commodore computers to a Linux box.  You'll need a null modem
&gt; and an ANSI or VT100 terminal program for the TRS80. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; Connecting the C64/128 to a Linux computer as a dumb terminal
&gt; 
&gt; I use a Turbo232 cartridge connected to the Linux computer via a null
&gt; modem connection.  Null modem adapters can be found at any Tandy's,
&gt; Radio Shack, or most computer stores. You may also need a gender changer
&gt; to connect it together if the plugs don't match.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: The following is a quick summary of the 'Linux Serial HOWTO',
&gt;       chapter 8 ("How Do I Set Up A Terminal Connected To My PC?")
&gt; 
&gt; Within Linux, as root, edit /etc/gettydefs
&gt; 
&gt; Find the lines near the top starting like:
&gt;   DT&lt;baudrate&gt;..........
&gt; 
&gt; Look for a line with DTxxxx where xxxx is the baud rate you want to use.
&gt; If one exists already, then skip down to editing /etc/inittab.
&gt; 
&gt; Copy one of the 'DT' entries (DT = Dumb Terminal) and ensure that ALL
&gt; the numbers (including the last one) are the same as the baud rate of
&gt; your C64/128 term program (EG, DT38400 or DT115200). You're just
&gt; making an appropriate config line for your terminal speed. If you use
&gt; hardware flow control, you will need to add the flag "CRTSCTS" to the
&gt; line. For example, the following is a 2400bps entry with h/w flow control:
&gt; DT2400# B2400 CS8 CLOCAL # B2400 SANE CRTSCTS CLOCAL #@S @B login: #DT2400
&gt;  Save the file. 
&gt; 
&gt; Edit /etc/inittab
&gt; Down near the bottom, you'll see a row of lines with the heading 
&gt; "# Run gettys in standard run levels" after the last one (probably
&gt; "6:2345:respawn...."), add one that looks like this: 
&gt; 
&gt; S1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty ttyS1 DT115200 vt100
&gt; 
&gt; This example is for Com Port 2. If your null-modem connection is using
&gt; Com Port one, change the line to "S0.........ttyS0...." or S2 and
&gt; ttyS2 for Com Port 3, etc.  
&gt; 
&gt; The "DT115200" text should be the same as your baud rate for your C=
&gt; term program. If you use 38400, change DT115200 to DT38400. The last part
&gt; (vt100) is the default terminal emulation. Save the file.
&gt; 
&gt; With the C= connected to the Linux computer via null modem run a VT100
&gt; term program such as Novaterm, Desterm or Dialogue, make sure it's at
&gt; the same baud rate as you've set in the /etc/inittab and
&gt; /etc/gettydefs files.
&gt; 
&gt; Type "/sbin/init q" on the server (to reset the inittab file), and
&gt; watch the 128's screen. You'll be prompted for a login name and then
&gt; password. Your C= is now connect to the Linux box as a dumb terminal!
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to be able to login as root from the C64/128 (via shell)
&gt; you'll have to add TTYS1 (or your serial port equivalent) to the
&gt; /etc/securetty file.
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; There's also a section on SLIP that I can send if it's needed.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Gaelyne
