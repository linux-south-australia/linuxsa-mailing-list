&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to access my mailbox on one of my Linux systems. I had installed
&gt; Qmail on it and later decided to move back to Sendmail. At first, all qmail
&gt; related material was deleted and later I went as far as reinstalling Linux.
&gt; The /home is on a different partition so the user data was secure. I use
&gt; ELM and MUTT. I have removed all references to Qmail from /home/users
&gt; directories.

Are you sure that you have deleted all the files??? Are there any files
like .procmail or .fetchrc in the home directories??

Try creating a new user and see if the mail for that user behaves, or if
it is still messing up.
 
&gt; I can't access any mail for the local user. The mailbox seems to get it,
&gt; but when I use mail, elm or mutt, it system seems to be looking in ~/Maildir,
&gt; which is a Qmail scheme of the mailbox. Please keep in mind this is a new
&gt; installation. 
&gt; 

For all users? Or just particular users? What about a new user? (added
after you removed QMail?

Cheers
Dazz
