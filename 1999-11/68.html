I am not sure what is motive in Australia, but in and Russia (where I am
from) among convinience resons for time savings, a good reason was power
saving. I think same would apply to any region. Exept a country covering
many timezones has an extra benefit from it by pushing unused power from
regions where it is night, to regions wher it is sill dayling and life is
still going. This is where standart time messes things up a bit.

If u are working during daylight u need less lights. Obvios.
Daylight changes and u need to start work later. So... who would want to
go and change all their signs on "we are open from xxxx to xxxx"?

Plus, ppl are so used to going to, say, work at 6am. You just change the
clock and everything falls into place.

I am not saying it is good solutions, but it is the best we have so far.

and if u top it up with all the resons already mentioned... I wouldn't
want a job or standadizing time... :)

And those who realy need such presision would user Grivinch time, or what
ever it is called nowdays, anyway. This keeps everyone happy. Kinda. :)

&gt; From a linux point of view, you COULD make a kernel that has everything
&gt; compiled into it, compiled without any 486 or better options, and then
&gt; everyone could use it....But would you want to?
&gt; We know that it's better to just have the features you need, compiled
&gt; for your particular processor.
&gt; The same goes for times, perhaps.
&gt; 
&gt; It's handy to know that no matter where you are in the world, it's
&gt; usually dark at 0000, and usually lunch time by 1200, for instance.
&gt; Imagine if you had to go and look up a guidebook just to find out what
&gt; hours your local shops were open at?
&gt; (Adelaide, eastern suburbs 1318.56 to 2148.56, and western suburbs
&gt; 1315.34 to 2145.34 for example)
