&gt; &gt; We've ditched the Hylafax Windows client, in favour of setting up a
&gt; &gt; Samba print queue on the box, and by modifying the lpr command in samba
&gt; &gt; to a custom built script, we can automagically send faxes via HylaFax,
&gt; 
&gt; Out of curiousity, how are you prompting the end user for the fax number?

Ahh, we aren't. The Faxes that we send via this are generated from templates and
client info in a database, so there is a tiny header line sent through on the first page,
which holds all the destination details, and how to send the item either via fax or
via Email'ed PDF's.


&gt; &gt; One small problem we did find though was the resolution or quality of
&gt; &gt; the outgoing faxes.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, the resolution isn't as great as your average laser or dot-matrix
&gt; (Mmmm, Dot Matrix) ...  Do you have it set up for incoming faxes as
&gt; well?

I think it's more the rastering of the printer driver, and even the software sending it, which
effects it. My colleuge has done some work in the past on HylaFax and said that it can be very picky
about the modem you use.  Or more importantly, you have to choose a modem , that complies strictly
with faxing standards to make sure you can send to all the Fax machines out there without a glitch.

And for now, we still use a real Paper (laser style) fax for incoming faxes.
*shrug* it works, and it's easier for the moment for the Sales people. :)
