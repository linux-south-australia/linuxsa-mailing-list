&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to setup a POP3 mail server and I am having a little trouble.
&gt; 
&gt; I found an article on the web that gave me instructions on downloading,
&gt; compliling and installing a POP3 server. I have done all of this but I am
&gt; unable to recieve any mail (I am able to send though).
Anymore info on the problem ? eg what errors are happening ?
Are you able to connect to the pop server ?

When you mean receive mail ? You mean check you mail using pop3 on the
server you mail comes in on , or you mean your mail server isnt receiving
incoming mail using a program like sendmail or qmail from the outside
world ?

&gt; 
&gt; I was talking to someone about it last week and they said because my
&gt; domain name (www.&lt;domain&gt; is visable though) was not visable on the web it
&gt; would not work. So if someone sends me am email at &lt;name&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;, the
&gt; &lt;domain&gt; part is not resolved to anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I do run my own name server but unfortunately I am running Windows NT.
&gt; Is there any type of record that has to be added (A, NS etc) so that my
&gt; domain name will be visable or is there something that I am forgetting to
&gt; do (which is most likely).
&gt; 
DNS can be tricky stuff,
NT dns manager doesnt add a default A record for domain.somthing @ ip,
It doesnt matter though if domain.somthing doesnt resolve, the record
your most probaly (guessing form the little information provided), is a MX
record so the outside world can find out which server is your email server
to send to for your domain.


eg	

	MX	10 mail-server-here

I suggest you go read up at,

<A HREF="http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/">http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/</A>

which contains various resoures on dns stuff.

If ya provide more information might be able to give a better answer =].
(May also have to add the domain you want to recieve mail on to your mail
smtp program configuration prorgam which in sendmail is sendmail.cw
nomrally located in /etc or /etc/mail).

Just remember not to get confused between your smtp mail program (the one
that send and recives email on your mail server(eg sendmail) to the
outside world, and pop3 for collecting your email from the mail server to
your mail reading program.

sorry for the long reply

Brad
