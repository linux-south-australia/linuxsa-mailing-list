Mike,

I don't understand what offended you in Phil's comments.  I never had a
glitch free Red Hat install, either, although (naturally) I also never had
a serious problem installing it.  Come to think of it, I also never had a
glitch free Caldera, FreeBSD, or BSD/OS install.  (On reflection, I have
had glitch free BSD/OS installs.)  I think that says something about how
complicated, or perhaps shitty, Wintel hardware so often is.  It certainly
says nothing deserving you to flame me, just as Phil didn't deserve, as far
as I can see, the flaming he got from you.

Do you really have a problem with somebody saying, "I like brand-x and at
$zz it is MOST WORTHWHILE"?

David
