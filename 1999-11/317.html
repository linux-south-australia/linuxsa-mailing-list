 &gt; It's gone! You're right. Netscape makes the "DNS harrasser" appear,
 &gt; and netscape exit implies "DNS hassler" exit.

Netscape uses the dns helper so that DNS lookups will occur asynchronously.
People who have used netscape since the early days of v1.0 will remember
that DNS lookups could take absolutely ages, and the browser's display
would essentially lock-up while they were occurring.  In Netscape v3.0
they introduced the "dns helper" process, spawned by netscape, which
communicates with the main netscape process over a socket.  Whenever the
browser wants to do a DNS lookup it communicates with the dns helper and
gets it to do it instead;  if any process is going to lock up, it'll
therefore be the helper instead of the browser's user interface.

 &gt; Hmmm. Well that's another theory into the bin!
 &gt; Maybe telnet creates it's own "helper" to feed incorrect
 &gt; IP addresses to it.

Telnet does nothing of the sort ("Use the source, Luke!").  Additionally,
the Netscape dns helper has nothing to do with incorrect addresses.

 &gt; So maybe the IP addresses are being cached in the IP layer of
 &gt; the kernel.

The IP layer of the kernel knows absolutely nothing whatsoever about
hostnames;  They exist purely and exclusively at the application layer.

 &gt; One way to test this would be to re-boot the PC.

No, that won't test that -- That'll do a whole lot of other things
too, which may have other side effects.  If your problem goes away
after a reboot you will not be able to conclude that the kernel was
caching something.

Restart your nameservers, as I suggested yesterday.  Nameservers
run their own caches.

 &gt; And there are some other things to do before actually
 &gt; reading telnet and kernel source.

The kernel is irrelevent.  And I'd strongly suggest that reading
telnet source would be a waste of time too.

 &gt; Very sneaky access to a Unix socket!!!
 &gt; This does not show up in tcpdump -i lo.
 &gt; socket(PF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)         = 3

That's because tcpdump doesn't know anything about sockets, ever.
tcpdump watches network packets on network interfaces at the 
network access layer.  Sockets are on the boundary between the 
Internet layer and the application layer.

Furthermore, this socket has nothing to do with a network anyway,
because it's a UNIX domain socket (PF_UNIX), so it's always local
to the machine.

You'll find it's communicating with a daemon called nscd, the
nameservice cache daemon.

 &gt; Another sneaky access to the same Unix socket!

It's not sneaky, Alan -- It's doing precisely what it's supposed to
do.  The resolver in libc (i.e.: the implementation of the routines
which do DNS lookups in the standard runtime library) does all this
whenever you ask to have a name resolved.

 &gt; Then opens /etc/nsswitch.conf.
 &gt; But shouldn't it have done this earlier?

Not necessarily.  If you start with a call to res_init() then use the
other routines in resolver(3) to construct your query, you'll bypass
nsswitch.conf by operating at a lower level.  nsswitch.conf is only
used by high-level routines like gethostbyname(), getpwnam(), etc.

 &gt; Does this libnss_db package have something to do with
 &gt; name service databases?

It's the name service switch - it's the bit that loads the shared
objects which implement lookups in the various name services listed
in nsswitch.conf

 &gt; Also opens libnss_files package.

One of the aforementioned shared objects.

 &gt; Also connected with name lookup?

Yes, due to the fact that "files" is listed as one of the ways to
obtain host information.
