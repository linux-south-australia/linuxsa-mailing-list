You weren't.  The additional information was for my benefit. :-)
 
&gt;&gt;     ls -l /usr/local/squid/cache/00/02/00000252

Hmmm.

&gt; What do b,c,t,T mean?

It means (most likely) that your inode is corrupted.  I've had this
happen on development box, coincidently enough, also with squid files.

&gt;&gt;     cat /usr/local/squid/cache/00/02/00000252 &gt; /dev/null

&gt; cat /usr/local/squid/cache/00/02/00000251 &gt;/dev/null
&gt; cat: /usr/local/squid/cache/00/02/00000251: No such device

Expected.

&gt;&gt;     rm /usr/local/squid/cache/00/02/00000252

&gt; rm /usr/local/squid/cache/00/02/00000251 
&gt; rm: remove `/usr/local/squid/cache/00/02/00000251'? y
&gt; rm: cannot unlink `/usr/local/squid/cache/00/02/00000251':
&gt; Operation not permitted

Also expected; these are the exact symptoms that I had.  From here,
you have two solutions that spring to mind.

1) Rebuild the filesystem of the hard disk (using mke2fs).  OK if
   your squid cache is on its own partition, a bummer if it isn't
   (which is what this one appears to be).
2) (* Danger, Will Robinson *) Use debugfs to modify / remove these
   inodes.  DOING SO WILL VOID ANY AND/OR ALL YOUR WARRANTIES THAT
   COME WITH YOUR LINUX DISTRIBUTION, may traumatise your cat beyond
   repair, cause the collapse of world peace, or at worse, corrupt
   your file system.

&gt; What should I do now?

Seriously, I haven't used debugfs before, and wouldn't recommend
it to people who aren't comfortable as to how the Unix filesystem
hangs together.  Backup what you can off that file system, then
rebuild it from scratch.  If this is a "production" squid setup,
consider putting the cache on its own partition, but only for the
reason of keeping a tight rein on its disk usage.  Squid is unlikely
(very) to have caused the corrupt inode in the first place.

Regards,
  Daryl Tester
