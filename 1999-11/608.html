Hi... couple of things.. 
1a) the Can't connect: error normally means the server is not running on
the machine you are trying to contact - using the -display option you
MUST have Xauth setup on the remote machine, or at the very least type
the following on the remote machine from within X)
xhost + (to allow all x connects) or xhost +ipnumber (for individual
addresses)
1b) you MUST specify a display - ie/  xterm -display 192.168.1.2:0  if
you leave off the ":0" it wont be able to connect.
2) To run vnc you MUST have extra fonts - font100 & fontscl (scalable) 
at least - else you will get errors such as you are experiencing.

Hope that helps.

Phil

&gt; Is anyone out there familiar with VNC?  It allows you to create virtual X
&gt; desktops that you can connect to from across a network.  Well, I did have
&gt; it working properly, then I reinstalled RedHat 6.0 on my system (for a
&gt; variety of other reasons).  Now, when I try to create the VNC X desktop, it
&gt; won't allow anything to exist on it.  What I mean, is that it would usually
&gt; create the desktop, and put an xterm in it as a default, but now, it just
&gt; creates the desktop.  It tries to put an xterm on it, but the xterm exists
&gt; out.  It seems that for some reason it can't connect to the virtual desktop.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to then start an xterm in the VNC desktop manually, using the
&gt; "-display" tag.  I got the following error:
&gt; 
&gt; _X11TransSocketINETConnect: Can't connect: errno = 111
&gt; 
&gt; I would appreciate any insight anyone might have on this.  I know the VNC
&gt; package fairly well, but I'm not all that familiar with X overall.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks ahead of time.
