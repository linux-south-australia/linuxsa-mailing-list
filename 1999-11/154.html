To all Linux SA experts on setting up internet radio stations:

I've just had an e-mail out of the blue asking about
how to set up an internet radio station.
The enquirer is in the Philippines.
So I guess the net connectivity aspects are different to
what you would think about in the USA or in Australia.

But then there's the question which I'd like to ask you,
which is:

Question:
Is linux a good choice for an internet radio station?

My first guess at the answer is:

1.	Linux is suitable from the point of view of
	being cheap, reliable, flexible etc. etc.

2.	I don't know what applications you would use for linux.
	But I bet there's something suitable out there.
	Trouble is, if you want to use RealPlayer type
	software, the company will:
	a.	Want an arm and a leg for their server software.
	b.	They probably don't support linux servers.

	And this leaves open the question as to whether
	the linux environment has some non-RealPlayer
	IP-radio server/client software.
	

3.	I have some memory that there's some IP broadcast
	software that was used with the MBONE in the
	old days (a couple of years ago) on Sparc Stations.
	Presumably that could be used for
	low quality sound (8-bit) still. But for music
	this would not be good.

Does anyone out there have info or useful links to help?
My own little list of audio/video net conferencing software
is at <A HREF="http://www.topology.org/avnet.html">http://www.topology.org/avnet.html</A> .
