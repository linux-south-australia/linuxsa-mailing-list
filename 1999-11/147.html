Thanks for replying. I just found out that MAIL variable in my /etc/profile is still
pointing to the ~/Maildir. I deleted that and the client are trying to access the
mail file in /var/spool/mail. However, I am getting this error now.

"Can't open folder '/var/spool/mail' for reading!"

What should the permission and spool file ownerships should be?

My /var/spool/mail has the following permissions.
drwxrwxrwt	root  mail	mail/

The mail files have the following permissions.
-rw-rw----	root  mail	root
-rw-------		subb3	users	subb3

Are these permissions correct? What kind of permissions and ownership are correct?

Thank you once again.

&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I am trying to access my mailbox on one of my Linux systems. I had installed
&gt;&gt; Qmail on it and later decided to move back to Sendmail. At first, all qmail
&gt;&gt; related material was deleted and later I went as far as reinstalling Linux.
&gt;&gt; The /home is on a different partition so the user data was secure. I use
&gt;&gt; ELM and MUTT. I have removed all references to Qmail from /home/users
&gt;&gt; directories.
&gt;
&gt;Are you sure that you have deleted all the files??? Are there any files
&gt;like .procmail or .fetchrc in the home directories??
&gt;
&gt;Try creating a new user and see if the mail for that user behaves, or if
&gt;it is still messing up.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I can't access any mail for the local user. The mailbox seems to get it,
&gt;&gt; but when I use mail, elm or mutt, it system seems to be looking in ~/Maildir,
&gt;&gt; which is a Qmail scheme of the mailbox. Please keep in mind this is a new
&gt;&gt; installation. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;For all users? Or just particular users? What about a new user? (added
&gt;after you removed QMail?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers
&gt;Dazz
