Hi,

&gt; &gt; The question I have now is why did a machine re-name
&gt; &gt; cause this problem ?
&gt; 
&gt; How did you do the rename?  I know linuxconf has gone and done funky
&gt; things behind my back before, which is why I no longer use it (dammit,
&gt; I like my sendmal.cf file the way it is!).

Hmm, and what I find interesting is as I manually configure parts of my
system, linuxconf coredumps (particularly dns).

Basic rename procedure was:

dns edit, new name, alias for old name (not done by me, out of my
control).

Log on as root, edit /etc/hosts, and /etc/HOSTNAME.
Machine still thinks its old name.

Start linuxconf, edit machine name in linuxconf, and check other settings.

Quit linuxconf (activating changes).

Machine still thinks itself is old name.

Now in a bit of a hurry and after a quick fix, re-boot.

machine comes up, mounting problems from solaris boxen, they share to real
names not aliases. Edit their share files. Mount -a, it works.

Try telnetting in to see if other machines have updated, and get the
error. Have to go, so leave it.

Yes I may not have had to re-boot, but it wouldn't have shown up another
couple of minor, and irrelevent to this discourse, problems. Sometimes
re-booting is quicker than restarting several services (tho as people
observed it keeps the uptime down :(

cya
