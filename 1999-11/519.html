..can anyone tell, why my computer locks during booting, when trying to run LILO. It displays LI and then dies before being able to finish the word LILO?...

Well, it happened to me, and I have this text I got from somewhere else (don't remember). Maybe this could help you understand what's happening. 

To fix it, create a boot floppy, mount the linux partition and reconfigure LILO.

LILO start message
- - - - - - - - -

When LILO loads itself, it displays the word "LILO". Each letter is printed before or after performing some specific action. If LILO fails at some point, the letters printed so far can be used to identify the problem. This is described in more detail in the technical overview.

Note that some hex digits may be inserted after the first "L" if a transient disk problem occurs. Unless LILO stops at that point, generating an endless stream of error codes, such hex digits do not indicate a severe problem.

  ({nothing})  No part of LILO has been loaded. LILO either isn't installed or the partition on which its boot sector is located isn't active. 
 
   L {error} ...   The first stage boot loader has been loaded and started, but it can't load the second stage boot loader. The two-digit error  codes indicate the type of problem. (See also section "Disk error codes".) This condition usually indicates a media failure or a geometry mismatch (e.g. bad disk parameters, see section "Disk geometry").

   LI   The first stage boot loader was able to load the second stage boot loader, but has failed to execute it. This can either be caused by a geometry mismatch or by moving /boot/boot.b without running the map installer.

   LIL   The second stage boot loader has been started, but it can't load the descriptor table from the map file. This is typically caused by a media failure or by a geometry mismatch. 

   LIL?   The second stage boot loader has been loaded at an incorrect address. This is typically caused by a subtle geometry mismatch or by moving /boot/boot.b without running the map installer.

   LIL-   The descriptor table is corrupt. This can either be caused by a geometry mismatch or by moving /boot/map without running the map installer.

   LILO   All parts of LILO have been successfully loaded.
