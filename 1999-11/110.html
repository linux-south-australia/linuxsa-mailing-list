&gt; &gt; &gt; One small problem we did find though was the resolution or quality of

&gt; &gt; Well, the resolution isn't as great as your average laser or dot-matrix
&gt; &gt; (Mmmm, Dot Matrix) ...  Do you have it set up for incoming faxes as
&gt; &gt; well?

Depends on your needs. HylaFax supports both high and low res fax. There
is a command-line switch on the sendfax program.

&gt; 
&gt; I think it's more the rastering of the printer driver, and even the software sending it, which
&gt; effects it. My colleuge has done some work in the past on HylaFax and said that it can be very picky
&gt; about the modem you use.  Or more importantly, you have to choose a modem , that complies strictly
&gt; with faxing standards to make sure you can send to all the Fax machines out there without a glitch.
&gt; 

True, you need to verify that the modem is compatible, or generate a
config file to suit. Ive been surprised that even the later 56k modems
with only class 1 support do actually work with Hylafax. Be aware that
Hylafax is picky about what it calls success. If the machine at the other
end is a bit crappy in it's conformance to the fax standards, and HylaFax
cannot guarrantee that it got all of the fax through, it will regard it as
an error. Our boxes have sent over 30,000 HylaFaxes over the last year,
and the error rate is very low especially if you remove wrong numbers from
the results.

&gt; And for now, we still use a real Paper (laser style) fax for incoming faxes.
&gt; *shrug* it works, and it's easier for the moment for the Sales people. :)
&gt; 

Agreed.
