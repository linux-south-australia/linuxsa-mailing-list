&gt; I do.  It works.  There is a "management" utility that lets you see
&gt; the status of the fax queues, plus a printer port monitor that lets
&gt; your print your document to the fax queue (a dialog box then prompts
&gt; you for a number, or retrieval from an address book like affair).
&gt; 

After wasting quite a bit of Money on several well known named products for
Windows Netowrk fax serving. (these include WinFax Pro ver 7 to 9, Net Satisfaxtion, and I think a couple more)

We are setting up a Hylafax server to do the job, and so far it's progressing very nicely.

We've ditched the Hylafax Windows client, in favour of setting up a Samba print queue on the box,
and by modifying the lpr command in samba to a custom built script, we can automagically send faxes
via HylaFax, or convert them to PDF's for emailing to a client, send notice back to the sales rep who sent it
and also, archive the original Postscript printed document (the file created when printing via a simple AppleLaser Writer
windows driver) so that it can be viewed and resent (email or fax) at any future time, with a simple Web interface.

It's a totally free experiance, and is providing us with possibilties that WinFax pro and netsatisfaxtion
could only dream of. And best of all, it works.

One small problem we did find though was the resolution or quality of the outgoing faxes.
But I'm fairly sure we've cleaned that up now too.

cheers,
