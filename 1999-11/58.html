&gt; Im currently developing microcontroller progs using a X assembler version of

&gt; In this application, the program NEVER stops running (has a while(1) loop

&gt; But of course, GCC doesnt like that and gives a warning saying main should
&gt; return an int value.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a way of disabling this 1 warning message?? It just gets annoying

We've discussed this before on this list.  Here's a brief summary:

- The ANSI standard says that main() must return an int to 
  be a conforming program.  

- On some compilers+architectures, a function returning void is 
  implemented differently to a function returning int, to the point 
  where the wrong declaration may produce a program that crashes.  
  main() is no exception.  

- GCC on Intel is more forgiving of this case, but that's not the 
  point.  Do not use the compiler's behaviour in any given situation 
  as a reference when trying to understand what's permitted.   

- The ANSI Standard is very much your friend.  Do everything you 
  can to stay within its bounds.  Once you stray into using bizarre 
  compilers on bizarre architectures (e.g. when developing embedded 
  code), non-standard code tends to produce really, really obscure 
  and costly bugs.  

- The whole Open Source movement is based on code sharing.  Code sharing 
  is based on conformance to the standard.  (Although, to be fair, GCC 
  is in many ways a de-facto standard in its own right.)  

- Stray from the standard only when you have tried extremely hard to 
  conform, have checked your design and implementation with other 
  experienced programmers, and am confident that the cost of 
  writing and maintaining nonstandard code is outweighed by the 
  benefits of doing so.  In the end, it's an engineering decision.  

- In this case, there's no cost in declaring the function as returning 
  int, and adding an (unreached) return 0; statement, and so that is how 
  you should address this issue.  

cheers,

Brenton

ps. If you wanted to suppress a particular warning, you could pipe the 
    compiler output through a filter like awk, sed or perl, and have the 
    filter delete the messages that you don't want to see.  But that's 
    really an action of last resort.
