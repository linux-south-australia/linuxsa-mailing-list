I think the motion is carried.
I built a PC back in January that has Celeron 300, 128Mb SDRAM, 2 HDDs, SB
DVD-ROM, Seagate Travan drive, SB Live, Netcomm56 internal, and RH6.1 picked up
most of that straight away.  I must admit, I haven't got it all working 100%
yet, but I'm getting there.
At least the box stays up for more than a day, which is more that I could ever
say about Windoze98.
Anyone got a suggestion for the modem and Live cards (I hate silence)?
Current kernel is 2.2.10 (no patches yet!)

Cheers.

I'll second what Toby's saying.

November last year I bought a brand new computer, with all new parts. At the
time my Riva TNT video card wasn't supported, and neither was my
Soundblaster Live (ok, so I bought that card a few months later). However,
now both work perfectly for my use in linux. Everything else works
perfectly, first go, and when I bought my hardware, I forgot all about Linux
support. I don't consider myself lucky that everything works, because Linux
is a good OS. Drivers seem to come out quite fast, so there's not much point
spending a lot of time worrying wether something is currently supported or
not.

Andy
&gt;
&gt; Alan,
&gt; Call me a freak, but I've managed to get linux going on every system
&gt; I've ever tried, including some pretty wierd ones at that.
&gt; Remember that although most things aren't listed in the linux kernel
&gt; drivers, most things ARE however based on them.
&gt; THere's been a couple of times I've needed to hack the source code to
&gt; get something to work, but that's 2 times out of hundreds and hundreds
&gt; of other times.
&gt; (Eg: A BTTV video card used the 848 chipset, but wasn't one of the known
&gt; brands in the kernel. I modified a couple of lines in the kernel and it
&gt; found it perfectly. THe next kernel revision included it anyway.)
&gt;
&gt; As long as you're not using bleeding-edge devices that don't have
&gt; backwards support, linux generally works fine.
&gt; However, it would be nice if hardware included a "Works with Linux"
&gt; sticker on 'em.
&gt; Opensource drivers would be nice too. My TV card works significantly
&gt; better under linux than it does in windows with it's native drivers.
&gt;
&gt; Having a "Linux PC Shop" seems to make it sound like linux REQUIRES
&gt; special hardware to work.
