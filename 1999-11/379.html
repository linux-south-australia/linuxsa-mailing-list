Jeremy,
you may have a ready-made customer base, judging by some of the posts on this list lately!

Your question is rather broad, depending on what facets of Linux you wish to learn, and what distributions you wish to use Linux through.

Probably best to start with the distro you are using, work out some of the features of it, and proceed from there.

There are many good online sites that can help you with various things (check out the Linux Documentation Project at <A HREF="http://www.linux.org.au/LDP/">http://www.linux.org.au/LDP/</A>), as well as the FAQs and HOWTOs that should be installed with your Linux system (usually in /usr/doc or similar location). 

This list is another good resource when you get stuck!

regards,
Andrew O'Callaghan

&gt; Hello to all everyone on the Linux users group.
&gt; 
&gt; I have just subscribed to the Linux mailing list approximately four or five
&gt; days ago. I am a new user to Linux and I'm interested in learning a lot more
&gt; about it !!!
&gt; 
&gt; I own a business specialising in computer hardware reselling, and at this stage
&gt; we specialise working with the unreliable "Microsoft" products. I am an experience
&gt; Microsoft network administrator and have had a lot of experience with almost
&gt; every MS operating system and a lot of software packages. Because of this experiance
&gt; with the MS packages, I can tell, it is only a matter of time until something
&gt; worthwhile like Linux is due to take over !!
&gt; 
&gt; As a frustrated user of MS products I am ready to make the switch to Linux,
&gt; and I wish to eventually sell prebuilt Linux systems rather than MS Windows
&gt; systems.
&gt; 
&gt; I am asking if anyone on the Linux users group is able to assist in helping
&gt; me out with learning the Linux environment or have an tips on how to get familiar
&gt; with it faster so I can move my business and my clients away from MS and into
&gt; Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone can help me out, I'd be happy to hear from you ...
&gt;
