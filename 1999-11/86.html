what incredible arrogance the 2k doom$ayer$ have in assuming their lives are so
unimaginably important that some disaster will befall them , and you, on y2k. 
Babies are born every minute, people DO get run over by buses, people ARE
starving in East Timor, and despite all this, the ego says on year 2000
something significantly bad is going to happen to me. It will be bad and I'm
the focus of my own attention span. 

Ultimately, so what if planes fall out of the sky (total gibberish) Try living
thru a force eight hurricane or Tsunami in Papua New Guinea that wipes 20 years
of a country's GDP. That's far more significant than an artifical number on a
calendar that isn't recognised incidentally by about 35% of the world!

For a long time I was amused by it, for a while I was annoyed by the drivel,
and now i am just plain angry at the stupidity.

A clever philospher once said it's impossible to DISprove a double negative.
"No cat has five eyes". Impossible to disprove.

In much the same way the doom$eeker$ have had a free ride. They got crushed,
utterly, with their idiot pronouncements about YOUR system crashing, only to
come back and say, well, yes, you're ok, but you can't assume the other guy is.
Lovey stuff
