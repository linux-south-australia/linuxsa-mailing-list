&gt; There's a SCO box, and a windows box. I'm trying to get some data from
&gt; SCO to Windows. I've connected them with Ethernet, and everything seems

&gt; ~2k, the ftp just stops. No errors. It just stops part way through.

A trace from tcpdump or ethereal from a third machine would let you
know if the receiver is waiting on the sender, or vica-versa (look
to see if all the data sent has been ACKed).  You shouldn't be seeing
any failed checksums (you have to calculate this by hand, as ethereal
doesn't do this yet), or RST or FIN flags.

Testing the ethernet card, etc is pretty easy -- telnet to the chargen
port from the Win 95 box.  You should see A...Z being printed forever.
You may need to change hosts.allow or inetd.conf to activate this.

Make sure that you haven't stuffed up any fast ethernet autonegotiation.
netstat or ifconfig should list any ethernet level errors.  SCO has
better instrumentation then Linux, so you should be able to get good error
counts for the IP and TCP leyers.

&gt; PS I know this is SCO, not Linux, but you guys are the only people I
&gt; know who are likely to know anything... :)

Without wanting to sound harsh, ring SCO's support line.  Superior
support is supposedly why you bought a commercial UNIX in the first
place.
