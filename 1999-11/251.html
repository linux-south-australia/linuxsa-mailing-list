&gt; 
&gt; I conclude that I must've been on drugs when previously trying
&gt; to retrieve that URL, as I managed to retrieve it successfully
&gt; later on today.  And this is probably what your problem is:

&gt; Somehow, I suspect that the MIME type for PNG isn't
&gt; application/octet-stream.  If you can tell me what the MIME type
&gt; should be, I can get their web server update to emit the correct
&gt; MIME for that file type.  It still won't help you with browsers
&gt; that don't support PNG image formats.

G'day Darryl,

I am sure you are right that png files are not mime type 
application/octet-stream, or at least that if the web server is set up
that way you are sure to confuse web browser software.

This would explain why netscape behaves differently when viewing the
page as local filesystem files. As Allan Kenington wrote it seems that
MIME type image/png is what is called for in the png docs. You offered
to have the picknowl web server updated to emit the correct mime type.
Will you do that?

Thanks in advance,

Bruce Moffatt
