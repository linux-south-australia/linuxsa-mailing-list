&gt; Edited /etc/HOSTNAME, and /etc/hosts, and used linuxconf to edit machine
&gt; name.
&gt; 
&gt; Re-booted:

Rebooting is such a Microsoft thing to do. Next time use `hostname`
(`man hostname` for more details).

Alternatively, look at the scripts in /etc/rc.d to see what your
machine is doing at boot time with respect to hostname setting.

On a related note, there are very few problems wth Linux that can be
'fixed' by rebooting. It usually just means the machine comes up the
way it was with the same problem and less means of tracking it. (Not
to mention it ruins your uptime!)  :o)

It's a good to get into the habit of forcing yourself never to reboot
and to work out what the problem is and to solve it without rebooting
(hardware problems aside). Linux isn't Windows and it can take quite a
bit of time to get used to the fact that rebooting solves very little.

There is nothing quite as satisfying as a machine with a year+ uptime
and processes (htpd, named, etc) that have been running for months and
months.

Speaking of uptimes, what is the prefered method for obtaining an
uptime remotely?

Cheers

Alex!
