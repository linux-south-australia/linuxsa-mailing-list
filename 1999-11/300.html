Hello everyone.

I remember not too long ago someone on this list was building a PC
himself. Now I want to do same and wanted to get some advice. I never done
it from scratch yet.

I wanted to get in touch with that person, forgot who the person was. So
if you got time for answering some of my questions by email can you please
reply to me. Probably off-list.

I am not planning on taking too much of ut time as I am looking for
sources of informations rather than for someone explaining it to me.

I probably need to start with looking at what's new out there, learning
what it is, and compatability issues. Price/performance trade offs and
actual hardware suppliers.

and second question is not related and not so important:
 `man hdparm` says there is a flag that if set drive ignores write
errors. Is there a way to ignore read errors? I think that is what needed
when I had prob when making an image of a disk with bad sectors. I
remember using DOS diskcopy to make a copy of a floppy with bad sectors
and that worked. Reproted error but worked. There must be a way to do it
with linux and probably with hard drive too.

Any help is realy appreciated.

Thank you in advance.

Eugene
