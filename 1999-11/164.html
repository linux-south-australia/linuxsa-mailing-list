Eugene,

Somebody said to me, when I asked him what was so bad about Linux -- and
you'll have to excuse my outrageous paraphrase but it was a long time ago
-- that large disk transfers (under Linux) cause serial connections to lose
data.  Without reference to the veracity of what he said, it does sound
like what you are experiencing.  If I was to hazard a guess it would be
that the disk driver blocks interrupts for so long that characters are
lost.  I guess you could confirm the theory by compiling the serial driver
with SERIAL_DEBUG_INTR defined and looking for the "status = %x" entries.
Bit 0x02 set indicates that characters were lost.  Be warned that you'll
get lots of output (displayed by dmesg, I suppose) and I couldn't advise
you leave SERIAL_DEBUG_INTR on for normal use.

If your problem is receive buffer overrun and if you have a 16550A you can
modify /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/serial.c to reduce it from 8 to (say)
4, or even 1.  Replace UART_FCR_TRIGGER_8 with something smaller.

David
