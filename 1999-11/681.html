Bruce,

When you dialin to your ISP your machine will receive a new IP address.
Sounds like the X server is only configured to allow connections from a
particular set of addresses (ie local host 127.0.0.1 only ?).  To confirm my
belief try running 'xhost +' in a terminal window and see if the behaviour
changes whilst connected to your ISP.  Now to fix the problem, umm........

Regards,

Richard

Subject: dialup Mandrake weirdness


&gt; Good people,
&gt;
&gt; I have a little problem that someone may be able to shed some light on.
&gt;
&gt; I run Manduck 6.1 on a 6x86Mx PC, with KDE as the default desktop/wm. I
&gt; recently attempted to upgrade the initscripts, kernel and kernel source
&gt; from 2.2.13-7 to 2.2.13-22 (just because I can, I spose). I used the
&gt; Manduck update program, which ftp's the rpms and 'rpms' them for you.
&gt; This part seemed to work. I had trouble with some modules, and reverted
&gt; back to the previous kernel using rpm on the command line. _ALMOST_
&gt; everything came back as expected, except that now when I use kppp to
&gt; dial up the ISP, once a connection has been established no new progs can
&gt; start under X. e.g.
&gt; $ netscape-communicator
&gt; Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
&gt; Xlib: Client is not authorized to connect to Server
&gt; Error: Can't open display: :0
&gt;
&gt; is the invariable outcome. Note that this only comes into play once the
&gt; handshaking has happened between me and the ISP server.
&gt;
&gt; This is causing me a bit of grief. I can use netscrape etc etc so long
&gt; as they have been run up _prior to_ kppp making the dialup connection.
&gt;
&gt; Any pointers would be appreciated. So far the manduck mailing list has
&gt; yeilded no answer.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt;
&gt; Bruce
