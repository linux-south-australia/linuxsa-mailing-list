Daryl,

Thanks for that reply.
I just wasn't looking at the right thing.
Now it's obvious that 

-	Telnet resolves the addresses geekboys.org
	and www.geekboys.org differently
-	nslookup resolves them the same.

But my /etc/resolv.conf file contains:

=============================================
search topology.org
nameserver 203.38.148.51
=============================================

which is pretty straightforward, and corresponds to
what my nslookup program is doing.

So this obviously means that:

-	Telnet and netscape both have the same
	non-standard lookup procedure for
	domain names.
-	Nslookup uses the correct standard procedure.

In fact, already many times in the past,
I have noticed that my browser on emu.topology.org
(SuSE 6.2) often says that an address is _not_ in
the DNS, while a RH 5.2 browser says that it _is_
in the DNS.

So this now seems to come down to what the address resolution
software on the SuSE 6.2 (kernel 2.2.10) machine is
doing wrong. It clearly is not going through
the standard sequence of just checking /etc/hosts,
and then checking the DNS as in /etc/resolv.conf etc.

Does anyone happen to know what I should look for to
track down this name resolution error?
(Apart from reading the source of the name resolution
library, I hope.)

Regards,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  About remote uptime indications,
on a local network, ruptime and so forth seem to work.
But remotely, "finger" seems to be the most natural way
to do this -- if you can find a machine that will trust
you to run finger on it.
