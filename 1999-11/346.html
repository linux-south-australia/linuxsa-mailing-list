I'll second what Toby's saying.

November last year I bought a brand new computer, with all new parts. At the
time my Riva TNT video card wasn't supported, and neither was my
Soundblaster Live (ok, so I bought that card a few months later). However,
now both work perfectly for my use in linux. Everything else works
perfectly, first go, and when I bought my hardware, I forgot all about Linux
support. I don't consider myself lucky that everything works, because Linux
is a good OS. Drivers seem to come out quite fast, so there's not much point
spending a lot of time worrying wether something is currently supported or
not.

&gt; Alan,
&gt; Call me a freak, but I've managed to get linux going on every system
&gt; I've ever tried, including some pretty wierd ones at that.
&gt; Remember that although most things aren't listed in the linux kernel
&gt; drivers, most things ARE however based on them.
&gt; THere's been a couple of times I've needed to hack the source code to
&gt; get something to work, but that's 2 times out of hundreds and hundreds
&gt; of other times.
&gt; (Eg: A BTTV video card used the 848 chipset, but wasn't one of the known
&gt; brands in the kernel. I modified a couple of lines in the kernel and it
&gt; found it perfectly. THe next kernel revision included it anyway.)
&gt;
&gt; As long as you're not using bleeding-edge devices that don't have
&gt; backwards support, linux generally works fine.
&gt; However, it would be nice if hardware included a "Works with Linux"
&gt; sticker on 'em.
&gt; Opensource drivers would be nice too. My TV card works significantly
&gt; better under linux than it does in windows with it's native drivers.
&gt;
&gt; Having a "Linux PC Shop" seems to make it sound like linux REQUIRES
&gt; special hardware to work.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; PS. Ever tried getting non-linux unix to work on strange machines? Makes
&gt; linux look easy by comparision.

&gt; &gt; Kevin,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; According to the oceania web page, you're in
&gt; &gt; Port Macquarie, NSW.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This just emphasizes the lack of linux
&gt; &gt; stores in Adelaide.
&gt; &gt; I think that for decades, Adelaide and Perth
&gt; &gt; have been regarded as country towns by the
&gt; &gt; eastern states.
&gt; &gt; No matter what the reality is, it is still the
&gt; &gt; way that people think.
&gt; &gt; This is only a broadbrush view, of course.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have often stated that if a PC store in
&gt; &gt; Adelaide renamed itself to "Linux Adelaide"
&gt; &gt; or "Linux PC Adelaide" or something like that,
&gt; &gt; then they would have excellent prospects
&gt; &gt; for the next 10 years.
&gt; &gt; Of course, dual boot PCs could be a speciality.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't know if PC stores actually make a
&gt; &gt; good profit. I imagine that it's a dog eat dog
&gt; &gt; business with lots of marginal operations.
&gt; &gt; But by dominating a single niche like linux
&gt; &gt; within our little country town, maybe a real
&gt; &gt; success could be made of it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; More than anything, I _wanted_ to find a
&gt; &gt; linux PC store in Adelaide for the last 12 months.
&gt; &gt; I wasted huge amounts of valuable time doing
&gt; &gt; all of my own research into what works with linux
&gt; &gt; and what doesn't.
&gt; &gt; Unlike the (legacy) MS OS situation, hardware
&gt; &gt; suppliers are not yet providing a little
&gt; &gt; floppy disk or CD with drivers for their hardware.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I still assert that adopting linux for one's home
&gt; &gt; PC requires courage and stamina.
&gt; &gt; A PC shop that it is going to specialize in
&gt; &gt; linux in Adelaide should do well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Q1:     What is the experience interstate?
&gt; &gt;         Are there shops in the eastern states
&gt; &gt;         (or Perth) which make linux a primary
&gt; &gt;         aspect of their publicity and advertising,
&gt; &gt;         or part of their business name?
&gt; &gt;         If so, do they get lots of linux customers,
&gt; &gt;         and do they get good business from that?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Q2:     Are there any stores in our sleepy country
&gt; &gt;         town of Adelaide which do this? I.e. are
&gt; &gt;         there any which state in advertising etc.
&gt; &gt;         that they provide linux-friendly hardware?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think a problem with this, and which has been
&gt; &gt; expressed to me often, is that there's no money in
&gt; &gt; it, basically because linux users want everything for
&gt; &gt; nothing, and time is money. If someone needs a problem
&gt; &gt; dealt with in a legacy OS, you sell them more stuff
&gt; &gt; (hardware and/or software). If your customer has a linux
&gt; &gt; PC problem, you spend hours advising them, and then they
&gt; &gt; go out and get the solution free on the net.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The only hope for a "linux PC shop" would be that
&gt; &gt; a linux specialist could, at least initially, get
&gt; &gt; good business out of selling hardware to a niche
&gt; &gt; that no one else can service.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think that over the next 10 years, linux should
&gt; &gt; grow very quickly. Everyone on this list probably
&gt; &gt; believes this. But no one in Adelaide believes in it
&gt; &gt; enough to bet their house on it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe in the next 12 months, someone _will_ bet their
&gt; &gt; house on it, and open "Linux Adelaide", a PC shop
&gt; &gt; with staff wearing penguin suits, etc. etc. etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hmmm. Thinks: "Must develop terser literary style."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheerio,
&gt; &gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PS.  I almost certainly need to buy a laptop
&gt; &gt; in the next week or two, and I want to put linux
&gt; &gt; on it, and it has to be set up as a business computer,
&gt; &gt; which means that it must be able to create
&gt; &gt; and use MS-format documents and presentation slides.
&gt; &gt; Where on earth do I go to get this?
&gt; &gt; I can't afford to spend another 6 months researching
&gt; &gt; this. Time is money. Where is the "linux laptop shop"
&gt; &gt; in Adelaide where I can get this?
&gt; &gt; Maybe I have to look interstate??!
