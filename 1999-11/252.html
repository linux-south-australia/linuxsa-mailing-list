I've noticed that web servers have a default mime type for when they
don't know what to do with a file. Apache often seems to be set to
text/plain, whereas NT/IIS seems to default to application/octet-stream.
So it's not so much that NT is configured wrong here, mroe that it just
plain doesn't know what a .png is. i think. Same solution applies
anyway.

&gt; &gt; I conclude that I must've been on drugs when previously trying
&gt; &gt; to retrieve that URL, as I managed to retrieve it successfully
&gt; &gt; later on today.  And this is probably what your problem is:

&gt; &gt; Somehow, I suspect that the MIME type for PNG isn't
&gt; &gt; application/octet-stream.  If you can tell me what the MIME type
&gt; &gt; should be, I can get their web server update to emit the correct
&gt; &gt; MIME for that file type.  It still won't help you with browsers
&gt; &gt; that don't support PNG image formats.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt;   Daryl Tester
&gt; 
&gt; G'day Darryl,
&gt; 
&gt; I am sure you are right that png files are not mime type
&gt; application/octet-stream, or at least that if the web server is set up
&gt; that way you are sure to confuse web browser software.
&gt; 
&gt; This would explain why netscape behaves differently when viewing the
&gt; page as local filesystem files. As Allan Kenington wrote it seems that
&gt; MIME type image/png is what is called for in the png docs. You offered
&gt; to have the picknowl web server updated to emit the correct mime type.
&gt; Will you do that?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce Moffatt
