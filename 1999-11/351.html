Subject: Philosophy (Was: Corel have done it!)


&gt;&gt; I've just downloaded and installed Corel Linux.
&gt;
&gt;Philosophical ramble follows.  Don't expect it to have any
point.
&gt;
&gt;I admire Corel.  They are being genuinely nice people.
They clearly
&gt;support the Linux movement through their own distribution,
and through
&gt;support of WINE, and by making their products available on
Linux.  I
&gt;suspect that their prime motivation is purely commercial.
They own
&gt;WordPerfect, which once was the dominant word processor but
is now far, far
&gt;second fiddle to Microsoft Word.  Word is clearly the
better program (in my
&gt;highly experienced opinion), and anyway they can't knock
Microsoft out of
&gt;first place on Microsoft's own operating system, so it is
in their best
&gt;interest to try to foster a competing platform.  If that
platform wins a
&gt;sizeable market share from MS, and if their applications
are available on
&gt;day one, so to speak, they will do very nicely.
&gt;
&gt;It's a shame that the program is so awful.  I wanted to buy
it, I really
&gt;did, because I want to support a serious competitor to
Microsoft.  I forced
&gt;myself to use WP8 for more than long enough, and it just
got worse and
&gt;worse.  It was a terrible experience for me.  Please,
please Corel, ditch
&gt;WP8 and start again.
&gt;
&gt;While I'm about it, I admire Sun.  They are being genuinely
nice people,
&gt;too.  They have always supported the unix community, in
fact I think MS
&gt;think that Sun is the enemy.  The enemy of my enemy is my
friend.  Sun! my
&gt;friend!  And they bought Star Office and are now giving it
away!  And on
&gt;Windows, too!  Whoohoo, way to go.  It probably sounds the
death knell for
&gt;WP, although Star Office is S--L--O--W.  I think they have
actually out
&gt;Microsofted Microsoft in the big binary stakes.  I can't
decide between
&gt;Applixware, which sadly comes with no trial version, and
TeX.  Maybe I
&gt;should just write in raw PostScript.
