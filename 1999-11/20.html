Ok, so what you really mean is that your *BIOS* has a 4 Gbyte
partition limit.  The only real-world limitation this presents to a
32-bit operating system is that your boot partition must be less than
4 Gbytes in size, because the BIOS is used to load various
bootstrap-type stuff at initialization time.

Once you have your 32-bit OS loaded (whether it's NT, Linux, BSD, or
anything else), you don't have to care about limitations presented by
the BIOS because you don't need the BIOS to do I/O.

As an example, if you put a RAID card in your machine you'll be able
to drive volumes many Gbytes in size whether the PC's BIOS can see
them or not.  You don't have to get that extravagent, though: If you
have a second disk on your machine (or a first disk which is large
enough to host your boot partition and at least one other partition
bigger than 4 Gbytes) you shouldn't have any problems accessing your
large partitions, provided you can convince whatever OS you're using
to look at the hardware to find its partition list instead of
inventorying them with a BIOS call prior to protected-mode entry at
system initialization time (which is how you can access dozens of
disks at a time on a SCSI Linux system even if the BIOS can only see 4
of them, for example).
