Good people,

I have a little problem that someone may be able to shed some light on.

I run Manduck 6.1 on a 6x86Mx PC, with KDE as the default desktop/wm. I
recently attempted to upgrade the initscripts, kernel and kernel source
from 2.2.13-7 to 2.2.13-22 (just because I can, I spose). I used the
Manduck update program, which ftp's the rpms and 'rpms' them for you.
This part seemed to work. I had trouble with some modules, and reverted
back to the previous kernel using rpm on the command line. _ALMOST_
everything came back as expected, except that now when I use kppp to
dial up the ISP, once a connection has been established no new progs can
start under X. e.g.
$ netscape-communicator
Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
Xlib: Client is not authorized to connect to Server
Error: Can't open display: :0                                         

is the invariable outcome. Note that this only comes into play once the
handshaking has happened between me and the ISP server.

This is causing me a bit of grief. I can use netscrape etc etc so long
as they have been run up _prior to_ kppp making the dialup connection.

Any pointers would be appreciated. So far the manduck mailing list has
yeilded no answer.

Thanks in advance.

Bruce
