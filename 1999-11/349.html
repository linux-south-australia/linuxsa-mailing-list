&gt; Kevin,

&gt; According to the oceania web page, you're in
&gt; Port Macquarie, NSW.

Correct

&gt;
&gt; I don't know if PC stores actually make a
&gt; good profit. I imagine that it's a dog eat dog
&gt; business with lots of marginal operations.
&gt; But by dominating a single niche like linux
&gt; within our little country town, maybe a real
&gt; success could be made of it.

The population of Port Maquarie is approx 40,000
We make a modest profit from computers/ISP/linux/
and network services.
Adelaide, being much larger would easily support
 a "linux PC shop". I t is mostly a matter of marketing.
If you believe in the product you sell, it is easy to sell.
Q1:     What is the experience interstate?

&gt;         Are there shops in the eastern states
&gt;         (or Perth) which make linux a primary
&gt;         aspect of their publicity and advertising,
&gt;         or part of their business name?
&gt;         If so, do they get lots of linux customers,
&gt;         and do they get good business from that?

Lots of linux customers? No.
But an increasing number of linux customers.
Linux is flavour of the month and is a reliable product.
For our networking support we have converted many
local business to linux servers as we esplained the saving
to them interms of maintenance dollars,

&gt; I think that over the next 10 years, linux should
&gt; grow very quickly. Everyone on this list probably
&gt; believes this. But no one in Adelaide believes in it
&gt; enough to bet their house on it.

You do not need to bet your house.
Linux is just one aspect of a viable business

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Maybe in the next 12 months, someone _will_ bet their
&gt; house on it, and open "Linux Adelaide", a PC shop
&gt; with staff wearing penguin suits, etc. etc. etc.

hmm, Sounds like our shop

&gt;
&gt; PS.  I almost certainly need to buy a laptop
&gt; in the next week or two, and I want to put linux
&gt; on it, and it has to be set up as a business computer,

Why not buy one with linux pre installed?

Kind regards
Kevin
