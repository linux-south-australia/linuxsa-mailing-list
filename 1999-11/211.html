Hmm, i think it could be that Netscape or IE have no inbuilt support for png!
It normally will try and load quicktime to display pngs. (This is most
annoying). This has been the reason we have stayed with the old gif's.
Netscape/Mozilla 5 will include png support though.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; sorry this is off topic i.e. not Linux specific, please delete now if
&gt; you don't want to read about how I am having trouble converting my html
&gt; pages from using gif picture files to png picture files.
&gt;
&gt; I decided to heed advice on one of the Linux discussion forums I read
&gt; regularly and convert all gif images to png. The conversion went
&gt; smoothly on the local box (manduck linux 6.1, netscrape 4.61) using the
&gt; gif2png file converter. Viewing the html pages locally works well, all
&gt; images still viewable as expected. I used vi to edit the html, and moved
&gt; the gif images to a temp directory so as not to confuse myself.
&gt;
&gt; After loading the pages to the ISP (uses NT) the pages show a 'broken
&gt; image link' where the png images are located on the page. I tried
&gt; hitting 'reload' to make sure it was not a caching problem. I saved the
&gt; html page as seen from the server using 'save as' and checked that the
&gt; page points to the right image file name. I re-loaded the png files to
&gt; the server making sure I used binary mode ftp transfer. Still no luck.
&gt;
&gt; The question to the group is, has anyone come across a similar problem,
&gt; or seen any discussion that might shed light? I would be most grateful
&gt; for enlightenment.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to see a live example, point at:
