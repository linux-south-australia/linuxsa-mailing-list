&gt; D'day everyone
&gt; 
&gt; I just installed RH6.0 and can't get X windows to work. It detected my
&gt; VideoCard ok. (Tseng Labs) Chose resulution and went to test X and stoped
&gt; there with a black screen. Monitor has an LCD and says it's getting
&gt; signal, correct resolutions and frequency (as I selected) but screen is
&gt; back and no action. Once it came out of it with an error. I tried to chose
&gt; different settings and it never comes out of it again. CTRL+ALT+DEL was my
&gt; solution. I could not reproduce the error and can't remember it.
&gt; With RH5.0 it got detected and worked 10/10 times every and any install on
&gt; resolution!
&gt; 
&gt; Mouse does not work either. I am using mouseconfig to select a mouse type
&gt; and I tried them all now. It's 6 year old Mitsumi mouse. with RH5.0 mouse
&gt; worked fine with Logitech and worked somehow with M$. Now it does not wotk
&gt; at all. When I move it occasionaly jumps in random directions, but usualy
&gt; does nothing. I tried connecting M$ mouse, but same story.
&gt; 
&gt; Here comes part where I need to give you more info. I am sill new so tell
&gt; me what info I need to supply and how to get it, pleeaaaase!
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you in advance.
&gt; 
&gt; Eugene
&gt; 
&gt; ps. Maybe I should go back to RH5.0 :)
&gt;

I've found XF86Setup useful in the past. note the case
