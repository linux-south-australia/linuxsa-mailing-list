HI

I cleaner way in the same vain is to just add and remove routes from the
internet gateway. (even if your ip masking this is will work)

1. a ethernet card for each room in the server
2. a subnet for each room

&gt;G'Day,
&gt;    I am just a novice at this myself, but sounds to me that
&gt;the easiest way to set this up is to set up a network in
&gt;each classroom that runs through a single server, and then
&gt;run a single connection from each server to an Internet
&gt;gateway machine to the outside. In this way you could set up
&gt;a proxy on each classroom that blocks everything by default,
&gt;that the teacher could then be allowed to modify the proxy
&gt;restrictions only, without allowing access to anything they
&gt;could damage which could happen if they had full root
&gt;access. This also allows each classroom to be accessed
&gt;independently, since all traffic just passes through the
&gt;server to the gateway, and unblocking 1 classroom doesn't
&gt;open up any other classroom. It also allows you to set up
&gt;double firewall security to restrict access from the
&gt;outside. Classroom traffic could be easily logged also
&gt;because the only logs would be for each classroom, and not
&gt;have to be filtered and separated at the gateway. Finally,
&gt;by running through a proxy, you wouldn't have to disable the
&gt;route from the classroom to the gateway, and so your E-Mail
&gt;etc wouldn't be blocked when the class block was on. As I
&gt;said before, I am also a novice at this, but even though
&gt;there is probably a better way to do this, it seems that it
&gt;is far easier for root to set up a script that the teacher
&gt;only can run that copies proxy rules over to open and close
&gt;the connection, and from a hardware point of view, if you
&gt;have a network in each classroom, then it is a simple case
&gt;of nominating 1 machine to be the "server" if you don't
&gt;already have one, and then you just need one machine for the
&gt;gateway/firewall that each "server" is connected to. Good
&gt;Luck anyhow.
&gt;
&gt;    Cheers!
&gt;        Andrew.

&gt;Subject: Internet Routing Security
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hi all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am planning on running up an internet gateway, using
&gt;linux, for a small school. There is 3 different classrooms,
&gt;and each classroom needs to authenticate before using the
&gt;internet. (ie the teacher has to run a program or script,
&gt;type in a password, and the whole room has access)
&gt;&gt;However, each class room needs to operate independent of
&gt;the others.
&gt;&gt;Initially the internet link with be 56k.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions as to how
&gt;this could be implimented?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thankyou for your suggestions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;-matt
