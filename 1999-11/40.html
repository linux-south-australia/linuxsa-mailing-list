Hi Jake,

I have been following this discusion with interest because I have a similar
problem.

I have Red Hat Linux 6.0 setup here at work. My work has a perminant
internet connection, my problem is that I don't have any name resolution at
the command prompt (using telnet, ftp , mail etc). When I was running
Windows NT 4.0 I had a static IP address (which I have transfered to this
install of linux) and was able to get to the internet without going through
my works proxy. Now I have to go through the proxy to get out (which is not
good because not I am restricted by the proxy filter list).

Hopefully I have given you enough info, can you help at all?

Thanks
Justin

is this error from linux or a LAN machine?

&gt;  If I delete all my settings to the network card things seem ok.

what do you mean by this? sorry if you are referring to some GUI tool
that I'm not familiar with, but I would have thought "deleting all
settings" would be a bad thing :)

&gt; So, am I looking at the gateway address on my network card?

I dont know, are you? :)


&gt; Will I need to set up masquerading or is that just for letting other
&gt; computers connect through mines?


masquerading is where machine A accepts packets from machines X Y & Z,
and forwards them on *as if those packets came from machine A*. this way
machines X Y & Z came share the same modem link on machine A.




Are you trying to get the LAN to see the 'net using the linux as a
gateway?
	if yes:
		masquerading.
	if no:
		Are you trying to mantain connections to the LAN whilst you are
connected to the 'net?
		if yes:
			pppd may (is) be overwriting your routing table apon connection.
check man pppd and look for defaultroot
		if no:
			more info is needed.
