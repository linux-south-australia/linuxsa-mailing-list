Hmmm....

I have found some rather good debugging utils for the HC11... some of which
are quite new and are still being developed.

Yeh... at TAFE they teach HC11 programming using the hitech C compiler and
the old DOS IDE (they dont have the money to upgrade to the windows ver).
Its funny, after playing with the ported GCC a bit, ive found that Hitech's
C compiler is an absolute load of bollocks, even though it is considered to
be one of the best compilers around.
The GCC port for the HC11 by Stephane Carrez
(<A HREF="http://home.worldnet.fr/stcarrez/m68hc11_port.html">http://home.worldnet.fr/stcarrez/m68hc11_port.html</A>) is sooo much better
than Hitech's compiler. Its optimisation is a lot better, and all the code
is PROPPER ANSI C.

&gt; Excuse the length of replied section of this post, but your comments are
&gt; pertinent, and I would like to back up what you say.  I have 30+ years
&gt; experience of writing C only for embedded systems.
&gt;
&gt; One of the salient features of many embedded projects is an almost total
lack
&gt; of debugging ability. You simply cannot breakpoint anywhere, and most
embedded
&gt; applications have no stdio of any kind. The concept of stdout is a little
&gt; strange when you're switching traffic lights &lt;grin&gt;.
&gt;
&gt; To get round this, a viable method is to use a standard compiler (such as
GNU)
&gt; on a standard OS (such as linux) to test the embedded code. Typically,
this
&gt; involves wrapping the entire project inside (let's say) embedded_main()
and
&gt; calling it from main(). Everything inside main is #defined out on the
embedded
&gt; compile except for a single call to embedded_main(). You can then use
stderr
&gt; and other facilites to debug code.
&gt;
&gt; What is immutable in this picture, is that source code *must* be generic
and
&gt; standard. Very typically, a manufacturer of chip 'X' supplies a reasonable
C
&gt; compiler for it. You can be certain, it cannot have, and will never have,
the
&gt; advanced "lint" type features of GNU. It simply won't and can't find the
really
&gt; strange gotchas (missing include include include files, wrongly phrased
int's
&gt; when you meant shorts, etc ad infinitum. Australian Hitech compilers are
&gt; perhaps the best crafted embedded compilers in the world. They are badge
&gt; engineered in the US so the yanks think they're home grown, they don't
lint
&gt; very well at all).
&gt;
&gt; In my world, it is imperative to test my embedded C source with a
real -world
&gt; compiler such as gnu. I WANT the compiler to scream at me, I welcome it
&gt; complaining very loudly about void main(void). The original author of this
&gt; post, is, i think, missing the whole point of using good syntax to begin
with.
&gt; The last thing I would want to do, no matter how innocuous it would
appear, is
&gt; cripple a warning message when my embededd eprom is going to end up on a
flight
&gt; control system somewhere. They are awfully difficult to fix after the
event.
&gt;
&gt; You are also quite correct about void functions being handled differently.
In
&gt; Hitech's case for HC11's and 68340's it is optimised to jumps, not call
subs.
&gt; This makes bugger all difference to all functions except main() and
exit().
&gt; The startup asm code makes wrong assumptions (it sets the stack
incorrectly),
&gt; and exit() pops the stack to oblivion.
&gt;
&gt; It's a case of shooting the messenger rather than fixing the fault! Fix
the
&gt; cause of the warning, don't cripple a warning message coz you dont like
it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Im currently developing microcontroller progs using a X assembler
version of
&gt; &gt; &gt; GCC.
&gt; &gt; &gt; In this application, the program NEVER stops running (has a while(1)
loop
&gt; &gt; &gt; inside) so i setup main to be "void main(void)".
&gt; &gt; &gt; But of course, GCC doesnt like that and gives a warning saying main
should
&gt; &gt; &gt; return an int value.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there a way of disabling this 1 warning message?? It just gets
annoying
&gt; &gt; &gt; after a while, as im a "make a small change, recompile" type guy :P
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We've discussed this before on this list.  Here's a brief summary:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - The ANSI standard says that main() must return an int to
&gt; &gt;   be a conforming program.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - On some compilers+architectures, a function returning void is
&gt; &gt;   implemented differently to a function returning int, to the point
&gt; &gt;   where the wrong declaration may produce a program that crashes.
&gt; &gt;   main() is no exception.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - GCC on Intel is more forgiving of this case, but that's not the
&gt; &gt;   point.  Do not use the compiler's behaviour in any given situation
&gt; &gt;   as a reference when trying to understand what's permitted.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - The ANSI Standard is very much your friend.  Do everything you
&gt; &gt;   can to stay within its bounds.  Once you stray into using bizarre
&gt; &gt;   compilers on bizarre architectures (e.g. when developing embedded
&gt; &gt;   code), non-standard code tends to produce really, really obscure
&gt; &gt;   and costly bugs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - The whole Open Source movement is based on code sharing.  Code sharing
&gt; &gt;   is based on conformance to the standard.  (Although, to be fair, GCC
&gt; &gt;   is in many ways a de-facto standard in its own right.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - Stray from the standard only when you have tried extremely hard to
&gt; &gt;   conform, have checked your design and implementation with other
&gt; &gt;   experienced programmers, and am confident that the cost of
&gt; &gt;   writing and maintaining nonstandard code is outweighed by the
&gt; &gt;   benefits of doing so.  In the end, it's an engineering decision.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - In this case, there's no cost in declaring the function as returning
&gt; &gt;   int, and adding an (unreached) return 0; statement, and so that is how
&gt; &gt;   you should address this issue.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; cheers,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Brenton
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ps. If you wanted to suppress a particular warning, you could pipe the
&gt; &gt;     compiler output through a filter like awk, sed or perl, and have the
&gt; &gt;     filter delete the messages that you don't want to see.  But that's
&gt; &gt;     really an action of last resort.
