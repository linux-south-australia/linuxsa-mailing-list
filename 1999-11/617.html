I have have exactly the same problem with RH6 which has been recently
installed after a bit of a struggle.

Thinking that the problem is with wrong selection of the display drivers
(Video Excel ag240g 8MB is not one of the listed options), I tried to run
xconf to create a new XF86Conf file, where I selected the most basic driver
(VGA, second time SVGA...).

 Unfortunatelly, the problem still persists and I think that I will need
some help.

Subject: gdm - no go!


&gt; Hi gurus,
&gt;
&gt; When I thought all was OK the inevitable happened!
&gt; I am using RedHat 6.0. All setup well and nice, I connected this morning
&gt; Sunday 28th of November with no problems whatsoever and checked the
&gt; mail. Around lunch time I wanted to go on the Net again, but this time I
&gt; could not login :(
&gt; Very sad indeed! Error messages on the screen after it flashes about 10
&gt; times, it stops and comes us with:
&gt;
&gt; "According to /var/run/gdm.pid gdm was already running (468)
&gt; but seems to have been murdered mysteriously!"
&gt;
&gt; Then again and again nine times, the only dif being the number in
&gt; brackets, each time is increased by 7 ie. (468) then next messges will
&gt; have (475) then (482) and so on.
&gt;
&gt; Last line contains the following:
&gt; "INIT: Id "x" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes!
&gt;
&gt; After 5 minutes it starts all over again, same thing happens.
&gt; Any suggestions would be welcome as this is a totally new problem never
&gt; encountered before.
&gt; One last thing, while the screen stops from blinking I can reboot with
&gt; everything OK apart from the following:
&gt;
&gt; "Stopping INND service:
&gt; FAILED"
&gt; "Shutting down X font server:
&gt; FAILED"
&gt;
&gt; Thank you anticipated and best wishes,
&gt;
&gt; Nick.
