David,

The odd thing about the message 

&gt; lsof: WARNING: compiled for Linux release 2.0.34; this is 2.0.36. 

is that I thought that when I installed redhat 5.2,
it should have installed a version of lsof which
matched the kernel 2.0.36.

The mismatch in other things _does_ make sense,
because it seems that I did remake the kernel
a few times. 
Since I didn't realize I even had a program "lsof",
I certainly didn't know that I had to recompile it
every time I remake the kernel.

And I guess I was kind of curious to know if I was the
only one with redhat 5.2 whose lsof was compiled
for kernel 2.0.34 instead of 2.0.36.

But it is not at all important.
The important thing is that now I have a better
understanding of the annoying attack against
my system on Friday.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  Since it's Sunday, it occurs to me that
the castles of Europe, inspiring though they may be,
originate in rape, pillage, and murder, and
nastier things than that. Then villagers built
progressively more onerous battlements to protect
themselves. The castles of Europe are a bit like
the defence systems of computers now.
Inspiring though the linux defences may be,
one should not forget the thousands of
person-years of lost creativity which have
prompted these defence against the barbarians.
(Please don't respond on-list to this waffle.)
