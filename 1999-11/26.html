The technology is becoming available to allow us to use sidereal time so why
don't we?  We adapt to ludicrously large time discrepancies imposed by time
zones created around political boundaries which from a scientific viewpoint
are quite arbitrary (and mobile in some cases).
We could either go to a universal time for convenience or sidereal time for
purity but the current system is total bull$hit.
Surely an orderly society would use one time standard and speak one language
and use just one LINUX kernel at any given time.  I guess GMT will never be
used universally since the Poms just aren't the force that they used to be.

	But it's better than in the old days.
	The US used to have local sidereal time at most
	cities. So when trains started connecting up the cities,
	they found that the clocks gradually changed a few
	minutes at a time across the country. Each town differed
	by a few minutes from its neighbours.

	What surprises me is that the US is so advanced in so many
	technological areas, and yet they still have
	miles, ounces, fahrenheit and so forth, and highly
	individualistic time zones.

	Australia has just a couple of little towns (e.g. in
	WA) which differ from their state time zones.
	So jut be grateful that you live in such an orderly society!!!
