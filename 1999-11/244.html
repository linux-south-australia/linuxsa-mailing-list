I think Kirsty's problem sounds more like APM stuff to me.
Kirsty: Can you check whether you have the kernel console-blanking
enabled?
Also can you check what your BIOS power management settings are set to.
It may be that one or the other is blanking off your screen, but then
somehow not managing to re-enable it.
What happens at the console if you try to swap between VTs by doing the
alt-f1, alt-f2, etc. key combinations?

&gt; &gt; Hi all
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is not a problem I've come across before so I was wondering if someone
&gt; &gt; could put me in the right direction.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Basically, whilst at the console of my machine (standard Red Hat 6.0 on a
&gt; &gt; Pentium 100, 32Mb RAM with a couple SCSI drives) on boot-up, I can log on
&gt; &gt; and do what I need to do at the console.  However, when the machine has
&gt; &gt; been left running for a while, I lose control of the console.  I can access
&gt; &gt; the virtual terminals and still do what I need to do - there doesn't seem
&gt; &gt; to be anything else strange that I can notice, except that the screen just
&gt; &gt; looks at me blankly.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any pointers as to what may be going on would be greatly appreciated...
