could it be that in /etc/resolv.conf there are no entries for your DNS
servers?

to make things quicker, i'd also recomend putting the IP and hostname of
your proxy in the /etc/hosts file.

&gt; Hi Jake,
&gt; 
&gt; I have been following this discusion with interest because I have a similar
&gt; problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I have Red Hat Linux 6.0 setup here at work. My work has a perminant
&gt; internet connection, my problem is that I don't have any name resolution at
&gt; the command prompt (using telnet, ftp , mail etc). When I was running
&gt; Windows NT 4.0 I had a static IP address (which I have transfered to this
&gt; install of linux) and was able to get to the internet without going through
&gt; my works proxy. Now I have to go through the proxy to get out (which is not
&gt; good because not I am restricted by the proxy filter list).
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully I have given you enough info, can you help at all?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Justin

&gt; &gt;  Error = no route to host.
&gt; 
&gt; is this error from linux or a LAN machine?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  If I delete all my settings to the network card things seem ok.
&gt; 
&gt; what do you mean by this? sorry if you are referring to some GUI tool
&gt; that I'm not familiar with, but I would have thought "deleting all
&gt; settings" would be a bad thing :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, am I looking at the gateway address on my network card?
&gt; 
&gt; I dont know, are you? :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Will I need to set up masquerading or is that just for letting other
&gt; &gt; computers connect through mines?
&gt; 
&gt; masquerading is where machine A accepts packets from machines X Y & Z,
&gt; and forwards them on *as if those packets came from machine A*. this way
&gt; machines X Y & Z came share the same modem link on machine A.
&gt; 
&gt; Are you trying to get the LAN to see the 'net using the linux as a
&gt; gateway?
&gt;         if yes:
&gt;                 masquerading.
&gt;         if no:
&gt;                 Are you trying to mantain connections to the LAN whilst you are
&gt; connected to the 'net?
&gt;                 if yes:
&gt;                         pppd may (is) be overwriting your routing table apon connection.
&gt; check man pppd and look for defaultroot
&gt;                 if no:
&gt;                         more info is needed.
