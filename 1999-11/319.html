Mark,

Thanks for that.
I didn't really need to re-start the
name servers since I had done so quite recently to upgrade
to BIND 8.2.2, patch 4, which is supposed to deliver my
PCs from evil from now on.

About nscd, I finally looked at that "d" and thought it
might be a daemon. So I checked with "locate" and found
a binary called "nscd", as you said, and a config <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

=======================================================
/sbin/init.d&gt; more /etc/nscd.conf
#
# /etc/nscd.conf
#
# An example Name Service Cache config file.  This file is needed by nscd.
#
# Legal entries are:
#
[.....]
#       positive-time-to-live   &lt;service&gt; &lt;time in seconds&gt;
#       negative-time-to-live   &lt;service&gt; &lt;time in seconds&gt;
[.....]
        enable-cache            hosts           yes
        positive-time-to-live   hosts           3600
        negative-time-to-live   hosts           20
        suggested-size          hosts           211
        check-files             hosts           yes
=======================================================

This is close to getting at the truth of the matter.
Strangely my Redhat 5.2 hosts don't have any such thing
as "nscd". Maybe that's why they're not so troublesome.

But clearly 3600 seconds is a lot less than the week
that this problem has persisted.

Conclusion: nscd must have a bug in it!!!!!!

So now, I'd like to know who wrote that.

There's no reference to nscd in my bind distribution,
as far as I can see.

It's the "nscd" source I need to look at!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. "man nscd" does nothing on my machines.
