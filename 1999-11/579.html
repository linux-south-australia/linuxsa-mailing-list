Hi,

&gt; &gt; I just thought of the most amusing replacement name for IE 5:
&gt; 
&gt; Without wanting to stifle discussion in any way, I want to register the
&gt; distaste I felt from your joke.  I dislike Microsoft on philosophical
&gt; grounds, and I dislike Windows on aesthetic as well as philosophical
&gt; grounds, but I don't think there is any call for insult.  I know it was
&gt; only a joke; to my way of thinking it was a cheap shot that makes it appear
&gt; that you have no substantive criticism of Windows.  A rule of business
&gt; always worth following--and it applies in life, too--is to not disparage
&gt; your opposition.  You can draw comparisons, particularly unfavourable ones,
&gt; but never bitch.

But I do talk about netscrape, or netrape. It is an term of affection.
Unfortunatley internet expirer is the best I can come up for for ie.

&lt;Don aspesdos jacket&gt;
I do feel that Microsoft come in for some undeserved bagging, puerly upon
its name. I have my opinions on MS the company, their business practices,
and the stability of their products. I also think that MS word is the most
userfriendly and easiest to use word processor out of Word, Word perfect,
and Word Star, for trying all three products, and having to use all three
of them for a while.

I find there is a class of people who bag MS products purely because they
are Microsoft produced, not because of specific features, bugs, or lack of
useability or other reasons.I feel this is wrong. I don't feel that
re-naming is wrong. Look how many anagrams of "emacs" there are. Some of
them are as nasty.

&lt;Climbs down off soap box&gt;

We now return you to your regularly sceduled tech support.

cya
