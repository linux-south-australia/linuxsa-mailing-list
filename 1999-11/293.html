G'day Kevin,

 On 16 November 1999 Parker, Kevin wrote:

 &gt; I seem to vaguely recall something a while ago on this list about people
 &gt; hooking their C64's, or something similar, into Linux boxes.

It's quite possible, and thanks to this ability, development of PPP
for the C64 is coming along fairly well, I'm pleased to report.  :-)

 &gt; Does anyone know if this has been done using TRS80's (Model III's, Model
 &gt; IV's and Model 16's in particular).

This is the info sheet I send to people interested in connectiong
their Commodore computers to a Linux box.  You'll need a null modem
and an ANSI or VT100 terminal program for the TRS80. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Connecting the C64/128 to a Linux computer as a dumb terminal

I use a Turbo232 cartridge connected to the Linux computer via a null
modem connection.  Null modem adapters can be found at any Tandy's,
Radio Shack, or most computer stores. You may also need a gender changer
to connect it together if the plugs don't match.

Note: The following is a quick summary of the 'Linux Serial HOWTO',
      chapter 8 ("How Do I Set Up A Terminal Connected To My PC?")

Within Linux, as root, edit /etc/gettydefs

Find the lines near the top starting like:
  DT&lt;baudrate&gt;..........

Look for a line with DTxxxx where xxxx is the baud rate you want to use.
If one exists already, then skip down to editing /etc/inittab.

Copy one of the 'DT' entries (DT = Dumb Terminal) and ensure that ALL
the numbers (including the last one) are the same as the baud rate of
your C64/128 term program (EG, DT38400 or DT115200). You're just
making an appropriate config line for your terminal speed. If you use
hardware flow control, you will need to add the flag "CRTSCTS" to the
line. For example, the following is a 2400bps entry with h/w flow control:
DT2400# B2400 CS8 CLOCAL # B2400 SANE CRTSCTS CLOCAL #@S @B login: #DT2400
 Save the file. 

Edit /etc/inittab
Down near the bottom, you'll see a row of lines with the heading 
"# Run gettys in standard run levels" after the last one (probably
"6:2345:respawn...."), add one that looks like this: 

S1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty ttyS1 DT115200 vt100

This example is for Com Port 2. If your null-modem connection is using
Com Port one, change the line to "S0.........ttyS0...." or S2 and
ttyS2 for Com Port 3, etc.  

The "DT115200" text should be the same as your baud rate for your C=
term program. If you use 38400, change DT115200 to DT38400. The last part
(vt100) is the default terminal emulation. Save the file.

With the C= connected to the Linux computer via null modem run a VT100
term program such as Novaterm, Desterm or Dialogue, make sure it's at
the same baud rate as you've set in the /etc/inittab and
/etc/gettydefs files.

Type "/sbin/init q" on the server (to reset the inittab file), and
watch the 128's screen. You'll be prompted for a login name and then
password. Your C= is now connect to the Linux box as a dumb terminal!

If you want to be able to login as root from the C64/128 (via shell)
you'll have to add TTYS1 (or your serial port equivalent) to the
/etc/securetty file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There's also a section on SLIP that I can send if it's needed.  



Cheers,
Gaelyne
