 &gt; 
 &gt; Not too wierd, the thing that lsof does is trawl all through system
 &gt; references to filesystems, processes, networking and such.  So if it is
 &gt; run against a kernel that it hasn't been built against, then there may be
 &gt; quite a few required system calls that may not be friendly.

It's worse than that - system calls aren't the problem, it's the layout
of internal system datastructures.

If there's a struct in the kernel it wants to examine which looks like
this:

       struct {
          pid_t   f_pid;
          void    *f_acl;
       } futz;

then it'll expect to see the "f_acl" pointer at an offset of +2 from 
the beginning of each instance of the structure it finds (because the
preceeding element, the pid_t, is 2 bytes long).

If, in a later version of the kernel, someone has changed the "futz"
structure to look like this:

       struct {
          pid_t   f_pid;
          uid_t   f_uid;
          void    *f_acl;
       } futz;

... then lsof will see garbage (which consists of two bytes of uid_t
and 6 bytes of a pointer) when it tries to access the value at offset +2
(which will have been compiled in, based on the contents of the include
files which match the current kernel at the time it was compiled).

Additionally, if there are an array of futz structures and it's walking
through them by saying "futzpointer += sizeof(struct futz)", it'll 
increment by the wrong number of bytes when it tries to find the next
entry in the array because the running kernel's futz structure is longer
than the one that was compiled-in.

This is why you often need to compile utilities like ps, netstat, vmstat,
etc when you upgrade your kernel.

     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
