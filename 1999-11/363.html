Sigh,

I have seen this problem lots.

Samba 2.0.0+ defaults to security=user, which means you need aa valid
username and password on the Samba server when you log into Windows.  You
may also be tripping over the Encrypted password problem as well.

Two choices:

1. Set up a valid user and password and use encrypted passwords or run the
plaintext password registry hack

2. Set your server into security=share

&gt;Hope that somebody will reply to my problem.
&gt;
&gt;I also have here the copy of my smb.conf please try to have a comment on
&gt;this file.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;# /etc/smb.conf
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
&gt;# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
&gt;# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options (perhaps too
&gt;# many!) most of which are not shown in this example
&gt;#
&gt;# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash) 
&gt;# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
&gt;# for commentry and a ; for parts of the config file that you
&gt;# may wish to enable
&gt;#
&gt;# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command "testparm"
&gt;# to check that you have not many any basic syntactic errors. 
&gt;#
&gt;#======================= Global Settings
=====================================
&gt;[global]
&gt;
&gt;# workgroup = NT-Domain-Name or Workgroup-Name
&gt;   workgroup = WORLDLINK
&gt;
&gt;# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
&gt;   server string = Samba Server
&gt;
&gt;# This option is important for security. It allows you to restrict
&gt;# connections to machines which are on your local network. The
&gt;# following example restricts access to two C class networks and
&gt;# the "loopback" interface. For more examples of the syntax see
&gt;# the smb.conf man page
&gt;;   hosts allow = 192.168.1. 192.168.2. 127.
&gt;
&gt;# if you want to automatically load your printer list rather
&gt;# than setting them up individually then you'll need this

&gt;# It should not be necessary to spell out the print system type unless
&gt;# yours is non-standard. Currently supported print systems include:

&gt;# Put a capping on the size of the log files (in Kb).
&gt;   max log size = 50

&gt;# Security mode. Most people will want user level security. See
&gt;# security_level.txt for details.

&gt;# You may wish to use password encryption. Please read
&gt;# ENCRYPTION..txt, Win95.txt and WinNT.txt in the Samba documentation.
&gt;# Do not enable this option unless you have read those documents
&gt;  encrypt passwords = yes
&gt;  smb passwd file = /etc/smbpasswd
&gt;  update encrypted = yes
&gt;
&gt;# The following are needed to allow password changing from Windows to
&gt;# update the Linux sytsem password also.
&gt;# NOTE: Use these with 'encrypt passwords' and 'smb passwd file' above.
&gt;# NOTE2: You do NOT need these to allow workstations to change only
&gt;#        the encrypted SMB passwords. They allow the Unix password
&gt;#        to be kept in sync with the SMB password.
&gt;  unix password sync = Yes
&gt;  passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
&gt;  passwd chat = *New*UNIX*password* %n\n *ReType*new*UNIX*password* %n\n
*passwd:*all*authentication*tokens*updated*successfully*
&gt;
&gt;# Unix users can map to different SMB User names
&gt;  username map = /etc/smbusers
&gt;
&gt;# Using the following line enables you to customise your configuration
&gt;# on a per machine basis. The %m gets replaced with the netbios name
&gt;# of the machine that is connecting
&gt;;   include = /etc/smb.conf.%m
&gt;
&gt;# Most people will find that this option gives better performance.
&gt;# See speed.txt and the manual pages for details
&gt;   socket options = TCP_NODELAY 
&gt;
&gt;# Configure Samba to use multiple interfaces
&gt;# If you have multiple network interfaces then you must list them
&gt;# here. See the man page for details.
&gt;;   interfaces = 192.168.12.2/24 192.168.13.2/24 
&gt;
&gt;# Configure remote browse list synchronisation here
&gt;#  request announcement to, or browse list sync from:

&gt;;   remote browse sync = 192.168.3.25 192.168.5.255

&gt;# Browser Control Options:
&gt;# set local master to no if you don't want Samba to become a master
&gt;# browser on your network. Otherwise the normal election rules apply
&gt;;   local master = no
&gt;
&gt;# OS Level determines the precedence of this server in master browser
&gt;# elections. The default value should be reasonable
&gt;;   os level = 33
&gt;
&gt;# Domain Master specifies Samba to be the Domain Master Browser. This
&gt;# allows Samba to collate browse lists between subnets. Don't use this
&gt;# if you already have a Windows NT domain controller doing this job
&gt;;   domain master = yes 
&gt;
&gt;# Preferred Master causes Samba to force a local browser election on startup
&gt;# and gives it a slightly higher chance of winning the election
&gt;;   preferred master = yes
&gt;
&gt;# Use only if you have an NT server on your network that has been
&gt;# configured at install time to be a primary domain controller.
&gt;;   domain controller = &lt;NT-Domain-Controller-SMBName&gt;

&gt;# Enable this if you want Samba to be a domain logon server for 
&gt;# Windows95 workstations. 
&gt;;   domain logons = yes

&gt;# if you enable domain logons then you may want a per-machine or
&gt;# per user logon script
&gt;# run a specific logon batch file per workstation (machine)
&gt;;   logon script = %m.bat
&gt;# run a specific logon batch file per username
&gt;;   logon script = %U.bat
&gt;
&gt;# Where to store roving profiles (only for Win95 and WinNT)
&gt;#        %L substitutes for this servers netbios name, %U is username
&gt;#        You must uncomment the [Profiles] share below
&gt;;   logon path = \\%L\Profiles\%U
&gt;
&gt;# All NetBIOS names must be resolved to IP Addresses
&gt;# 'Name Resolve Order' allows the named resolution mechanism to be specified
&gt;# the default order is "host lmhosts wins bcast". "host" means use the unix
&gt;# system gethostbyname() function call that will use either /etc/hosts OR
&gt;# DNS or NIS depending on the settings of /etc/host.config,
/etc/nsswitch.conf
&gt;# and the /etc/resolv.conf file. "host" therefore is system configuration
&gt;# dependant. This parameter is most often of use to prevent DNS lookups
&gt;# in order to resolve NetBIOS names to IP Addresses. Use with care!
&gt;# The example below excludes use of name resolution for machines that are NOT
&gt;# on the local network segment
&gt;# - OR - are not deliberately to be known via lmhosts or via WINS.
&gt;; name resolve order = wins lmhosts bcast
&gt;
&gt;# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:

&gt;#	Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
&gt;;   wins server = w.x.y.z
&gt;
&gt;# WINS Proxy - Tells Samba to answer name resolution queries on
&gt;# behalf of a non WINS capable client, for this to work there must be
&gt;# at least one	WINS Server on the network. The default is NO.
&gt;;   wins proxy = yes
&gt;
&gt;# DNS Proxy - tells Samba whether or not to try to resolve NetBIOS names
&gt;# via DNS nslookups. The built-in default for versions 1.9.17 is yes,
&gt;# this has been changed in version 1.9.18 to no.
&gt;   dns proxy = yes

&gt;# Case Preservation can be handy - system default is _no_
