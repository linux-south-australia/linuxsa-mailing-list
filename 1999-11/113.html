Hi,

Last night I was playing around a bit with my LAN, and decided to give a
shot at using NIS (so all computers have the same user names/passwords).
Anyway, all went well (i hope) with the help of the NIS HOWTO, but I just
realised that the ypserv processes are taking up all the idle time of the
processor.

Is this normal (i don't see why it would be)? What could be possible
problems?

The server is on a P133, running RH 6.0, but with a few rpms from the 6.1
CD. I updated the ypserv, ypbind and yp-tools packages, as well as glibc and
libc (and quite a few others, but I don't they have anything to do with
NIS).

Also, when setting it up, /var/yp/Makefile looked for a /etc/gshadow (and
/etc/group) to make the groups database, however, gshadow doesn't exist on
my system. I ended up copying group to gshadow, and it works, but I don't
know if this is a good solution. Finally, it looked for a /etc/netgroups
file, for some reason, and that file didn't exist. I did a touch
/etc/netgroups, and now the yp Makefile completes successfully, but I don't
know if that file is important.

thanks,
Andy
