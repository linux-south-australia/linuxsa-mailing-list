&gt; &gt; One question regarding squid's ACL 'thing', if the 'policy' has to be
&gt; &gt; written in the squid.conf, could it be changed (ie rooms given access
then
&gt; &gt; being denyed access a short time later) without having to restart squid?
&gt;
&gt; You can have squid reload its configuration without restarting it.  Squid
&gt; also has an authentication scheme which uses an external process, but
&gt; I'm not sure how applicable it would be to your scenario.

Perhaps have a look at the squid web site and FAQ, Matt - the site looks
kinda new, too :)  It's at <A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/">http://www.squid-cache.org/</A> .  Also take the time
to appreciate the spectacular Squid logo.  It's gorgeous :-)

<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ-10.html">http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ-10.html</A> is probably tha FAQ to see..
otherwise check the manual for advanced ACL configuration.

It's possible, even, that you won't need to make squid reload its
configuration, which would be a kinda messy way to do things :/

You may need to get hold of a clever authentication program for squid, too -
one that perhaps authenticates proxy users based on their group?  Or based
on their hostname?  - you could name the PCs in the computer rooms
*.cr1.localdomain, *.cr2.localdomain, *.cr3.localdomain..   use dhcp and MAC
addresses and things to do it that way.

There are lots of solutions to this one - just trying to pick the best one
is tricky ;)

IMO, because you want certain groups of COMPUTERS and not USERS access to
the proxy, having some sort of squid ACL based on hostname is probably the
best idea.  Also set up dhcpd if you haven't already :o)

&gt; &gt; Also, would it be possible to have each room on a different 'subnet',
&gt; &gt; while all being physically on the same network, and then just add and
&gt; &gt; remove routes from the 'subnet' to the server?
&gt;
&gt; Personally, an "Access Denied" from the squid server would be "friendlier"
&gt; (?) and easier to diagnose if you have problems than to have your route to
&gt; the server go missing, especially if you were that same server for other
&gt; services (eg, email, samba).

Agreed :)

Good luck - and tell us what you end up doing!
