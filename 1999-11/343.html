Alan,
Call me a freak, but I've managed to get linux going on every system
I've ever tried, including some pretty wierd ones at that.
Remember that although most things aren't listed in the linux kernel
drivers, most things ARE however based on them.
THere's been a couple of times I've needed to hack the source code to
get something to work, but that's 2 times out of hundreds and hundreds
of other times.
(Eg: A BTTV video card used the 848 chipset, but wasn't one of the known
brands in the kernel. I modified a couple of lines in the kernel and it
found it perfectly. THe next kernel revision included it anyway.)

As long as you're not using bleeding-edge devices that don't have
backwards support, linux generally works fine.
However, it would be nice if hardware included a "Works with Linux"
sticker on 'em.
Opensource drivers would be nice too. My TV card works significantly
better under linux than it does in windows with it's native drivers.

Having a "Linux PC Shop" seems to make it sound like linux REQUIRES
special hardware to work.

PS. Ever tried getting non-linux unix to work on strange machines? Makes
linux look easy by comparision.

&gt; According to the oceania web page, you're in
&gt; Port Macquarie, NSW.
&gt; 
&gt; This just emphasizes the lack of linux
&gt; stores in Adelaide.
&gt; I think that for decades, Adelaide and Perth
&gt; have been regarded as country towns by the
&gt; eastern states.
&gt; No matter what the reality is, it is still the
&gt; way that people think.
&gt; This is only a broadbrush view, of course.
&gt; 
&gt; I have often stated that if a PC store in
&gt; Adelaide renamed itself to "Linux Adelaide"
&gt; or "Linux PC Adelaide" or something like that,
&gt; then they would have excellent prospects
&gt; for the next 10 years.
&gt; Of course, dual boot PCs could be a speciality.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if PC stores actually make a
&gt; good profit. I imagine that it's a dog eat dog
&gt; business with lots of marginal operations.
&gt; But by dominating a single niche like linux
&gt; within our little country town, maybe a real
&gt; success could be made of it.
&gt; 
&gt; More than anything, I _wanted_ to find a
&gt; linux PC store in Adelaide for the last 12 months.
&gt; I wasted huge amounts of valuable time doing
&gt; all of my own research into what works with linux
&gt; and what doesn't.
&gt; Unlike the (legacy) MS OS situation, hardware
&gt; suppliers are not yet providing a little
&gt; floppy disk or CD with drivers for their hardware.
&gt; 
&gt; I still assert that adopting linux for one's home
&gt; PC requires courage and stamina.
&gt; A PC shop that it is going to specialize in
&gt; linux in Adelaide should do well.
&gt; 
&gt; Q1:     What is the experience interstate?
&gt;         Are there shops in the eastern states
&gt;         (or Perth) which make linux a primary
&gt;         aspect of their publicity and advertising,
&gt;         or part of their business name?
&gt;         If so, do they get lots of linux customers,
&gt;         and do they get good business from that?
&gt; 
&gt; Q2:     Are there any stores in our sleepy country
&gt;         town of Adelaide which do this? I.e. are
&gt;         there any which state in advertising etc.
&gt;         that they provide linux-friendly hardware?
&gt; 
&gt; I think a problem with this, and which has been
&gt; expressed to me often, is that there's no money in
&gt; it, basically because linux users want everything for
&gt; nothing, and time is money. If someone needs a problem
&gt; dealt with in a legacy OS, you sell them more stuff
&gt; (hardware and/or software). If your customer has a linux
&gt; PC problem, you spend hours advising them, and then they
&gt; go out and get the solution free on the net.
&gt; 
&gt; The only hope for a "linux PC shop" would be that
&gt; a linux specialist could, at least initially, get
&gt; good business out of selling hardware to a niche
&gt; that no one else can service.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that over the next 10 years, linux should
&gt; grow very quickly. Everyone on this list probably
&gt; believes this. But no one in Adelaide believes in it
&gt; enough to bet their house on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe in the next 12 months, someone _will_ bet their
&gt; house on it, and open "Linux Adelaide", a PC shop
&gt; with staff wearing penguin suits, etc. etc. etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm. Thinks: "Must develop terser literary style."
&gt; 
&gt; Cheerio,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt; 
&gt; PS.  I almost certainly need to buy a laptop
&gt; in the next week or two, and I want to put linux
&gt; on it, and it has to be set up as a business computer,
&gt; which means that it must be able to create
&gt; and use MS-format documents and presentation slides.
&gt; Where on earth do I go to get this?
&gt; I can't afford to spend another 6 months researching
&gt; this. Time is money. Where is the "linux laptop shop"
&gt; in Adelaide where I can get this?
&gt; Maybe I have to look interstate??!
