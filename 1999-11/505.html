&gt; &gt; I get the following message when I try to start Netscape -
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Netscape has detected a /root/.netscape/lock file. This may indicate another

&gt; &gt; on localhost under process ID 522.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The message goes on to say you can use netscape but not the cache or delete the
&gt; &gt; lock file.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm logged in as root but I can't delete the file/directory. In Kfm it shows up
&gt; &gt; with the symbol of a locked directory.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; it's probably telling you the truth. You might have made the classic and simple
&gt; mistake of double clicking the netscape icon (thereby attempting to run two),
&gt; or, depending on the distro you're using (KDE ?) it restores previously running
&gt; programs on boot.
&gt; 
&gt; from a console type in
&gt; 
&gt; ps xa | grep scape
&gt; 
&gt; if you get ANY response, then yes, a netscape is running and no, you can't
&gt; delete the lock(ed) file.

Um, the lock "file" is not "locked" by any program. All it consists of is
a symbolic link, which points to a entity that does not exist in reality.
You can easily  delete the file, as pointed out by other people, by just
running a console or xterm, and performing a 'rm /root/.netscape/lock'.

----
Note:
If you do an 'ls -l' on the lock file you will get something like the
following output:

  lrwxrwxrwx   1 aaharwoo csh  19 Nov 24 12:13 lock -&gt; 192.168.8.226:26700

which contains the ip address and pid of the netscape process that created
the lock "file".
----

&gt; to wipe out THAT netscape do the following
&gt; 
&gt; kill -s SIGKILL  &lt;pid&gt;

Or, if it's got a window open, just close it :)

Apple and Microsoft working together in harmony? I'd like to see that.
