Thanks David and Phil for you're suggestions.  I have now been able to 
successfully start an Xvnc session manually, and put an xterm in it.  It 
seems that the tag "-auth /root/.Xauthority" that the startup script 
"vncserver" uses when executing Xvnc, is causing the problem.  When it is 
used, an X app can't connect to the server.  I've deleted this file, and 
had it recreate it, and that didn't help.  I've also tried to use "xhost 
+", that doesn't help either.  I don't know if it would have any effect, 
but I've never actually run X at console on this box.

The problem is no longer urgent, because I can once again use VNC, but if 
anyone has a clue as to what might be going on here, or if you know of some 
type of HOW-TO or FAQ that might explain this, I'd definitely appreciate 
it.  Thanks.

-Ed
