the first comment I saw was I hate Redhat, inviting another pointless flame
war about my distro's better 'n yours war.

the last comment i saw was newbies. And I took it to mean some distros are
good enough for them but not for real users.

And David,  I am not aware of flaming you at any time, nor do i do it
regularly, and Phil, yes, I can indeed be a very rude bastard.

So. Did I go overboard? Probably. Did I misread you? Probably. For
that an apology. I have seen many pointless and destructive flame wars on
many user groups over a couple of years now, all to do with how much better
BSD is than anything else (pick a distro).  As if it matters. 

For the record, I have had no end of troubles installing RH on some
machines.

While perhaps I should have kept my mouth shut please see my irritation
in that context. If we've all said enough now, I would like to drop it.

Phil, thank you for your private, and constructive comments.
