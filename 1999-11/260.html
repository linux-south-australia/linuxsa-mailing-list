Matt,

You said:
=========================================================
Bring as much as you can to ensure that your system will operate, unfortunately
we can't guarantee that we will have any sort of equipment available that will
be compatible with your system.  
=========================================================

1. Of course that's right.
But where do you leave all that costly hardware while having
pizza afterwards?

2. On a related note, if I bring in my Sharp Mobilon HC-4500A
hand-held PC, could someone help me install linux on it?

3. On a more serious note, I might have to nip over to Europe
some time soon, and maybe even show a few slides to people in suits.
For this, one usually lugs along the company PC with MicroSchrott
software. (That's German for Micro-trash, but it loses something in
the translation. A German guy I know uses that term.)

Serious question:
Suppose I want to spend about A$3000 or so on a laptop to
put linux on, which type should I buy?
Should I get a Toshiba like everybody else?
Or are there better options?

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.

==============================================================
PS.  I've collated about half of all the material I generated
while building my own linux PC a few months ago with the
assistance of people on this list. I've written it all down
in web pages on my web site, but it's not ready for
anyone to use yet. The result was an excellent sort of PC,
and I learned heaps about what goes with what.
Maybe I'll have to do the same thing with lap-tops now!

PPS. Please do not reply to questions 1 and 2.
They're just part of my literary idiom.
