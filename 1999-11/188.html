Hi!

I recently purchased an Olympic Technologies CDRW (24/4/2). It works
fine under Windows and I have just managed to successfully burn a backup
image of my /usr/local. Consulting the CD Writing HOWTO here are the
steps I attempted:

1) I compiled SCSI support and IDE as SCSI support into my kernel
2) I added to conf.modules:
	alias scd0 sr_mod
	alias scsi_hostadaptor ide-scsi
	options ignore=hdc

For those who don't know, CDRECORD requires you to work the CDRW device
as SCSI. Part two flatly refuses to function. I readjusted my fstab and
did all sorts of wierd and wonderful methods to convince it to. I tried:

* mount -t [blah] /dev/scd[x] /mnt/rw
* cdrecord -scanbus

Neither of which produced a sensible result. They either failed outright
or reported no bus at all. In desperation I went to
/lib/modules/2.2.5-15/scsi/ and did an insmod sr_mod; insmod ide-scsi.
The next time I attempted cdrecord -scanbus it reported my CDRW drive
perfectly.I then managed to burn a CD image.

However, the SCSI emulation has taken over my secondary IDE interface. I
now have to mount both my CD drives as SCSI devices; I don't have a
problem with this except I've kludged things a little by adding the
line:

* insmod /lib/modules/2.2.5-15/scsi/ide-scsi.o

To my /etc/local/rc.d/rc.local file. I have a number of questions:

1) What am I doing wrong in conf.modules which would stop kerneld from
loading my SCSI emulation dynamically?

2) How come when I manually insmod the ide-scsi emulation it hijacks my
whole secondary IDE interface?
