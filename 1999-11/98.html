Subject: Re: Daylight Savings Time


&gt; &gt; Basically tho, I agree with the sentiment here, if it weren't for
&gt; &gt; some (potential) computer glitches, 2000 will just be another year
&gt; &gt; for me. Now if I wanted to I could open the argument about 2000 vs
&gt; &gt; 2001 being the start of the new millenium :P
&gt;
&gt; I have a convenient method to justify the consuption of great
&gt; quantities of alcohol at the 31st of December this year that linux
&gt; enthusiasts (and engineers) might appreciate.
&gt;
&gt; The decision about how much to drink is usually related to the
&gt; significance of the event. Whether you opt for 2000 or 2001 depends
&gt; on whether you start counting at the year '0' or the year '1'. (Both
&gt; these years are fairly arbitrary, because the calender was devised after
&gt; the event.) Purists would argue that the first year is defined as '1',
&gt; but engineers may argue that the first year should be '0'.
&gt;
&gt; Basically if you refer to the first PC serial device as 'com1' then
&gt; you get drunk on 2001, if you refer to it as 'ttyS0' then you get
&gt; drunk on 2000.
&gt;
&gt; This is also a cool way to alienate windows users.
&gt;
&gt; It's so much more logical to start at '0', especailly if at the year
&gt; was decided on after the event. This means there would have been none
&gt; of the problems associated with living in a year you can't divide
&gt; anything by, since no-one actually knew at the time that it _was_ the
&gt; year '0' (or '1'). (I'm not sure why you'd want to do that, or even
&gt; why I mentioned it.)
&gt;
&gt; So if you get drawn into an argument about why you're celebrating "the
&gt; new milennium", then just point and laugh and say "windows user", and
&gt; get back to your coopers premium.
&gt;
&gt; Oh yeah, 2000 is a much more interesting looking number too!
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
&gt; Alex!
&gt;
&gt; P.S. it goes without saying that this e-mail contains little accuracy
&gt; and much arm-waving and bending-of-fact, but that's what's going to
&gt; count in an argument at 10:00+ on the 31st.
