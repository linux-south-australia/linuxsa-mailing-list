&gt; Matt,
&gt; 
&gt; Yet another sysadmin tool for me to learn!

A few tools that make file really simple (and a lot easier to learn).

	locate - run every night (after an initial run), gives you 
		the location of files on your system.  It is the
		same as a 'find . | grep portmap'.

	rpm - Take a file from above and get the package.  Doing
		a 'rpm -qf /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/K89portmap' would yield
		portmap-4.0-15.   Then doing a 'rpm -ql portmap' 
		yields all the files, applications and just about
		everything else that the package contains.  And
		then of course 'rpm -qa | grep port', yeilds other
		information that may be useful.
		
		Of course this is for a RPM based system, dpkg based
		systems (and even solaris through pkginfo) have similar 
		mechanisms.

	man - More importantly 'man -k' or 'apropros' on some systems.
		'man -k rpc' yeilds lots of starting places that you
		can dig around.

My total feeling is a good sysadmin doesn't know all the information
all of the time (well maybe a guru does, but I ain't one of them).  A
good sysadmin knows bits and pieces of lots of systems, but more importantly
knows how to string them together to get a real picture of what is going on.

&gt; So I tried "rpcinfo" on a few machines, and was
&gt; amazed to find that NFS is always the same
&gt; (port 2049), but mountd is all over the place.
&gt; 
&gt;     100005    1   udp    752  mountd
&gt;     100005    2   udp    752  mountd
&gt;     100005    1   tcp    755  mountd
&gt;     100005    2   tcp    755  mountd
&gt;     100003    2   udp   2049  nfs
&gt;     100003    2   tcp   2049  nfs
&gt; 
&gt; Do you happen to know if these ports are
&gt; dynamically allocated?

I believe they are, but there are 'preferences'.  So it would probably
be more so 'give me this port, otherwise give me any port.'  (Paraphrasing
mark, who posted a somewhat shorter message while I was composing this one.).

&gt; If so, then it's pretty difficult to
&gt; firewall/filter them out.

Now we are moving into areas that I don't have complete understanding of.

The RPC (remote procedure call) system (of Sun lineage) is what gives us
our protocols of NFS, MOUNTD and a swag of other ones.  The general 
procedure is

	1) Work out what service you want to call.
	2) Work out what version you want to call.
	3) Work out what sort of connection you want to call (connection
		oriented, or connectionless).

	4) Contact the portmapper giving those three bits of
		information.
	5) The portmapper will respond with the appropriate port for
		you to connect to.

	6) Do your RPC stuff.

Hence the rpcinfo command talks directly to the 'portmapper' to resolve
things from one addressing scheme to another.  The flipside of course is
that for bad people, the portmap gives a *very* convenient directory of
what RPC servers are running on your machine. 

An aside here, can be when I checked my ISP at one time with a fairly
benign 'rpcinfo -p &lt;isp_server&gt;', nsfd and mountd turned out to be running
on that machine.  An equally benign 'showmount -e &lt;isp_server&gt; yeilded
that the entire '/' directory and below was open *READ* and *WRITE* to
everybody.  I mounted it, created a test file to confirm the status and
then ever so quickly emailed the ISP (who I knew the manager) and told him.

The response had some colourful language in it, not directed at me, but 
directed at how it got configured that way.  Anyway, needless to say
it was fixed pretty quickly.

Now this gets me onto one final point on this post.

	SECURITY should always be RESTRICTIVE - block everything and
		only allow things that you do know are fine.  This is
		a principle, not an instruction.

	To implement this, look at both your machines configuration
		*AND* your firewall.  

For your machines, turn of all extra services you don't want (through
inetd.conf, 'netstat -a', and controlling init scripts.

For you firewall, block everything unless you know what it does.

There is also the possibility of locking down your network at each
machine.  This can be done through 'tcpwrappers' and local input and output
firewall rules (as opposed to forward rules on a firewall).  portmap
as defined by a RH 6.0 man page has tcpwrappers compiled in.

Of course security is also a sliding scale, so if understand the
issues, understand the risks, and understand the possible consequences,
a mid road can be followed.

But it is *VERY* dangerous to lock down things as they get *HACKED* or
*PROBED*.  If you know what you are doing, or you are leaving things
open for a reason, then I guess that is the mid road again.

In reality, nuff said.  Good luck!

Regards,

Matt
