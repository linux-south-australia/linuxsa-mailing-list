&gt; &gt; A handy idea - if you're in need of a working monitor for your servers
&gt; &gt; during a power failure - invest in a monitor/keyboard/mouse switch.
&gt; &gt; That way you can plug it and a single monitor into the UPS for all x
&gt; &gt; computers and have only one monitor sucking on the power.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Long live monitor/keyboard/mouse switches.
&gt;
&gt; You might find the `serial console' kernel option and running
&gt; RS-232 cables to an ancient PC is cheaper.  This also allows
&gt; logging of all console messages to a file.
&gt;
&gt; You don't need to run X on the PC, just use Ctrl-Alt-Fn to change
&gt; screens.  You can cut and paste using text mode mouse.  You can
&gt; also direct all the messages from all the ports to a single
&gt; screen.  This sounds bizaare, but is actually useful when you
&gt; are interested more that a new console message hsa been generated
&gt; on any of the machines, and can then Ctrl-Alt-Fn to see the detail.
&gt;
&gt; Not that I want to knock keyboard/monitor switches.  They are
&gt; independent of OS and you can really stack hardware into a
&gt; 24in rack.  Do any of them change to the screen that is
&gt; currently outputing messages?

[veers slightly off topic..]

I doubt it.  I very muchly doubt it.  What if more than one screen displayed
a message?  Possibly a better idea is to use syslogd over a network and have
all the boxes logging to one log server.  Just make sure your network gear
is UPS'd :)

Now if only I could make dhcpd configure that..  ;(

Unfortunately at the moment I have windows NT machines needing to share with
a SCO-UNIX machine - NT and text output?  lol.  Funny stuff.

I especially like the error message I got the other day on the screen -
something like "The System Log File is Full".  That didn't mean that the
disk was full - just that the log file had reached its maximum size.
Nothing gets logged after that.  The message had appeared in the middle of
the night on Friday, it seems, so two days' logging was lost.  I also like
the way you have to explicitly turn ON logging for things like invalid logon
attempts and other security-type events.

I hate that I know those things :(

I can't WAIT for samba to do full "domain" control..  then I can finally run
these decent servers properly with a good OS.

Wow, is that the time?  Nite everyone.
