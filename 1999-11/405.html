&gt; &gt; I have been using Applixware 4.3.7 for some time now.

&gt; Does it run on FreeBSD?  It's a serious question.  I am opposed to Windows
&gt; for philisophical reasons, namely that it restricts my choices of computing
&gt; platforms more than I am willing to accept.  Obviously I want a great word
&gt; processor, and I would be delighted to use Microsoft Office for Unix, if it
&gt; was available.  My two priorities are for a great word processor and a
&gt; choice in OS.  (I presume it does run on FreeBSD, most Linux things do.)

Two things come to mind... 

First, linux executables are supported to some extent on FreeBSD, from
memory. To what extent I can't tell you. I am sure there is an
authoritative source close-ish to hand though. 

Second, on www.applix.com "
                       Recent News:
...
                      Applix and Walnut Creek Partner to Provide
Applixware Office for FreeBSD Operating System"

So I guess that's a yes. Netcraft are local Applix re-sellers, I would
ring Tique or Geoffrey. I bought my old version there, the service is
good in my opinion.

I am happy with the functionality provided in Applixware, as compared
with MS Orrifice which I use at work. I am not a demanding user. If
there are specific things a WP must do for your use it would be wise to
check those requirements out before handing over the readies.

Cheers,

Bruce
