&gt; &gt; Whether you opt for 2000 or 2001 depends on whether you start counting at

&gt; &gt; the first year is defined as '1', but engineers may argue that the first
&gt; &gt; year should be '0'.

&gt; Should, shmood.  The first year of the calendar is the first year of the
&gt; calendar.  It's not as we have a choice in the matter.  (The calendar was
&gt; designed to start at year 1.)

It would have been different if there had been more engineers around
then, and almost certainly would have been different if they drank
beer.

You'd have a whole bunch of people going, "Don't do it that way, it's
illogical, and it means we'll be celebrating new milleniums and
centuries on stupid days."

The pope should have written an rfc.
