I agree - floppies should not even be a "last resort". Maybe I'm just
unlucky, but generally in a box of 10 disks, one or more is bad to start
with, and the rest usually seem to fail to hold data for more than
rand()*42 minutes.

I made a boot disk at home the other day, and was booting off it quite a
few times. By about the 8th boot in an hour, it started reporting data
errors. ;P
Either my magnetic personality is acting up, or else floppies are just
an technological dinosaur that deserves to die. 

Multi-session cdroms are the way to go. ;)
You can boot 'em, you can store a lot more data on 'em, they've got a
decent transfer rate, and when you don't want them anymore, you can even
use them as a frisbee or placemat etc.

&gt; I've always found the concept of *backup-up* onto a floppy slightly
&gt; amusing.
&gt; 
&gt; I trust floppys about as far as I can throw them, which is not ar
&gt; considering they always do that funny flippy-around thing in the air....
