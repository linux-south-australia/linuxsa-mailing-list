Hi,

&gt; Rebooting is such a Microsoft thing to do. Next time use `hostname`
&gt; (`man hostname` for more details).
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, look at the scripts in /etc/rc.d to see what your
&gt; machine is doing at boot time with respect to hostname setting.

Hmm, mental note, don't be in such a hurray next time. It was a "quick
fix".

&gt; On a related note, there are very few problems wth Linux that can be
&gt; 'fixed' by rebooting. It usually just means the machine comes up the
&gt; way it was with the same problem and less means of tracking it. (Not
&gt; to mention it ruins your uptime!)  :o)
&gt; 
&gt; It's a good to get into the habit of forcing yourself never to reboot
&gt; and to work out what the problem is and to solve it without rebooting
&gt; (hardware problems aside). Linux isn't Windows and it can take quite a
&gt; bit of time to get used to the fact that rebooting solves very little.

Yep well prior to re-boot it had 168 days uptime, and that was since
install !!!

&gt; There is nothing quite as satisfying as a machine with a year+ uptime
&gt; and processes (htpd, named, etc) that have been running for months and
&gt; months.

Well apart from this and some glitches, we generally do. Normally power
outages from a flaky transformer ar the things that keep the uptimes down
here !

cya
