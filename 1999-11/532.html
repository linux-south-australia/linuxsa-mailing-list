&gt;&gt; There's a SCO box, and a windows box. I'm trying to get some data from
&gt;&gt; SCO to Windows. I've connected them with Ethernet, and everything seems
&gt;&gt; to work OK, but when I try ftping anything (from SCO to Windows) over
&gt;&gt; ~2k, the ftp just stops. No errors. It just stops part way through.

&gt; A trace from tcpdump or ethereal from a third machine would let you
&gt; know if the receiver is waiting on the sender, or vica-versa (look
&gt; to see if all the data sent has been ACKed).  You shouldn't be seeing
&gt; any failed checksums (you have to calculate this by hand, as ethereal
&gt; doesn't do this yet), or RST or FIN flags.

FWIW, my original email to Richard contained this problem that I'd
seen at two seperate SCO sites, which was that packets approaching
(or exceeding, I can't remember which) the MTU size would be emitted
with extreme brokeness.  The problem turned out to be third-party
drivers in both cases; using a "SCO supported NIC" used a less broken
driver.  I actually can't remember how the packet was broken (from
memory, it may have been a checksum problem), because I normally
keep comprehensive notes on problems like these instead of relying
on my increasingly dodgy memory, and I can't find the notes I made
on this problem :-( (thereby confirming the dodgy memory story :-).

&gt; SCO has
&gt; better instrumentation then Linux, so you should be able to get good error
&gt; counts for the IP and TCP leyers.

It may not show, because the problem is with the packets the SCO box
is sending, not receiving.  Richard, I think you're going to have to
put a small hub in and get something decent to monitor the link,
instead of using an Ethernet crossover.  It'll confirm or deny it
one way or the other.

Regards,
  Daryl Tester
