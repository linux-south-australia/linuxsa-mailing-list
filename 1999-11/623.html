&gt; The pppd binary must be installed with the SUID bit set.

I strongly urge you find a FreeBSD archive and download the complete manual
set.  Linux has appalling documentation; BSD unix has always had good
documenation.  Linux is sufficiently close to unix that the BSD manual will
hold more lessons than surprises.  When you have obtained the BSD manuals,
read them.  They explain security in lucid detail.

SUID means "set user id".  This is part of Unix security, and I hasten to
add that it's something which is frequently misused.

Unix has three security domains.  There is the user who owns a file; there
is the group that has group ownership of a file; and there is everyone
else.

   -rw-r--r-x  1 user  group  64 Nov 19 15:39 some-file

Files are opened for some particular type of access, such as read only,
write only or read and write.  When the file is opened the desired type of
access is stated, and the kernel checks to see if that is permitted.  The
kernel first checks to see what domain to use: if the process that opens
the file was started by the same user that owns the file, then only the
user permissions are inspected.  If the process was started by some other
user, but that user is a member of the group that owns the file, then only
the group permissions are considered.  If the process that opens the file
was started by some other user, and if that user is not a member of the
group that owns the file, then the third security domain determines whether
the access is permitted.

In the case of "some-file", above, "user" can read and/or write the file,
but cannot execute it.  Anyone in group "group" (other than user) can only
read the file; neither write nor execute it.  All other users can read and
execute the file.

The Unix security model permits an executable file to be started with the
same permissions as the user or group that owns the file.

   -rwsr-xr-x  1 user  group  1998 Nov  1 15:00 some-program

All of what I said above, concerning verifying access to the file, holds
true.  In addition, because the desired access is to execute the file two
other elements in the file permission bits have meaning.  (I should say
that execute access can only be requested using the fork system call, and
this does not require read permission.)  Those two bits are the SUID (set
user id) and SGID (set group id) bits.  When a file that has the SUID bit
set is executed, the user who executed it is remembered (the real uid), and
the new process runs effectively (effective uid) as the user that owns the
program file.  The SGID bit is analagous to the SUID bit.

When "some-program" (above) is executed, it runs with an effective user id
of user.  Anybody can run it, and no matter who does so, it always runs
with user's permissions.

To refine the security model that I described above: When a file is opened
for some particular type of access, the kernel first checks to see if the
process is running with the same effective user id as the owner of the
file; and so on.

The intended purpose of SUID and SGID is to permit you to create secure
access to protected data.  For example, you might have a file containing
secrets that your friends tell you, and you might want your friends to be
able to add their own secrets to that file.  You don't want anybody to be
able to change a secret, just to add one, and so you would write a program
that adds a secret to the file.  You would set the SUID bit on the program
file, and deny any access to the file to the group and everyone else, so
that only you could do anything to the file.  When anybody runs your SUID
program, that program accesses the file with the same privileges as you.
Naturally you would take very great care to ensure that the program could
do nothing that you didn't specifically want.  For reasons that are way
to time consuming to go into right now, use of the system() library
routine would almost certainly be a security flaw.

Postscript: pppd probably needs to be run as root, perhaps because it
needs to read and write from the modem, which you might well not permit
"ordinary" users, and perhaps because it manipulates routing tables.

Another fine lesson brought to you by,

David
