Excuse the length of replied section of this post, but your comments are
pertinent, and I would like to back up what you say.  I have 30+ years
experience of writing C only for embedded systems. 

One of the salient features of many embedded projects is an almost total lack
of debugging ability. You simply cannot breakpoint anywhere, and most embedded
applications have no stdio of any kind. The concept of stdout is a little
strange when you're switching traffic lights &lt;grin&gt;.

To get round this, a viable method is to use a standard compiler (such as GNU)
on a standard OS (such as linux) to test the embedded code. Typically, this
involves wrapping the entire project inside (let's say) embedded_main() and
calling it from main(). Everything inside main is #defined out on the embedded
compile except for a single call to embedded_main(). You can then use stderr
and other facilites to debug code.

What is immutable in this picture, is that source code *must* be generic and
standard. Very typically, a manufacturer of chip 'X' supplies a reasonable C
compiler for it. You can be certain, it cannot have, and will never have, the
advanced "lint" type features of GNU. It simply won't and can't find the really
strange gotchas (missing include include include files, wrongly phrased int's
when you meant shorts, etc ad infinitum. Australian Hitech compilers are
perhaps the best crafted embedded compilers in the world. They are badge
engineered in the US so the yanks think they're home grown, they don't lint
very well at all).

In my world, it is imperative to test my embedded C source with a real -world
compiler such as gnu. I WANT the compiler to scream at me, I welcome it
complaining very loudly about void main(void). The original author of this
post, is, i think, missing the whole point of using good syntax to begin with.
The last thing I would want to do, no matter how innocuous it would appear, is
cripple a warning message when my embededd eprom is going to end up on a flight
control system somewhere. They are awfully difficult to fix after the event.

You are also quite correct about void functions being handled differently. In
Hitech's case for HC11's and 68340's it is optimised to jumps, not call subs.
This makes bugger all difference to all functions except main() and exit().
The startup asm code makes wrong assumptions (it sets the stack incorrectly),
and exit() pops the stack to oblivion.

It's a case of shooting the messenger rather than fixing the fault! Fix the
cause of the warning, don't cripple a warning message coz you dont like it.

&gt; &gt; Im currently developing microcontroller progs using a X assembler version of
&gt; &gt; GCC.
&gt; &gt; In this application, the program NEVER stops running (has a while(1) loop
&gt; &gt; inside) so i setup main to be "void main(void)".
&gt; &gt; But of course, GCC doesnt like that and gives a warning saying main should
&gt; &gt; return an int value.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is there a way of disabling this 1 warning message?? It just gets annoying
&gt; &gt; after a while, as im a "make a small change, recompile" type guy :P
&gt; 
&gt; We've discussed this before on this list.  Here's a brief summary:
&gt; 
&gt; - The ANSI standard says that main() must return an int to 
&gt;   be a conforming program.  
&gt; 
&gt; - On some compilers+architectures, a function returning void is 
&gt;   implemented differently to a function returning int, to the point 
&gt;   where the wrong declaration may produce a program that crashes.  
&gt;   main() is no exception.  
&gt; 
&gt; - GCC on Intel is more forgiving of this case, but that's not the 
&gt;   point.  Do not use the compiler's behaviour in any given situation 
&gt;   as a reference when trying to understand what's permitted.   
&gt; 
&gt; - The ANSI Standard is very much your friend.  Do everything you 
&gt;   can to stay within its bounds.  Once you stray into using bizarre 
&gt;   compilers on bizarre architectures (e.g. when developing embedded 
&gt;   code), non-standard code tends to produce really, really obscure 
&gt;   and costly bugs.  
&gt; 
&gt; - The whole Open Source movement is based on code sharing.  Code sharing 
&gt;   is based on conformance to the standard.  (Although, to be fair, GCC 
&gt;   is in many ways a de-facto standard in its own right.)  
&gt; 
&gt; - Stray from the standard only when you have tried extremely hard to 
&gt;   conform, have checked your design and implementation with other 
&gt;   experienced programmers, and am confident that the cost of 
&gt;   writing and maintaining nonstandard code is outweighed by the 
&gt;   benefits of doing so.  In the end, it's an engineering decision.  
&gt; 
&gt; - In this case, there's no cost in declaring the function as returning 
&gt;   int, and adding an (unreached) return 0; statement, and so that is how 
&gt;   you should address this issue.  
&gt; 
&gt; cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Brenton
&gt; 
&gt; ps. If you wanted to suppress a particular warning, you could pipe the 
&gt;     compiler output through a filter like awk, sed or perl, and have the 
&gt;     filter delete the messages that you don't want to see.  But that's 
&gt;     really an action of last resort.
