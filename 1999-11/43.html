&gt; Hi Jake,
&gt; 
&gt; I have been following this discusion with interest because I have a similar
&gt; problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I have Red Hat Linux 6.0 setup here at work. My work has a perminant
&gt; internet connection, my problem is that I don't have any name resolution at
&gt; the command prompt (using telnet, ftp , mail etc). When I was running
&gt; Windows NT 4.0 I had a static IP address (which I have transfered to this
&gt; install of linux) and was able to get to the internet without going through
&gt; my works proxy. Now I have to go through the proxy to get out (which is not
&gt; good because not I am restricted by the proxy filter list).
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully I have given you enough info, can you help at all?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Justin
&gt; 

That is enough infomraiton to start.

Can you post the output of 'netstat -r', but *MAKE SURE* you change the ip
addresses so that you don't give out much about your network.

My guess is that your network is subnetted, when you dialup the default 
route gets changed.  The only real choice you have is adding network routes
for all subnets that you talk to.  But post your *MODIFIED* netstat -r 
output and we will disect it.

If you ips are 192.x.x.x change them to 10.y.z.x or whatever so that they
work.
