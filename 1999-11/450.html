&gt; Last meeting, I recall some discussion about UPS's for Linux. APC have
&gt; one available. Disclaimer: I know nothing about UPS's or APC, and have
&gt; no idea when the was released, and haven't even read the webpage -- I
&gt; just looked at it, and noticed that it ran with Linux, and thought I'd
&gt; forward it...

The powerd daemon is usually used in place of a closed-source
product.

I suggest you run in `dumb' mode rather than the APC's `smart'
mode.  Unless things have changed recently, the `smart' mode
uses an undocumented protocol and the software is broadcast
intensive, with the usual scaling and dial-on-demand problems.

The dumb mode puts voltages out onto the RS232 port.  These can
be trivially amplified and fed all your machines.  powerd is
also much less resource intensive than the smart products,
it just waits on Data Carrier Detect being asserted, then signals
init to bring the machine down.

Sure and simple.


Note that connecting the UPS to the computer often requires a
special cable.  You should make sure that this cable is supplied
with the UPS as some of them are very expensive.


Also be careful to ensure that the UPS is big enough to do the
job.  You probably need it to be able to power three successive
power losses without charge.  You probably need to buy the model
above the $199 entry level model.


The `soft power' systems are also a problem.  They are very nice
in that you can bring the machine down and drop the power from
software.  They are bad in that when the power is reasserted a
lot of machines don't start until the power switch his manually
pressed.


Monitors are also a problem.  In small installations it's probably
best to cable them to *not* use the UPS, as their power consumption
is quite large.  Some desktop UPSs have `filtered only' sockets
that are ideal for monitors, printers and modems.
