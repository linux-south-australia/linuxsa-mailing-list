Hi,

This may be of interest.  I imagine we will see a new round of
'buffer-overflow' style attacks against WinNT mediated via port 139 as a
result of the disclosure of this information.

&gt;
&gt;rfp, thank you very much for reporting this.  i was hoping that someone
&gt;else would spot this sooner or later and be the first to mention it on
&gt;ntbugtraq.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         Interesting on how things go around/come around.
&gt;
&gt;isn't it just? :-)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Recently Luke
&gt;&gt; &gt;Kenneth Casson Leighton posted a message on NTBugtraq in response to SP6
&gt;&gt; &gt;not fixing the LSA denial of service.  He states that this problem is
&gt;&gt; &gt;essentially "due to marshalling/unmarshalling MSRPC code being unable to
&gt;&gt; &gt;cope with a NULL policy handle."  He also states that they reported this
&gt;&gt; &gt;problem to Microsoft around February 1999.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         Well, no, I did not 'rediscover' the LSA denial of service (ala
&gt;&gt; &gt;the AEDebug advisory earlier this month).  I did, however, discover a
&gt;&gt; &gt;different denial of service based out of services.exe.  When sent a
&gt;&gt; &gt;specific packet, it's possible to get srvsvc.dll to choke, and cause
&gt;&gt; &gt;services.exe to reference a bad memory location.  For those geeks in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;crowd, essentially srvsvc_netrshareenum in srvsvc.dll uses
&gt;&gt; &gt;rpcrt4_ndrcomplexstructunmarshall to tweak a string, but returns a NULL.
&gt;&gt; &gt;srvsvc_netrshareenum doesn't check for return value, adds four to the
&gt;&gt; &gt;pointer, and passes it up a function stack until finally that memory is
&gt;&gt; &gt;read (address 00000004).  Blam...Dr. Watson.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         So we have another problem due to marshalling/unmarshalling MSRPC
&gt;&gt; &gt;code.  This was found independantly of Luke's info and the LSA
&gt;&gt; &gt;vulnerability.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;It's hoped that between the services.exe and the lsass.exe denial of
&gt;&gt; &gt;services, both based on bad RPC code, Microsoft will find this problem
&gt;&gt; &gt;worthy of fixing.
&gt;
&gt;ok, seeing as you found and reported this independently, i'm going to take
&gt;that as a green light for me to be able to report what i haven't been able
&gt;to say to anyone outside of microsoft before now.
&gt;
&gt;issues
&gt;------
&gt;
&gt;the MSRPC marshalling code (DCOM) in NT 4.0, all service packs, is very
&gt;badly written.  it is susceptible to all sorts of out-of-bounds issues.
&gt;the areas that are particularly bad are:
&gt;
&gt;- string handling (any MSRPC service where a UNICODE string is sent, and
&gt;that's basically all of them).
&gt;
&gt;- arrays-of-structures handling (for example, an array of shares in
&gt;NetrShareEnum; array of transports in NetrServerTransportEnum; array of
&gt;SIDs in LsarLookupSids (this one may have been fixed in one of the
&gt;hotfixes, now in latest service pack)).
&gt;
&gt;- dynamic-item-count in structures (for example, the number of RIDs in a
&gt;SID is dynamic).
&gt;
&gt;- enumeration-containers (indicating that an info level is going to
&gt;exist, then passing a NULL pointer to the actual structure indicated by
&gt;the info level).
&gt;
&gt;- policy handle management (for example, sending NULL policy handles in
&gt;function calls instead of a previously-obtained policy handle, e.g
&gt;OpenService(NULL, "service name", ...) instead of OpenSCMAN("server",
&gt;&pHnd, ...); OpenService(&pHnd, "service name", ...).
&gt;
&gt;there used to be some issues in Service Pack 1 with the actual MSRPC
&gt;headers themselves, which got fixed (you can anonymously crash NT4 no SP
&gt;by sending garbage MSRPC headers).  there were also some issues to do with
&gt;MSRPC authentication that were fixed in Service Pack 4 (evidence of this
&gt;shown through samba code breaking when SP4 beta RCs were made available
&gt;:-)
&gt;
&gt;consequences
&gt;------------
&gt;
&gt;all of these things have various dire consequences, namely termination of
&gt;services or even overwriting kernel memory in the case of the registry
&gt;service, as that's where the registry MSRPC service is implemented, for
&gt;speed gains.  this results in unpredictable behaviour that will eventually
&gt;result in a blue screen.  fortunately, the registry is not accessible
&gt;remotely without an authenticated user connection.
&gt;
&gt;there may be other MSRPC-based services that are implemented in the
&gt;kernel, for speed gains.  i do not know what they are.
&gt;
&gt;the poor quality of the marshalling / unmarshalling code affects _all_
&gt;MSRPC / DCOM services, including any services written by third party
&gt;developers (as DCOM is MSRPC-based, the code being generated by a MIDL
&gt;compiler).
&gt;
&gt;so, that includes Exchange, SQL, NT printing, NETLOGON, Event Log, srvsvc,
&gt;wkssvc, winreg, winsif, winsadmin, browsess, svcctl, atsvc, samr, lsa.
&gt;
&gt;solution
&gt;--------
&gt;
&gt;there is empirical evidence to show that microsoft has resolved these
&gt;problems at a coding level, however it requires a *TOTAL*, recompile of
&gt;*ALL* MSRPC-based services to use the much-improved MSRPC marshalling /
&gt;unmarshalling code.  plus testing, plus a massive hotfix or series of
&gt;hotfixes or a new service pack.
&gt;
&gt;basically, microsoft is working really hard at fixing / rewriting all of
&gt;these things, and they've done a heck of a lot.  it just hasn't seen the
&gt;light of day, yet, in a released version of NT.
&gt;
&gt;decision
&gt;--------
&gt;
&gt;so, it's up to you, the users of windows nt, to determine whether you
&gt;think this is important enough or not.  do you want NT4 fixed now, with
&gt;the consequences that NT5, which has a _far_ superior MSRPC code-base, may
&gt;be delayed, or do you want to upgrade all your NT4 systems to NT5 when
&gt;it's available?
