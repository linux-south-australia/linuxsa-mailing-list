*throws hat into ring*

is there any reason why www.geekboys.org and geekboys.org *should* have
the same address?  could it be that geekboys.org is just a holding IP
for registration purposes, and www. mail. ns. etc are the actual
machines?

when you <A HREF="telnet:80">telnet:80</A> 'd to geekboys.org you got:
 &lt;HEAD&gt;
  &lt;TITLE&gt;Test Page for Apache Installation on Web Site&lt;/TITLE&gt;
 &lt;/HEAD&gt;


which is the default page from apache. so maybe this boox is configured
for multiple IPs,a nd the default "holding" IP is being served by an
apache that doesn't have any *real* pages in it.

?

&gt; 
&gt; Say what?  I seriously doubt that.  I might even be willing to wager on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Some thoughts:
&gt; 
&gt; Name servers can return different IP addresses for the same domain name
&gt; (assuming that a particular name is configured with multiple addresses),
&gt; and this has become a common way of load balancing.  There could be
&gt; multiple servers with the same name but with different web content.
&gt; 
&gt; Browsers can indicate language preference.  I didn't notice whether you
&gt; said that you got these odd results on a single machine, or from different
&gt; machines.  Obviously if it's the latter case I would suggest you look at
&gt; your language preferences.
