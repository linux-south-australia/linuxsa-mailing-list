&gt; I've just downloaded and installed Corel Linux.

Philosophical ramble follows.  Don't expect it to have any point.

I admire Corel.  They are being genuinely nice people.  They clearly
support the Linux movement through their own distribution, and through
support of WINE, and by making their products available on Linux.  I
suspect that their prime motivation is purely commercial.  They own
WordPerfect, which once was the dominant word processor but is now far, far
second fiddle to Microsoft Word.  Word is clearly the better program (in my
highly experienced opinion), and anyway they can't knock Microsoft out of
first place on Microsoft's own operating system, so it is in their best
interest to try to foster a competing platform.  If that platform wins a
sizeable market share from MS, and if their applications are available on
day one, so to speak, they will do very nicely.

It's a shame that the program is so awful.  I wanted to buy it, I really
did, because I want to support a serious competitor to Microsoft.  I forced
myself to use WP8 for more than long enough, and it just got worse and
worse.  It was a terrible experience for me.  Please, please Corel, ditch
WP8 and start again.

While I'm about it, I admire Sun.  They are being genuinely nice people,
too.  They have always supported the unix community, in fact I think MS
think that Sun is the enemy.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend.  Sun! my
friend!  And they bought Star Office and are now giving it away!  And on
Windows, too!  Whoohoo, way to go.  It probably sounds the death knell for
WP, although Star Office is S--L--O--W.  I think they have actually out
Microsofted Microsoft in the big binary stakes.  I can't decide between
Applixware, which sadly comes with no trial version, and TeX.  Maybe I
should just write in raw PostScript.
