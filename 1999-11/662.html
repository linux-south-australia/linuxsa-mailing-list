&gt; What version of SCO are you using?
&gt; Can you give me a more descriptive explaination of what exactly is not working?
&gt; 

Unfortunately, all I know is that it's fairly old. I'd suggest it is
about 5 years old... It runs on an ACER pentium 133, which I beleive
would have been bought at the same time as the SCO licence...

What isn't working:
Using the 3Com ethernet card, ftp dies at the same point every time,
although changing the ethernet mtu size changes the point where it
dies... NFS hasn't been tried, but someone who knows more than me
suggested it would be the network card, so it wouldn't matter what you
used to transfer stuff -- as soon as the packets get above a certain
size, the ethernet card spits... The ethernet card diagnosis made sense,
as ftp through the loopback device worked 100%, so it wasn't a dud
ftpd... However, tcpdump showed me nothing I could make much sense of...
and I didn't make a copy of the output (der).

I can't install a PCI NE2000 clone that I have because I am not
confident that I would know how to return the system to a stable state
if relinking the kernel killed it... Particularly as the system disks
are nowhere to be found...

Mounting the SCO drive under linux won't work due to the sysv support
not being very good (read:
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/sysv-fs.txt line 25-27) We get
a "bad superblock etc etc etc " error... Note: using fdisk to read the
partition table tells us that the format is "63: GNU HURD or SysV"...

Trying SLIP or PLIP has not been attempted yet due to the lack of an
appropriate cable on site... will be tried RSN... I've never done
anything like this on a Unix, so I don't know what the success rate is
likely to be...

FloppyNet hasn't been tried as it sucks.

TapeNet hasn't been tried as we don't know anything about the tape
format, and don't have another tape drive...

ModemNet was considered, but would take a Long Time on a 14.4K modem...

I think that covers everything...
