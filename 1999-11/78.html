Introduction of what we call standardised daylight savings time began in
the late part of last century as a response to the industrialisation of a region
(not necessarily a country or state), and was and always has been specifically
introduced to conserve power and heating. There is no other reason for it.
Although farming communities have always bellyached about DST, in reality they
have always practised an advanced form of it since we first discovered cows.
They adjust their clocks each day every day to when the sun comes up, not, some
artificial number on a wall.

On Norfolk Island where I come from, it has never existed and never will. We have
quite some trouble keeping up with you guys as to what exactly your current
time really is. The ABC's "7:30 report" is one of our running jokes
