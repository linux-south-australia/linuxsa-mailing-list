on this same note:

I recently had a user complain that he couldn't get his email, it was
saying "the server didn't respond correctly".

The situation was:
	client - Mac laptop running outlook express (just plain weird)
	server - slakware 2.0.0 (*old* but can't replace yet...) running
sendmail

I telnetted into port 110, and logged into his account, and after the
"pass xxxx" command got:

+OK 0 messages ready in /var/spool/blah

then I did "list" and got:
+ERR no messages in mailbox.

which is expected - since the client already knows the mailbox is empty.
I sent him an email from another computer, and logged in again, this
time, "pass xxxx" produced:

+OK 1 messages ready in /var/spool/blah

and "list":
1 102
.

perfectly.


anyway - not a single other person has a problem, so I had to diagnose
that it was the fact the he was running the MAC version of outlook
express. outlook and outlook express on pc have no probs nor do any real
mail client.

thought it might be interesting to see what people thought about the
comment that some software does not play well with others. :)

btw: telnetting into a port 110 and/or 25 is a great way to diagnose
probs ....

&gt; Our mail server is NT running Internet Shopper Ltd's mail server
