Hi all,

&gt; Both the modem and soundcard sections of the phoneblaster work OK.
&gt; But I get all sorts of strange sounds coming from the the speakers as
&gt; though something is writing to the modem or soundcard ports (its a
&gt; voice modem with speakerphone so it can talk out of the soundcard

This really sounds like (pardon the pun) a problem with EM noise from
the system. This is unfortunately all to common with equipment from
Creative/SoundBlaster. They are not exactly known for their DAC and
on-board amps. (Please, no lawsuits this is mearly a personal obsevation
after having used/sold/installed hundreds of their products, although I
will say that it is rare for it to be particularly noticeable.) Make
sure that the sound card/modem is as far away from any high frequency
components, eg, video and SCSI cards as possible. Also if you are using
amplified speakers, make sure they are plugged into the line-out not
spk-out plug.

&gt; It seems to work fine, ie without the strange sounds, with Solaris x86
&gt; using the same settings - thats on the same machine.

This is the bit that has me confused, unless Solaris by default has
better (lower volume) settings for the mixer that as a result prevent
you from hearing the digital noise of the system.

The only cards that I know of that don't pick up any noise even when you
put them right along side your 220MHz video DAC are the Gravis range,
but then you pay for it.

PS. If you havn't realised yet, I know a lot more about hardware than
software... It could always be a software problem but in general they
are harder to find and so I like to rule out H/W probs first. :)
