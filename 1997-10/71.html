&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello sorry about this question, but..
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a Vibra 16 soundcard, I had it working with a Kernal (2.0.30) but
&gt; &gt; &gt; the other day I compiled a new kernal to try to get the midi part working
&gt; &gt; &gt; midid was not working before and now it can't even get a peep from the card.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am wondering what my midi device is on the card (MPU401) or the Yamah
&gt; &gt; &gt; OPL stuff & what i set the mpu401 to as my NE2000 uses 300 & it is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; working at 330.

Is it a PnP card?  Apparrently the upcoming 2.2.x kernels will have PnP support.
Is the driver detected?  If the driver is detected what does it say?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Also i have some error messges taht occour at startup about modules taht
&gt; &gt; &gt; can't be located or are the wrong kernal version or kernal version needed
&gt; &gt; &gt; but cant be found. To compile teh kernal i used..
&gt; &gt; &gt; make dep
&gt; &gt; &gt; make clean
&gt; &gt; &gt; make zImage
&gt; &gt; &gt; make modules
&gt; &gt; &gt; make modules_install

What are the error messages?  Sometimes you need to compile support for 
various things or set up an alias to get it to pick up properly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am also thinking of purchasing a Release of linux on CD any advice as
&gt; &gt; &gt; to which is the better - RED HAT or Slackware and is X12 around the
&gt; &gt; &gt; corner soon?

My personal favourite is Red Hat.  But Slackware should have some points
that shine better than Red Hat.

I am not sure, but I wouldn't expect X12 to be out for a while.  We
are only at X11R6.3 at the moment, and I can't see any radical changes
that would warrant going to another Major Release.
