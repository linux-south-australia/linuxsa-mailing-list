OK, there is really only one thing I would like to add to this and that is
concerning buffered output and "lines".  The problem isn't anywhere near
as bad as was made out, simply because lines are delimited.  Most OS's (I
can't think of one that dosn't, but I'm being conservative) have a newline
character which signals the end of a line.  In fact DOS uses two.  So if
you want to read in the next line you simply read until you reach a LF
('\n') or an EOF (ie it's the last line, and it wasn't terminated).  So
you aren't sent "//usr//bob" but rather "//usr//bob/n" (where // is an
escaped / and /n is an escaped newline).  Therefore if you recieve "//usr"
you know to block until you recieve the rest of the line.  The problem
arises when a process in the pipeline strips, or moves, the newlines.  As
doing such things is normally considered a bug, most programs don't.
