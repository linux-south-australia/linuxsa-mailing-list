&gt; Adaptec talk about Joliet a M$ extension of ISO9660 in their blurb 
&gt; about DirectCD so I tried using the Joliet patches from

&gt; bmrc.berkeley.edu/people/chaffee/joliet.html
&gt;
&gt; but I joliet well couldn't make em stick to a 2.0.30 kernel tree.
&gt; Has anyone had any more luck with it and if so does it work?

I tried the fat32+joliet patch a while back for 2.0.30. It did work for a
cdrom I have which needed it, fat32 worked as well. I think I used v2.7 of
the patch. Later versions are for the v2.1 kernels so they don't work with
the v2.0. Did you patch it with 'patch -p0'? If a lot of 'junk' files are
left in your current working directory then you probably didn't. Also when
you patch it check the output of patch to see if any of the hunks failed.

I normally use:
zcat foo.patch.gz | patch -p0 2&gt;&1 | less
While in the 'right' directory.

It is necessary to redirect stderr because patch outputs to stderr by
default. There may be an option to change it, but I haven't looked. 

BTW Joilet and FAT32 support should be in v2.2. The patches I mentioned
have been merged into 2.1.60. There were a couple of minor problems with
the merge, but they should have been sorted out with the 2.1.61 kernel
that has just been released. 

Also you shouldn't need joliet support to use mount joliet cdroms. You
just need it for the long filenames.

Mark
