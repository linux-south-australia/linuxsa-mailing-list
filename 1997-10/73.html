     I'll have to agree with Matt here.
     To get the stablity that Redhat and Slackware now have with their 
     distributions take quite a long time and an awful about of human 
     resource. And then to get enough of a following to get good feed back 
     from users about problems/issues.
     
     There are people doing this and doing it well, what we really need it 
     people helping to tackle areas where there are issues that need to be 
     addressed.
     
     If the PnP stuff is bugging you and you have problems with sound why 
     not research this further and put together a web page with hints and 
     tips on how to get this things working well with either Redhat, 
     Slackware or both :-)

&gt; &gt; Is it a PnP card?  Apparrently the upcoming 2.2.x kernels will have PnP 
support.
&gt; &gt; Is the driver detected?  If the driver is detected what does it say? 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes it is a pnp, it is detected, i can now play midi in X, but teh music 
&gt; server for doomII don't work!
That I cannot help you with...
     
Anyone played games under Linux?  Anyone got a tip here?
     
&gt; Kernal 2.2.x is on the way, YEHAR! 
&gt; FAT32 support?
&gt; Where can i get it?
     
I have seen some in-between release stuff on one of the kernel sites, 
but not that much.  Don't know what the full state of play is.
     
&gt; &gt; What are the error messages?  Sometimes you need to compile support for 
&gt; &gt; various things or set up an alias to get it to pick up properly.
&gt; 
&gt; It winges about there not being a version number, & that it can't find 
&gt; some modules, most of these have been fixed with RH4.2
The work around on that was to delete your old modules and recompile 
and then re-install, if it is fixed then it aint an issue.
     
&gt; I am thinking of getting together with some friends & doing a release of 
&gt; Linux for ourselves! Take the best of RH(module support) & the things
&gt; that make slackware good, & include the best programmes to make it good 
&gt; any advice?
Roll your own, good luck.
     
You must have plenty of time and a lot of disk space.
I would suggest helping redhat or slackware and suggesting/offering ideas 
to improve their distributions.
     
Matt
