Partnership with Crack dot Com Brings Games to Linux

RED HAT SOFTWARE AND CRACK DOT COM FORGE RELATIONSHIP TO BRING GAMES
TO LINUX.

Research Triangle Park, NC-- Monday, October 6, 1997 - Red Hat
Software, Inc., publishers of Red Hat Linux, the most stable, fast,
and secure multi-tasking operating system available, and Crack dot
Com, developers of the cult-hit Abuse and the anticipated 3D real-time
strategy game title, Golgotha, today signed an agreement to publish
games for Linux.

Marc Ewing, Vice President and Director of Development at Red Hat
Software said of the relationship, "Red Hat Software is extremely
pleased to be working with such a talented group of artists and
programmers. In addition to being on the leading edge of game
development, Crack dot Com has been a staunch supporter of the Linux
operating system. The combination of Red Hat and Crack will allow
Linux users to have an uncompromised multimedia gaming experience."

The alliance between Red Hat Linux and Crack dot Com will bring
greater speed, better disk efficiency, and stronger net performance.
Crack dot Com envisions a careful marriage of 3D points of view in a
real-time strategy format. Specifically, Golgotha incorporates new
rendering technology, frantic gameplay, and a strong storyline.

"Since I was introduced to Unix variants almost 10 years ago, I've
dreamed of developing and selling games for them.", said Dave Taylor,
of Crack dot Com. "Linux has a development environment far superior to
Windows and Macintosh Operating Systems.  Chances are great that the
typical Linux installation is linked to the Internet and on a higher
bandwidth connection; this offers better net performance. Linux even
has DirectX equivalents, and recently got support for 3DFX's popular
Voodoo chipset. This is a very exciting time for us."

This is an exciting time for the gaming community too. Red Hat
Software and Crack dot Com are the first to sign a publishing
agreement of this kind. Their games will be the first to be marketed,
sold, and supported for Unix and Linux. Clearly both Red Hat Software
and Crack dot Com realize that this is just the beginning for them,
and their alliance promises to bring the latest in technological
advancements to the gaming community.
