&gt; hi again guys,
&gt;     I have a small query regarding the use of a parallel data tranfer
&gt; cable to link my laptop and desktop pc's.  The desktop is running
&gt; slackware with a kernel of 2.0.29 and the laptop is running
&gt; windows 3.1 and dos 6.22.
&gt; from what I understand I could use a dumb terminal program on the laptop
&gt; and login that way, but
&gt; I have no idea where to start.  Presently the only networking I do with
&gt; the Linux box is through
&gt; PPP to my ISP, so if anyone could steer me in the right direction,
&gt; I would be much obliged.

Hi there,

If you are using a parallel data transfer cable (ie. one that plugs
into your printer port as opposed to one that plugs into COM1/COM2)
then you can't use a dumb terminal program.  Dumb terminal programs
only communicate using the COM ports (which use transfer data
serially).

If both machines were running Linux, then you could use the "PLIP"
(Parallel Line Internet Protocol) driver to run a network connection
between them.

Since they're not running Linux, you'll need a "null modem" cable to
connect them (that's different to the regular straight-through cable
that you'd use to connect your computer to your modem).  Once they're
connected you can then use a dumb terminal program on the DOS/Windows
box to log into the Linux machine.  To configure the Linux machine to
allow logins from a serial port add a line such as this to your
/etc/inittab <A HREF="file:">file:</A>
s1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty ttyS0 DT9600 vt100

Then restart init by running:
/sbin/telinit q

(in the above example, replace ttyS0 with ttyS1 if the cable is plugged
into COM2 on the Linux machine instead of COM1)

If you can get the above working, the next fun thing to try is to run
PPP and have a network connection between them.  Of course using
network cards would probably be a lot more sensible if you're doing
this for more than just the "learning experience" :).

Regards,
