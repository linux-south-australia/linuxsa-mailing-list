Joshua Cole &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jcole@arts.adelaide.edu.au">jcole@arts.adelaide.edu.au</A>&gt; said:
&gt; I'm after a little advice.  This morning I started getting messages from
&gt; the filesystem that various inodes were already allocated.  Then the
&gt; trickle turned into a torrent and I could no longer use the thing

You filesystem is seriuosly corrupt.  When the first message happened
you *might* have reduced the impact by restarting and fscking straight
away, but the more you wrote to the filesystem the worse the problem
became.  It's not easy to say how this sort of error occurred; common
reasons include failure to fsck after abnormal system shutdown; disk
error (though this is uncommon); RAM error; and kernel or driver bug.
It's probably worth being confident that the problem isn't related to
your hardware (have you just started using Linux on that machine, or
upgraded it recently?), but other than that it's not important, at this
time, to work out why the problem occurred.

Yes, you could try fsck.  It's surprising how much you can recover.  You
might even find /lib or /bin moved to /lost+found (but renamed as, for
example, /lost+found/#0056733), which would be lucky because that might
be a very quick fix to make ls work again.

Probably it's only your /root partition which has been damaged and your
/home partition (you did say it *is* on a separate partition?) will be
okay.  Re-installing is a quick way of recovering if that's the case.
