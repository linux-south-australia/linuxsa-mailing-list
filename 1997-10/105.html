&gt; This is NOT a good idea.  If "." is at the front of your path and
&gt; someone else has access to your system, they could create a program
&gt; called "ls" in /tmp, which would be executed if you typed:
&gt; cd /tmp
&gt; ls
&gt; 
&gt; Not good.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone really wants to add "." to their PATH, put it at the end,
&gt; not the beginning.  Ie.:
True.

There are some issues about efficiency however.  This includes
some shells will go and search the path for a program.  If you
have a convoluted path (Note: in this case that is unlikely) you
can get definite performance increases through a carefully 
crafted path statement.

But what Geoffrey said is true, and possibly more valid as a reason
to put '.' at the back of the path.  (It has been known to happen).

My vote (is now) in favour of Geoffrey's method (with sorting of
paths for the remaining directories.
