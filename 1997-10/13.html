&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Both the modem and soundcard sections of the phoneblaster work OK.
&gt; &gt; But I get all sorts of strange sounds coming from the the speakers as
&gt; &gt; though something is writing to the modem or soundcard ports (its a
&gt; &gt; voice modem with speakerphone so it can talk out of the soundcard
&gt; 
&gt; This really sounds like (pardon the pun) a problem with EM noise from
&gt; the system. This is unfortunately all to common with equipment from
&gt; Creative/SoundBlaster. They are not exactly known for their DAC and
&gt; on-board amps. (Please, no lawsuits this is mearly a personal obsevation
&gt; after having used/sold/installed hundreds of their products, although I
&gt; will say that it is rare for it to be particularly noticeable.) Make
&gt; sure that the sound card/modem is as far away from any high frequency
&gt; components, eg, video and SCSI cards as possible. Also if you are using
&gt; amplified speakers, make sure they are plugged into the line-out not
&gt; spk-out plug.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems to work fine, ie without the strange sounds, with Solaris x86
&gt; &gt; using the same settings - thats on the same machine.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the bit that has me confused, unless Solaris by default has
&gt; better (lower volume) settings for the mixer that as a result prevent
&gt; you from hearing the digital noise of the system.

I think you are right, the hardware explaination seems to be the only
plausible one. The 2 things that put me off this idea are
  a. The effect is so gross - ie how could anyone sell a device that
     worked so badly!?
  b. It works OK with the Solaris drivers.

I will try isolating and shielding the card tonight and mail the results
as several people have expressed interest.

It may just be that Solaris diables the device when it is not in use. 
Particularly as it turns out that the audio driver is implemented as a 
STREAMS driver, the device may be enabled when the STREAM is opened and
disabled when the STREAM is closed.

Mark Brown.
