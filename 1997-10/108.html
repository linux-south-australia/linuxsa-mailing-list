&gt; &gt; Well I went out and bought my copy last night.  Very favourable coverage,

&gt; I don't want to sound ungrateful, but what have we really got to thank
&gt; them for? After years of failing to acknowledge the existence of Linux,
&gt; they have included a couple of positive articles about Linux. Considering
&gt; that Linux is not only free, but close to the fastest, most versatile,
&gt; most reliable and best supported PC software available, the coverage
&gt; doesn't amount to much.

I know you've been around long enough to have seen how the press has
typically treated linux.  In this case APC have 

a) Done their homework, pretty much got their facts straight.

b) Sought input from the Australian linux community and almost managed to
quote them correctly.

c) Involved the linux community to the point where they printed an article
written by one of us.

d) Committed to providing a regular Linux section in their workshop.

Don't forget that linux is only now (in the past year) becoming suitable
for the mainstream technical user (ie computer literate, but not a
computer-phile).  As such a regular section for linux has only really
become viable for APC in the past year.  We may be the best (ok so I'm a
little biased :), but we're still marginal.

&gt; APC should be congratulated for their coverage of Linux (and it is only
&gt; one swallow so far), but I'll save my thanks for the army that put Linux
&gt; together.
&gt; 
Naturally, however if we are going to complain when the press screws us
around, we must be willing to give them credit when they do right by us.

APC's coverage was good.  It may even be a little biased in our favour.
For this I thank them.
