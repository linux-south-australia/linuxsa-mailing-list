&gt; As a keen but new student of Linux, I have a couple of problems:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.      I can?t execute C programs.  I write a C program, say test.c, then
&gt; compile it with:
&gt; 
&gt;         gcc test.c -o foo
&gt; 
&gt; to produce the executable file ?foo?.  When I type ?foo? to execute the
&gt; program I get:
&gt; 
&gt;         bash : foo : command not found
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody know why it might be doing this?

As someone has pointed out you should have '.' included in your path.
This can be added by creating a file called .profile in your home
directory (see bash(1)) for help.  Add a line 

	PATH=".:$PATH"

to that file.

Just another question however, are you using bash as your default shell or 
just stuffing around as root?

Next problem:
&gt; 
&gt; 2.      My mouse isn?t ?playing the game? in Xwindows.  I plug in and
&gt; configure my mouse to a particular COM port.  This is fine until I quit
&gt; Linux.  When I reboot my machine, go back into Linux, and crank up
&gt; Xwindows, although the pointer appears, the mouse doesn?t work.  If I
&gt; change COM ports and reconfigure the mouse for that new port, all is
&gt; fine until I again quit Linux.  At this point the cycle starts again -
&gt; when I go back into Linux, I need to change over to another COM port
&gt; again for the mouse to work.  Doing this every time I enter Linux
&gt; becomes a tad painful after a while!

Run mouseconfig again.

One trap though under dos, com ports are labelled from 1, under Linux
com ports are labelled from 0.

	com1 == cua0

and so on.

That sounds like the trick which got you.

Matt
