FYI, Picked up from 
	<A HREF="http://my.excite.com/News/971027/15.TECH-INTEL-DEC.html">http://my.excite.com/News/971027/15.TECH-INTEL-DEC.html</A>

Does this mean we will have a Pentium with Alpha Technology?  
Or an Alpha with MMX technology?


	Intel, Digital Joining Forces

             SANTA CLARA, Calif., (Reuters) - Computer chip maker Intel said
today it would
             acquire the semiconductor manufacturing operations of
dataprocessing equipment
             maker Digital Equipment for $700 million, and the two companies
would work
             together on new products. 

             Intel and DEC, which had been feuding over patents, said they would
establish a
             broad-based relationship and would put the litigation between them
on hold until
             federal regulators had approved their plans. 

             Intel will acquire DEC's semiconductor manufacturing operations in
Hudson,
             Mass., and development plants in Austin, Texas, and Jerusalem. 

             DEC will keep its Alpha and Alpha-related semiconductor design
teams to develop
             future Alpha products, with Intel serving as a foundry for DEC's
Alpha mirco
             processors, the companies said. 

             DEC will develop a full line of systems based on Intel's IA- 64
processors,
             starting with a planned Merced" model expected to be released in
1999. In addition,
             DEC will port its industry-leading Digital UNIX to Intel's IA-64
processors. 

             The companies said they would seek a court-ordered stay of the
litigation between
             them.
