Dear LinuxSA members,

Andrae Muys &lt;<A HREF="mailto:A.Muys@mailbox.uq.edu.au">A.Muys@mailbox.uq.edu.au</A>&gt; said:
&gt; [APC] also mentions the various user groups and even mentions AUUG

On this subject, I did mean, at the meeting, last Tuesday, to briefly
talk about AUUG and particularly the Adelaide chapter.  I think this
is relevant to us all because our shared interest--Linux--is a Unix-
like operating system and AUUG's charter is to promote interest in
such things.

Before I step on my virtual soap-box, let me declare that I hold no
relationship with AUUG other than that I am a personal member, and my
company is a corporate sponsor.  My company is a corporate sponsor
because of a belief that what AUUG is doing needs to be done (namely
to support Unix.)  All of what I say is my personal opinion and none
of it represents the official views of AUUG (except, perhaps, the bit
about membership benefits, which is a quote from their web site.)

Each year AUUG holds an annual conference and exhibition--Jeffrey
spoke briefly about this year's exhibition last Tuesday.  To my way of
thinking the conference is even better.  There are always interesting
speakers, both local and international.  I've seen Ken Thompson, the
inventor of Unix, present papers twice.  (One of his papers had absolutely
zero to do with Unix, and it occurred to me that nobody other than Ken
could get away with presenting a non-Unix paper at a Unix conference!)
Dennis Ritchie, the father of C, has presented papers;  likewise
P. J. Plauger (Standard C library.)  This years conference saw both
Eric Allman (Sendmail) and Kirk McKusick (4BSD) present keynotes.
Actually, due to a mixup in communication, which might just have been
a cruel cosmic joke, Eric's talk was billed as, "writing secure programs."
I rate AUUG's conference as a "must see" event every year.

In addition to the conference, AUUG publishes a bi-monthly newsletter,
AUUGN, in which members publish brief papers and share ideas.  Flicking
through one issue picked at random, "Java Goes Orange: The Bounds of
Trust" (concerning security and Java); "Has NT's Time Come?"; "Computer
Magic" (complexity in computing systems); "The Network is Down";
"Confessions of a Road-Trip Tutorial Presenter" (about presenting a
paper at each chapter of AUUG); "Solaris Musings"; and Book reviews
(Linux Secrets; Java Programmer's Library; and Portable Shell Programming.)

There are local chapters of AUUG, funded by a share of the national fees.
AUUG also provides special funding to each chapter to assist them to
present local conferences or tutorials.  Local chapters in the eastern
states are quite active.  At a relatively recent meeting of the Queensland
chapter, a Senior Systems Programmer for Queensland University of
Technology talked about security.  He gave a solid overview of PGP, SSH
and SSL.

The Adelaide chapter, sadly, is non-functional.  As near as I could tell
there were only two AUUG members from Adelaide attending this years
technical conference.  The total membership from Adelaide is small --
smaller than from Tasmania.  And yet the cost of membership is a bargain.
$100 per year, for an individual, even less for students.  I see mutual
benefit in LinuxSA members joining AUUG:  LinuxSA members can greatly benefit
from the wider community of AUUG, and avail themselves of a funding base
to help present events with greater *pow*; and AUUG needs members in
Adelaide.  Remember: We are talking about a non-profit organisation whose
aims are almost identical to ours (ours are a limited subset of AUUGs.)

On AUUG's web site (www.auug.org.au), the following statement explains
membership benefits:

	AUUG membership provides you with:

	* AUUGN - AUUG's regular technical newsletter. See details above.

	* Discounted right to use AARNet for mail - see details below.

	* Discounted access to Email and News services - TMX, Dial-IX
	  and connect.com.au provide electronic mail and news access
	  to all the major networks. They all provide substantial
	  discounts to AUUG members. Contact the AUUG Secretariat for
	  details.

	* Reciprocal Membership Rights with International Affiliates
	  (e.g. Usenix, UniForum) - see details below.

	* Discounts on products and services - AUUG has negotiated
	  discounts at selected book stores and service suppliers
	  (e.g. Prentice Hall, Softway). Details are available from
	  the AUUG Secretariat or the AUUG Members Handbook.

	* Discounted education - AUUG members have access to technical
	  training organisations like Softway at discounted rates.
	  Contact the AUUG Secretariat for details.

	* AUUG Annual Conference and Exhibition - AUUG members get
	  discounted registration fees to Australia's premier Open
	  Systems Conference and the largest Exhibition of UNIX and
	  Open Systems equipment in Australia.  See details below.

	* AUUG Summer Conferences and Tutorials - AUUG members get
	  discounted registration fees to local summer conferences
	  (see below).  Tutorials on a wide range of UNIX and Open
	  systems topics are often held in conjunction with the summer
	  conferences.  AUUG members receive discounted registration
	  fees to these tutorials.

	* Local technical meetings - AUUG local chapters hold regular
	  local meetings with featured speakers and/or panels on a wide
	  range of topics.  These meetings vary from chapter to chapter,
	  so you should contact the local chapter for more details.
