<H1>fun problem with CPU - date - users</H1>

I had a fun problem tonight (this morning).

Earlier today I replaced my Intel P75 with an IBM 6x86 133 (P166).

Booted Win95 and all was well so relaxed.  Much later I booted into
Linux (RH 4.2) and the system reported that I had to change the root
password. In fact all of my phantom users (3) had to change theirs
too. The system date as far as Linux was concered was 1970. I was
fairly sure this was incorrect.  I logged out of the root account and
then tried to log in to find that neither my old or new password
worked.

I rebooted and checked the CMOS date which was correct and then
proceeded to boot into Linux in single user mode. The only quick fix I
could think of was to kill my /etc/passwd file and replace it with
/etc/passwd.OLD (which the system had created).

I rebooted again and my old password got me in again.  I decided to
checkout the other users settings from X with the control-panel
(redhat only I think).  A user I had deleted was back, which wasn't
too much of a surprise with my restoration of the old passwd file.
However a user I hadn't deleted had the '/' directory as their home
directory. I checked this by having this user log on and sure enough
they were dumped politely into '/'.

I have no idea what happened or what I should have done.  I don't
trust my current setup and I'm going for a reinstall to put my mind at
rest.
