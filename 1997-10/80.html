Hi guys,

I'm after a little advice.  This morning I started getting messages from
the filesystem that various inodes were already allocated.  Then the
trickle turned into a torrent and I could no longer use the thing
(commands like 'ls' were not able to be found!).  Upon reboot I get a
kernel panic due to the fact that it can't mount the root filesystem. 

This sounds pretty serious to me.  Is there any point running e2fsck over
that partition?  I don't have the second floppy required for a RedHat 4.2
rescue.  I don't even know if that allows you to e2fsck a partition.

My hope is that the /home partition is not affected, because that contains
important stuff.  I'm comforted by the fact that another MSDOS partition
seems to be ok.  So it's not a complete hard disk failure.

So, questions:

1. Is a RedHat rescue floppy going to help here?
2. What do you guess caused something like this?  (At the time I was
   running gs)
3. What next?  (fdisk to wipe remove the affected partition and remake a
   new one?  RedHat option to update an existing system doesn't recognise
   the affected partition)

Kind regards
Josh
