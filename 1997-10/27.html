&gt;                    Linux for Scientific Computing
&gt;
&gt;  Free Public Presentation as part of the LinuxSA monthly meeting by
&gt;
&gt;                            Andrew Allison
&gt;
&gt;                   Lecturer, University of Adelaide
&gt;
&gt;                 Tuesday 21st October, 1997 at 7:00pm
&gt;
&gt;                    Digital Equipment Corporation
&gt;                     2nd Floor, 139 Frome Street
&gt;                      Adelaide, South Australia
&gt;

&gt;Andrew will be presenting an overview of uses of Linux in Scientific
&gt;Computing.  His presentation will include what is out there on the
&gt;Internet, and he will show how scientific data can be processed in the
&gt;Linux environment with examples in the Economic and Electronic
&gt;domains.  He will use samples of commercially available numerical
&gt;libraries that allow easy implementation of scientific principles.
&gt;Andrew will also present other packages that allow mathematical and
&gt;electronic analysis of data.
&gt;
&gt;Andrew has worked at the CSIRO and Telstra.  His areas of experience
&gt;include numerical analysis, telephony, business data processing,
&gt;computer networks and cable television.  He is married with one
&gt;daughter, and in his spare time he enjoys music performance, computer
&gt;programming, bushwalking and photography.
&gt;
&gt;Over the last seven years Linux has become an important operating
&gt;system within the commercial marketplace.  No longer a hackers system,
&gt;in terms of features, stability, speed and verified volume shipments
&gt;Linux is one of the leading certified UNIX implementations.  Linux is
&gt;one of the few truly open systems on the market today, being able to
&gt;be run on a huge range of hardware, running software written for many
&gt;other operating systems, and integrating into most kinds of networks.
&gt;
&gt;LinuxSA is a Linux Support Group based in South Australia.  LinuxSA's
&gt;primary roles are to act as a local point of contact for Linux to
&gt;people and companies in South Australia, to offer a basic Support
&gt;Infrastructure for people and companies using Linux and finally give
&gt;people and companies an insight into how Linux can be used in the Real
&gt;World.  LinuxSA is associated with no company, charges no fees, and
&gt;generates no revenue.  It is a purely volunteer effort.
