Hi Joshua,


Sounds pretty nasty ...

[snip]

However, you have already made the first step in realising that all is
probably not lost.  A few years ago when I was very green I got so
flumoxed by a similiar problem that I just bailed out and gave up a
lot of work.


&gt; So, questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Is a RedHat rescue floppy going to help here?
&gt; 2. What do you guess caused something like this?  (At the time I was
&gt;    running gs)
&gt; 3. What next?  (fdisk to wipe remove the affected partition and remake a
&gt;    new one?  RedHat option to update an existing system doesn't recognise
&gt;    the affected partition)


I just spent some time on the weekend building YARD rescue disks, ie.

	<A HREF="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~fawcett/yard/">http://www.cs.umass.edu/~fawcett/yard/</A>

If you could build such a disk on a friend's machine you would be able
to mount all uneffected partitions and back up work as a first
precaution.  Also, it would be a good platform to begin experimenting
with the rescue details that others have provided.

I have previously tried to use RedHat installation disks to rescue a
botched installation, and found that they simply do not contain enough
tools to be very useful.  If you are already flustered, not having
your familiar shell and file system tools is pretty stressful.

When using a rescue disk, you are generally operating inside a root
file system on a ram disk.  The critical tools are copied into this
ram disk from a compressed image at boot time.  A friend's rescue disk
will probably contain rescue copies of their own `/etc' files.  In
particular, `/etc/fstab'.

If you know which partitions you were using it is not too difficult to
boot the rescue system and then edit `/etc/fstab'.  Then you can
simply mount your partitions under something like `/OLDROOT' and with
the generous use of `chroot', you are off.


Hope this is of some help rather than just being all the details you
already knew!
