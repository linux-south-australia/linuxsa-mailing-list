&gt; As a keen but new student of Linux, I have a couple of problems:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.	I can’t execute C programs.  I write a C program, say test.c, then
&gt; compile it with:
&gt; 
&gt; 	gcc test.c -o foo
&gt; 	
&gt; to produce the executable file ‘foo’.  When I type ‘foo’ to execute the
&gt; program I get:
&gt; 
&gt; 	bash : foo : command not found
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody know why it might be doing this?
&gt; 
We really should have a AusLUG FAQ, this would be top of the list :).

Answer: When you type a command the shell looks through your execution
path (type `echo $PATH` to see it) to find the executable.  If your
current directory isn't in the path the shell won't find the program and
will report "command not found".  Every directory has a sub-directory "."
which is a pointer to itself.  So to execute a program in the current
directory type `./foobar` (where foobar is the name of the program).  It
is NOT good practice to have "./" in the path there are various reasons
for this but I won't go into it here.

&gt; Next problem:
&gt; 
&gt; 2.	My mouse isn’t ‘playing the game’ in Xwindows.  I plug in and
&gt; configure my mouse to a particular COM port.  This is fine until I quit
&gt; Linux.  When I reboot my machine, go back into Linux, and crank up
&gt; Xwindows, although the pointer appears, the mouse doesn’t work.  If I
&gt; change COM ports and reconfigure the mouse for that new port, all is
&gt; fine until I again quit Linux.  At this point the cycle starts again -
&gt; when I go back into Linux, I need to change over to another COM port
&gt; again for the mouse to work.  Doing this every time I enter Linux
&gt; becomes a tad painful after a while!  
&gt; 
Looks like you need to edit your setup files.  What do you type to change
COM ports?
