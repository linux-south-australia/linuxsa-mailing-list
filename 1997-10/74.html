&gt; SO.. any good pipe references out there? (A good 'Nutshell' book?)

[[ David's tutorial follows.  If you already know Unix it will probably
bore you. ]]

Actually, real Unix on-line manual pages are very good, but I note that
Linux's manual pages are somewhat missing in the information I was going
to refer you to.  I was going to refer you to the intro manual pages in
sections 1 and 2, as well as the sh manual page because, between them,
they explain how Unix 'works' rather elegantly; particularly with reference
to the concept of processes and pipelines.  Such a pity that this central
Unix concept is not covered as well as it deserves to be.  There's probably
an opportunity to give back to the community here...  

Pipes are easy.  The Unix shells provide mechanisms which you can use them
to allow you to generate remarkably sophisticated 'programs' out of simple
components.  We call that a pipeline.  A pipeline is composed of a data
generator, a series of filters, and a data consumer.  Often that final is
as simple as displaying the final output on stdout, and sometimes the first
stage is as simple as reading from stdin.  I think all shells use the "|"
character to separate each stage of a pipeline.  So:

    data-generator | filter | ... | filter | data-consumer

Each stage of the pipeline runs in parallel, within the limits which the
system permits.  Hey, look closely, because that last phrase is important.
Are you on a uni-processor system because if you are, then obviously only
one process runs at a time, although that point is simply nitpicking.  But
pipes are buffers capable of holding only finite data.  A process can write
into a pipe until that pipe is full.  When the pipe is full the process
writing into it blocks until some of the data already in the pipe has been
read.  Similarly, a process can read from a pipe until that pipe is empty.
When it's empty the reading process is blocked until some more data has
been written into the pipe.

An interesting effect of pipes, which is not immediately obvious, is that
'record boundaries' can be lost in a pipe.  What I mean: If a program reads
from the terminal using buffered stream libraries, it will be given data
one line at a time.  Likewise if it writes to the terminal using buffered
stream libraries the data will be displayed one line at a time.  But if a
program writes into a pipe that data will be sent to the pipe one stream
buffer at a time; that's about 1K of data.  So if your data generator
'emits' a line of data (using the buffered stream library) to a pipe, the
data might actually NOT be written immediately, but maybe held in an
internal buffer (internal the data generator) until there's enough data
to make it worth sending.

Similarly, the program reading from a pipe might get a partial line from
the read.  That can cause unintentional effects.  Suppose, for example,
that the end of your pipeline is reading a list of files and directories
to delete, and supposing the buffer is five characters long.  If you
write "/user/john" into the pipe, what comes out could be "/user"  and
"/john".  Curious, yes?

This buffering effect of the stream libraries might sound like a bad
thing but it actually gives you performance benefits most of the time.
If you are writing a program which uses them you should consider how
buffering will affect your program in a pipeline, but other than that
I wouldn't be upset about it.  As I said: It's a good thing.

If you are constructing a pipeline (as all true Unix users do every day)
you should remember the buffering effect which the stream libraries and
which pipes both introduce.  If your pipeline starts with something which
reads lines from standard input and then writes variations of those lines
to standard output, remember that the second stage of the pipeline might
not receive any input until you have typed a few lines; and then it might
receive all of those lines in one go!  Here's an example of what I mean
for you to try:

   awk '{$2="SURPRISE"; for (i=0; i&lt;100; i++) print }' | grep -n SURPRISE

None of this directly answered the original question which really was
about putting ftp commands into a file.  I think one thing which is worth
noting (and I believe you have to really read the ftp manual page closely
to find this out) is that if ftp reads it's input from a terminal (or maybe
if it writes to a terminal, or maybe either or both; it seems to change
from Unix to Unix), it tries to "auto-login", which is, it checks your
.netrc file or it prompts for a user and password.  If you're not on a
terminal (that is, input or maybe output or maybe either or both is a
pipe, or regular file, or socket), or if you specify "-n" when you start
ftp, then you have to use the "user" and "pass" commands in your ftp
command stream.

Eg: echo -e "user foobie\npass bletch\nput my-file" | ftp -n theirhost

Hope this helps.  And please, don't thank me, just buy Internet access
from me!  :-) :-)  (<A HREF="http://www.rebel.net.au/rebelnet/">http://www.rebel.net.au/rebelnet/</A>)
