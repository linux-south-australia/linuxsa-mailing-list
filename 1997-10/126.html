&gt; I want to set up IP masquerading on my network, but due to the other

&gt; 
&gt; can anybody suggest a way of either having dial-on-demand, or running a 
&gt; script on the linux box from an icon/batch file without having to know a 
&gt; single thing about unix ?

Get the modutils source. Inside with the kerneld stuff should be a
'request-route' script. Put this in /sbin and edit it however you like.
Whenever the kernel comes across an address it find a route for it will
get kerneld to run the /sbin/request-route script with the 1st parameter
the ip address that it wants to route packets too. The job of
/sbin/reqest-route is to provide set up a route which leads to the
specified host. Normally you can ignore the parameter since you only have
1 way of providing a route.

I don't use this method anymore since I don't have a dedicated phone line
for my modem, and because it normally takes 10-15 tries to get into my
lame ISP. Instead I wrote little bash 'auto-dial'. Its a bit of a hack,
but it seems to be working well. I can mail it to you if you like. 

If you want to make it easy to use and don't care too much about security
in your local net then you could use the auto-dial script as a login shell
for a user 'dial' or something. Then ppl could telnet in as dial to bring
up the connection.

You could also put auto-dial into the /sbin/request-route script.

Mark
