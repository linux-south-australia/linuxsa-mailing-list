                    Linux for Scientific Computing

  Free Public Presentation as part of the LinuxSA monthly meeting by

                            Andrew Allison

                   Lecturer, University of Adelaide

                 Tuesday 21st October, 1997 at 7:00pm

                    Digital Equipment Corporation
                     2nd Floor, 139 Frome Street
                      Adelaide, South Australia

Andrew will be presenting an overview of uses of Linux in Scientific 
Computing.  His presentation will include what is out there on the 
Internet, and he will show how scientific data can be processed in the
Linux environment with examples in the Economic and Electronic 
domains.  He will use samples of commercially available numerical 
libraries that allow easy implementation of scientific principles.  
Andrew will also present other packages that allow mathematical and 
electronic analysis of data.

Andrew has worked at the CSIRO and Telstra.  His areas of experience 
include numerical analysis, telephony, business data processing, 
computer networks and cable television.  He is married with one 
daughter, and in his spare time he enjoys music performance, computer 
programming, bushwalking and photography.

Over the last seven years Linux has become an important operating 
system within the commercial marketplace.  No longer a hackers system,
in terms of features, stability, speed and verified volume shipments 
Linux is one of the leading certified UNIX implementations.  Linux is 
one of the few truly open systems on the market today, being able to 
be run on a huge range of hardware, running software written for many 
other operating systems, and integrating into most kinds of networks.

LinuxSA is a Linux Support Group based in South Australia.  LinuxSA's 
primary roles are to act as a local point of contact for Linux to 
people and companies in South Australia, to offer a basic Support 
Infrastructure for people and companies using Linux and finally give 
people and companies an insight into how Linux can be used in the Real
World.  LinuxSA is associated with no company, charges no fees, and 
generates no revenue.  It is a purely volunteer effort.
