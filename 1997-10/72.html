&gt; &gt; Is it a PnP card?  Apparrently the upcoming 2.2.x kernels will have PnP support.
&gt; &gt; Is the driver detected?  If the driver is detected what does it say?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes it is a pnp, it is detected, i can now play midi in X, but teh music
&gt; server for doomII don't work!
That I cannot help you with...

Anyone played games under Linux?  Anyone got a tip here?

&gt; Kernal 2.2.x is on the way, YEHAR!
&gt; FAT32 support?
&gt; Where can i get it?

I have seen some in-between release stuff on one of the kernel sites,
but not that much.  Don't know what the full state of play is.

&gt; &gt; What are the error messages?  Sometimes you need to compile support for
&gt; &gt; various things or set up an alias to get it to pick up properly.
&gt; 
&gt; It winges about there not being a version number, & that it can't find
&gt; some modules, most of these have been fixed with RH4.2
The work around on that was to delete your old modules and recompile
and then re-install, if it is fixed then it aint an issue.

&gt; I am thinking of getting together with some friends & doing a release of
&gt; Linux for ourselves! Take the best of RH(module support) & the things
&gt; that make slackware good, & include the best programmes to make it good
&gt; any advice?
Roll your own, good luck.

You must have plenty of time and a lot of disk space.
I would suggest helping redhat or slackware and suggesting/offering ideas
to improve their distributions.
