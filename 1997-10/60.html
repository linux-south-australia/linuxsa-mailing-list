  BH&gt; Does anyone know of a good tutorial for Emacs. I have the manual
  BH&gt; but I was after something that would help a vi user move to
  BH&gt; Emacs.  In as much as, these are the vi commands, these are the
  BH&gt; equivalent Emacs commands.

I would recommend _against_ this approach.  Emacs is much bigger and
feature-rich than vi, but to benefit from using emacs, you need to
know how to use it _properly_.

i.e. the often used philosophy of "dive in an try it out; read the
instructions only in emergency" is not suitable.

The best way is to give yourself time to RTFM.  Type `C-h t' to run
the tutorial.  Learn how `info' works.  Learn about apropos-help, so
that next time you have a query, you'll be able to answer it yourself.

BTW, there are some good emacs intro pages in the GNUS info pages (see
"Emacs for Heathens"), and in the Viper info pages (see "Emacs
Preliminaries"). (Viper is a Vi emulation package, much like VIP, but
as I said above, it is better to forget about `vi' altogether and
learn emacs properly, rather than trying some half-baked approach).
