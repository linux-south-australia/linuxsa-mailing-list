The Creative Phoneblaster is a combination sound card/voice modem. I asked
this question on a couple of newsgroups a few weeks ago but didn't find any 
solutions. I also didn't hear from anyone saying that they had one working,
there must be someone out there using this card??

(Using slackware 2.0.0)
Both the modem and soundcard sections of the phoneblaster work OK.
But I get all sorts of strange sounds coming from the the speakers as though something 
is writing to the modem or soundcard ports ( its a voice modem with speakerphone so it 
can talk out of the soundcard directly) I guess not the modem port though, as arbitary 
writes would most likely trash it, but it works fine. It makes assorted clicks and 
gurgles for any screen draw, key press (even without drawing a char to the screen), 
hard disk or cdrom access. They don't come out at a very high volume so it is not very 
noticable for example when playing an audio CD but it is loud enough to be very
annoying for regular use - scrolling files, moving the mouse etc.
 
The modem is set to irq 11 with the default address for serial port 3 in rc.serial and 
the soundcard driver is the default sound module from rc.modules which should be OK 
(irq 5 addr 220). Also the actual settings for the various devices look fine with 
setserial and the various pseudo files in /proc.

It seems to work fine, ie without the strange sounds, with Solaris x86 using the same
settings - thats on the same machine.

Suggestions? Theories?

Mark Brown.
