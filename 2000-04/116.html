Hans,
I recently completely messed up my hard drive.
I lost loads of totally irreplaceable data - or so I thought...
I tried everything I know, but no luck until...
Someone suggested two products - one was Tiramisu and the other was Lost and
Found.
I tried Tiramisu for a Fat32 partition and magically retrieved all my
critical data.
I also obtained, but have not yet tried Lost and Found. But I believe it can
retrieve Linux partition data. I believe there is aversion of Tiramisu which
will recover Linux stuff, but I'm not sure.
In my case, with Tiramisu, I was able to retrieve the data, but the
directory structure was still a little bit messed up.
I think the less damage caused, the better the result - and I had 'played'
with the drive in my attempts to recover the data before I tried Tiramisu,
so I think I caused more damage in the process.
One thing that caused me problems was that I needed an additional hard drive
to save the recovered data to. I had to rip apart my daughters PC, steal the
hard drive, save all her file to a safe place on the drive, then recover my
files to that drive - My daughter was not happy with me and looked on with
much concern.
If you can't find Tiramisu, please e-mail me directly and I'll let you know
how I got my copy...
