Eric:

&gt; Does Java do the same thing?

Neither Java nor Perl do that at all. CGI scripts can actually be
written in any language at all...I'd hazard a guess one could write a
CGI script even in BASIC. I think you are describing three separate
things here:

1) CGI - Common Gateway Interface
2) JavaScript or JScript (both TradeMarks) on the web browser
3) Java Serlets

David's Vague Description of CGI
--------------------------------

Common Gateway Interface is a method whereby a web-server (such as
Apache) can execute an application on the server. Mostly the application
is run by a separate process from the actual web-server itself. In the
case of a PERL script, the PERL interpreter runs the application.

Without getting into the gory details, through a combination of
environment variables passed to the CGI script and STDIN (see LinuxSA's
tips pages)..your script can find out a host of information about how it
was called and what URL called it.

It uses this information to print out a MIME-FORMAT message to the
web-server via STDOUT. Whilst a significant amount of CGI scripts send a
"content-type: text/plain" or "content-type: text/html" there's no
reason you can't send a MIME encoded audio file, image or other
multimedia extension in reply. The web-server simply passes on the
result of the CGI script to the web-browser. The result is read from
STDOUT.

Hence, provided your programming language can read and write to
STDIN/STDOUT it can be used for a CGI script. PERL seems to be the most
common scripting language. When deciding on a language for a CGI script
you should choose a language that makes sense to your needs...factors
considered should be speed, amount of support, ease of use...PERL is
relatively fast, has a huge amount of support and once you've gotten
over REGULAR expressions quite easy to use.

Incidentally, what joker called REGULAR expressions REGULAR? I'd hardly
call "s/^*.(abc]?/Hi there $1/g" a REGULAR expression...apart from the
fact that I've probably stuffed the syntax up, it is vaguely in a
REGULAR expression format....


JAVA SCRIPT/JSCRIPT (and other scripting languages) ON THE BROWSER
------------------------------------------------------------------

Many modern browsers support some version of Java Script in their HTML
pages. They may also support other scripting languages such as VBScript.
You should be aware that Java Script is NOT THE SAME as Java Applets
(Java Script only looks like Java...it is NOT Java). These languages,
unlike in CGI, are interpreted by the browser (not the web server) on
the client's side.

So, what does Java Script do?

Firstly, Java Script was developed by Netscape. Microsoft calls its
version of Java Script JScript. I use the term Java Script for both of
them. If you understand GUI and event-driven programming AND Object
Oriented Programming models understanding how JavaScript works is easy.
If you don't, just bear with me...

Netscape decided to divide your browser into various "objects". Objects
(in English names) such as "the history list", "the document", "the set
of links". All of these objects can have events happen to them. For
example, when the history list is changed it has a "changed event"
occur. When the document is opened it has an "on Load" event occur.

You can attach JavaScript functions or snippets to these events. An
example is:

&lt;!--
&lt;a href="<A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com.au">http://www.netcraft.com.au</A>"
onMouseOver="a_java_script_function()"&gt;Netcraft's Home Page&lt;/a&gt;
--&gt;

When the mouse passes over the hyperlink, the function is called...you
define the function on the page or  in a function repository. If the
browser understands the tags it will execute the function. Because HTML
is extraordinarily lenient, if the browser does not understand the tags
it just ignores them and your fancy tricks won't work.

So, to recap, Java Script (and other scripting languages) are used to
execute little scripts on the client or web-browser. 

JAVA SERVLETS
-------------

Java Servlets are applications that run on a web-server. The web-server
is called the Java WebServer. The Apache Software Foundation also
develop Apache JServ. These are written in Java and serve a similar
function to CGI. JavaSoft claims that servlets are better because:

* they're faster

Not from what I've seen.

* they're more stable

Well, the code itself is. Unfortunately I've only seen Servlets running
on NT 4.0 with a Pervasive SQL Engine running and it or they both
crashed each other about two times a day.

* they implement some really cool features

Such as object persistence, better authentication, encryption....

I understand that Apache JServ is realtively stable and works well.


-----------

Now that I've explained all that I hope that answers or at leasts helps
you think about the qustions you asked.

&gt; Is Java replacing Perl?

Is C++ replacing C? Taking your answer in a general sense (i.e. Are all
or a majority of PERL programs being rewritten into Java), I don't think
so.

&gt; Is there functionality in Perl that Java doesn't have, or vice versa?

They are two different programming languages. Of course there are....
