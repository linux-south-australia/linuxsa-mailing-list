&gt; I've got a problem on a mail server whereby users seem to be checking
&gt; their e-mail twice at the same time.  The users assure me that they
&gt; certainly aren't checking their e-mail twice and in fact, a check of one
&gt; of the boxes that seems to have this problem (a Windoze machine using
&gt; Outlook 2000 to retrieve mail) doesn't even have auto-checking of e-mail.

I've seen Outlook Express 97 do this with multiple accounts defined
(it looks like it's logging onto the POP server sequentially, but
there was definite overlap in there), and one other Outlook something
or other doing the same with a single account.  The solution to the
former was relatively easy (don't do that; disable the redundant
account), and the solution to the latter was to shift them to Netscape
Communicator, which didn't do that (it also handled MIME attachments
that Outlook couldn't).
