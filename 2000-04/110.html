&gt; If I have a TCP connection saying "CLOSE_WAIT" as its state the manual

&gt; because Netscape helpfully died on me.

I think the manual needs a better explanation.

&gt; I know the local IP address, where the socket belongs and which port
&gt; number it is on. This is to say I have sufficient information to specify
&gt; exactly which socket I want to operate on. Is there any tool/command to
&gt; forcibly close a TCP/IP socket???

You're in luck.  "shutdown -r now" (when run as root) clears all sockets
in the CLOSE_WAIT state, with few unexpected side-effects.

Seriously, you should only be concerned if they don't timeout and
eventually disappear (where "eventually" really means "one of the
TCP timers expires, but I can't remember which one").  (Rummages
for TCP state diagram, can't find it, utters profanity)  Forget
it.  Without the pretty pictures to back me up and prod my aging
memory, I will neither confirm or deny what I was about to say.
If this really troubles you, Douglas Comer and W. Richard Stevens
are your friends.
