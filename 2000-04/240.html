&gt;Which they won't follow, won't be able to read the simple instructions,
&gt;will power off anyway, or the cleaner plugs the Vacume cleaner into the
&gt;UPS and overloads it.

hmmm .... :-)))

&gt;Which again they will be incabable of following the simple instrucctions
&gt;of how to change. Sorry to be so negative, but it is bitter personal
&gt;experience, and reems of tech support anecdotes. Visit www.rinkworks.com
&gt;for extensive examples.

I have found that in most companies there is one staff memeber who is willing
to switch tapes once a day :-))

&gt;I actually think this is a good idea from the technical standpoint, and if

&gt;such a system existed, it'd help sysadmins accross the world, particularly

&gt;in large organisations. The business side of things in your proposal will
&gt;be the uphill work, as I stated before, remote admin is a good idea, but
&gt;companies like to see a person with a floppy disk.

In this sort of situation a server of some sort must exist which updates the
server/desktops etc. Who says this server can't be onsite, allowing for a contracter/sysadmin
to make changes to a database on a local server, which then updates the rest
of the systems in the network. Obviously this completely destroys the concept
of remote system administration, and many would say, if you were to go in to
update the server ... why bother having a second computer to update the server;
but in the case where there are a number of systems to be updated, being able
to update a single database on one system both gives the software a good use,
plus "company sees person with disk doing stuff" :-)))

&gt;If you did develop such a distribution system, either GPLed or for a price

&gt;I'd be on the queue to get it. You'd probably make more money selling the
&gt;product than the service.

agreed ... this package would definantly be of interest to me !
