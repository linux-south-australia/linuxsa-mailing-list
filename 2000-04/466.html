&gt; These StepBySteps which you have been collecting are rather good.
&gt; An excellent resource, indeed.

Thank you., they were originally concieved as an answer on some large
mailgroups to replying again and again to the same 'my soundcard doesn't work'.

rather than the responder , thru boredom, introducing typos and innacuracies in
the 83rd reply, i set up the site so that typical questions can be answered
'see sound-&gt;awe64 on the site below'.

(now all the typos and innacuracies have been condensed into one site &lt;grin&gt;)

it has since grown to seven mirrors, 3 maintainers and many contributors.
Material on the Steps is generally fresher than a howto. The top layer, if you
like, will give you the quick 'n dirty steps to get the animal working, but
quite a few contributors add an addenda which goes into gory detail. This
is the reverse of the traditional howto. Get it working first, then you'll
understand the theory.

any person can contribute (write on) any subject, the only proviso is they must
have personally installed the thing. I don't accept 3rd person narrative.

technical authors are using site material for their next books.
The copyright for them is the same as for everyone, keep the email
address of the author prominent, and you can do whatever you wish with the
content.
