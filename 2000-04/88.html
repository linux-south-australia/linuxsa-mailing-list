If I decide to build a web server, and 

&gt;
&gt;I don't hink you need to register a domain name server.
&gt;You do need to register a domain for which it usually necessary to ahve a 

&gt;configured primary and secondary nameserver.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From memory typicially you set up a primary  DNS server and secondary as
&gt;if you had the domain, then contact the appropriate registery fromt eh
&gt;domain you want to register.
&gt;
&gt;Typically they have an online form which will allow you to submit your
&gt;details, including those of your now configured primary and secondary DNS
&gt;servers, which the registery normally checks automatically when you submit

&gt;your application or as part of the submission process.
&gt;
&gt;Then if you are nto or cna not pay by credit card you send of your
&gt;payment.
&gt;
&gt;Then you wait a day or two (or months if you want .org.au) and with luck
&gt;you get your domain.
&gt;
&gt;I think the registers for .au are  
&gt;.com.au -www.melbourneit.com.au
&gt;.asn.au  connect west which can be reached via www.west.net.au
&gt;.net.au Connect.com - registry.connect.com.au
&gt;.org.au <A HREF="http://www.aunic.net/org-au.html">http://www.aunic.net/org-au.html</A>
&gt;
&gt;I think melbourneit can help you with ointernational registrations as wel
&gt;eg .com .net .org .tu balh blah blah.
&gt;
&gt;You will also need a NIC handle which you can apply for here:
&gt;<A HREF="http://www.aunic.net/">http://www.aunic.net/</A>
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The exact process varies from registry to registry, but I think this is
&gt;valid for all of them apart possibly from .org.au(having never
&gt;successfuly registered a .org.au domain  I don't really know. In fact
&gt;havnign never even recieved a reply or even a rejection notice formt he
&gt;registrar - I may have had a bad experience, btu I have on behlaf of two
&gt;organisations applied for .org.au domains and never heard back. I suggest
&gt;.asn if at all possible - typical turn around less than 24 hours often
&gt;a couple of hours).
&gt;
&gt;Typically you will require some proof that you are eligible for a domain.
&gt;Eg for .com.au this is usually a business number or an ACN and the domain
&gt;must amongst other things derive from the letters contianed in your
&gt;businesses name. FOr .asn it might be a certificate of associationor
&gt;articles of incorporation or some such.
&gt;
&gt;The poliices are different form registry to registry so you need ot do a
&gt;bit of reading.
&gt;
&gt;It has been at least 12 months since I last registered any domain. but I
&gt;think this is a reasonably accurate descriptionof the process, and if not,

&gt;I am fairly sure the URLS at least are accurate, frm where you should be
&gt;able to get all the info you need.
&gt;
