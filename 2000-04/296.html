Hi Steve,

try compiling it with 3 threads (1 more threads than proccesors), from
some where I think I might have read (read: cant remember, may not be
true :-) that makes sure that the system is always busy.

I have a bp6 with 2x366 it compiles in under 3 minutes (under 180 secs),
while running KDE desktop, 128MB Ram, three threads.


ben....  :-)

&gt; Today I finnaly got a couple of Celeron 466 CPU's to try on an Abit BP6
&gt; motherboard.  Due to circumstances I did not have any of my normal RedHat
&gt; CD's at home so I thought I would try the Corel Linux CD.
&gt; 
&gt; I was supprised to find that it detected the SMP and installed an
&gt; appropriate Kernel.  Eager to see what it could do I tried to think what I
&gt; could use to do some sort of benchmark.  Well the only thing I could come
&gt; up with quickly was to compile the kernel so I created a script to
&gt; make clean
&gt; make dep
&gt; make bzImage
&gt; with a test for elapsed time.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, the first 3 runs were all around 220 seconds so I thought lets try
&gt; the -j2 switch to use both processors
&gt; 
&gt; make -j2 clean
&gt; make -j2 dep
&gt; make -j2 bzImage
&gt; 
&gt; After 3 runs they all turned exactly 139 seconds.
&gt; 
&gt; I love it!  It beats the 1/2 hour of the old AMD K5 100
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, slight cheat, the 466's are running at 525MHz  (75MHz bus speed)
&gt; 
&gt; Still, 220 down to 139 looks good to me.
&gt;
