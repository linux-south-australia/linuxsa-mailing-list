HI,

The only thing I can find out at this stage is that it will cost about $2000
+ to set up.
The service varies 1MB upwards, MB charges and a flat service fee / year.

The service varies from location to location and service provider.
Primus have a service coming up in Adelaide soon which allow 1 - about 10MB.
I contacted Primus in Sydney and they were very vague about it.. Not what I
expected from them. They were almost rood trying to get rid of me as they
had not been briefed on the services going in in Adelaide.

Primus: 8mb link outbound and 2 mb incoming , and costs around $75 per month
after the set-up.

Also Optus is looking at providing the service. But I haven't been able to
get much from them either.
Austar was doing some things in this area a few months ago, but all has gone
quiet on this one..

AirNet is another one, but after sending numerous Emails to them they never
got back to me..

My problem is that I live at Bridgewater and as a result have HUGE problems
getting anything over 14k4 from my house..
I am a long way from the local exchange..
So ADSL would have been a saviour, but as Optus and Primus have said to me
they don't think they will consider anything in the Adelaide hills for some
time..

I would have thought the local government would be promoting people working
at home and thus helping companies implementing this sort of technology in
the Adelaide area.. mumble.. mumble..
I thought we were to be the smart state!!!



Derek

Subject: ADSL. who? when? where? how much?


Hey All,

Wondering if anyone has bookmarked any links about ADSL? As it relates to
Australia, more specifically? Or if anyone here might know the answers:

Which of the following would be a better option?

Linking two offices with an ADSL link?  (Is that possible?? And how much
would it cost if it is?) or giving both offices an ADSL Internet link and
setting up an encrypted VPN between them?

Pros and Cons of each?

Cheers

Darryl
