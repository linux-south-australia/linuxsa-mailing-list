&gt; Something ACAP and LDAP (and I'm sure there are others) are designed
&gt; to address.

Between them, ACAP, LDAP, IMAP make for a very good solution. See
<A HREF="http://www.cyrusoft.com">http://www.cyrusoft.com</A> for an example of a client that does these
protocols very well. Eudora does them too, but not as neatly.

However it looks like ACAP is on the very edge of not gaining critical 
mass. Why? Because it is "just another database for storing options" and
people can't be bothered seeing why it fills a very special niche. So much
as I hate to say it don't bank on ACAP necessarily being the worldbeater
it should be.

&gt; &gt; It also provides a way for ppl to view mail from outside the domain in a
&gt; &gt; relatively secure manner if you have POP blocked for addresses outside the
&gt; &gt; domains being served.
&gt; 
&gt; So you've opened with HTTP what you've secured by denying POP3 access?
&gt; If it's an issue of password snarfing, then you've had not much of a
&gt; win here at all.

I'm not a webmail bigot but I do think that this point has validity. If a
sysadmin has a choice of letting more or fewer protocols he should go for
fewer. Webmail allows this elegantly.
