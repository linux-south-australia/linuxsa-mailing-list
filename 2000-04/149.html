If you can afford the course, you can afford the airfare.
In my experience, it's better to take this style of course
away from your usual environment as it is important to have a
low level of workaday interruption and to have the evenings
free.

I have more difficulty with the description of the course as
being for system administrators (as opposed to RH resellers).

For example, it doesn't cover LDAP or logical volume managers,
or database tuning.  In short, if RH Linux doesn't have it
today, it isn't taught.

A more generic Linux course, with an eye to features that might
be ported from other UNIX platforms, would be more profitable
for the major training course for a system administrator that
you might send a sysadm on as part of their early training.

For sysadm training, you also want to dump some of the stuff
that a sysadm could discover from the manual pages for an
overview of TCP/IP, installing software from source, and a
session on good practices.

&gt; ...standard TCP/IP protocols such as BIND, Samba, and NFS

BIND isn't a standard, it's a program suite implementing the
DNS standard protocol.  Samba isn't a standard, it's a program
suite implementing the non-standard SMB protocol.

&gt; Linux is the fastest growing operating environment.

Faster than Nokia phones or PalmPilots?   Hmmm.
