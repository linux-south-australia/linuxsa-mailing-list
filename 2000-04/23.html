 &gt; Heyas
 &gt; I am trying to run LyX on a system, and failing.
 &gt; lyx: error in loading shared libraries: lyx: undefined symbol: fl_gc

G'day Toby,
I've got Lyx on my Redhat 6.0 and from memory (it was 3 months  ago)
, I had to install the xform binaries from their ftp site.


 &gt; So, it appears that I don't have a reqquired library, either to support
 &gt; lyx or latex/tex.
 &gt; I can run xforms test applications, so it appears to be okay.
 &gt; I can run tex and latex, so they too seem okay.
 &gt;
 &gt; I made the mistake of getting a binary distrib of lyx, so I don't think I
 &gt; can check the code myself to find what it expects fl_gc to be..
 &gt;
 &gt; (Or can I? ldd output is as follows:
 &gt; 	libforms.so.0.88 =&gt; /usr/lib/libforms.so.0.88 (0x40019000)
 &gt; 	libXpm.so.4 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4 (0x400fb000)

I did a quick search thru the source and fl_gc nad it belongs to the 
file called screen.C, which from my *very* limited knowledge of C, seems 
to render the document itself. All the references in the function around 
it refer to xforms.

You appear to have the right version of xforms so I'm buggered if I 
know!! All I can tell you is that mine wouldn't compile without the 
aforementioned binaries.


 &gt; Before I download the src and waste more time, does anyone recognize that
 &gt; function, and know what it is supposed to be in?
 &gt;
 &gt; Thanks
 &gt;
 &gt; Toby


Cheers,

Craig
