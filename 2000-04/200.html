&gt; Neither Java nor Perl do that at all. CGI scripts can actually be
&gt; written in any language at all...I'd hazard a guess one could write a
&gt; CGI script even in BASIC. I think you are describing three separate
&gt; things here:

If you want to do dynamic content based on Java it is more common to use
servlets that Java CGI, though you could do this.

It is of course psosiible that the auto filling in is done on a second or
third or more form, ie it is a form genrated with some forms partilly
complete from info already supplied by the user, or form soemother source,
in which ase Java(as servletes or CGI) or perl coudl do it.

Though it does seem likely tht there would be some Javascript if the
wholeform was not javascript generated.

Of coure even if the form was javascript generated there is nothing to say
that the javascript was not generated by a servlet or cgi scriipt.

There is also the possibilty that the form was actualya Java applet, or
even a perl applet(I bbeleive there is a perl to java bytecode
crosscompiler so you cna write applets in perl now).

Perhaps Eric could supply an URL and then people oculd give him a better
answer.

As for is one language replacing the other, well as with all holy wars it
depends who you talk to.

I think in the long run at leaast on larger sites Java will probably
become very prevalent because it is beingused by many enterprise
throughout the enterprise, so it probably amkes snese to do your web
developemnt inthe same language, using the smae calsses/objects, smae
metaphor and same programmers.

         Some people have a way about them that seems to say: "If I have
