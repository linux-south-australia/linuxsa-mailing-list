Hi group,

I am hoping that someone can help me to help a PC-not-very-literate
friend, who is having trouble with an old IBM PC. The only linux link in
this is that I am trying to convince this friend to make a start with
Linux, and this problem is a major stumbling block to him being able to
do that. The problem is hardware/BIOS related. Maybe someone on this
group can point me to a resource that might be able to help.

The problem is that this friend, who lives in Mudgee NSW and does not
have a lot of money to splash around, has tried to upgrade an old-ish
IBM pc, and has run into a snag with his new hard drive. The PC is an
IBM PSV 2410-0H9. He has added more ram (now 32M) and a 6.??Gb hard
drive. The hard drive is only recognised as 500 Mb, and it seems that
this may be a BIOS limitation on that machine. Does this ring any bells
with anyone? I am hoping that when this problem is overcome I can
convince him to put aside a healthy swag of space from the new drive,
and help him put Linux on it. It is fun helping from such a distance,
but frusttrating that I can't actually get my fingers onto the keyboard
at times!!

The other possibility is for me to send him my old motherboard, which I
had an old 486 33 running on, my very first Linux box (sniff). I just
have to see if it will take his AMD 586-133 chip. Hmm, where did I file
that booklet...

Thanks if anyone can shed any light. Sorry if it isn't quite on-topic. I
hope I can coax him onto this mailing list once he has Linux installed.

Bruce
