There was quite a long discussion on this at the Sydney conference in
March. It is true you can construct many instances where virus behaviour
would work for Linux.

There seem to be two main reasons advanced for why we don't have an
epidemic of viruses right now. One of them isn't that there is lack of
cracker interest. I'm not going to back my personal opinion up on this at
all, but I believe that there is a lot of cracker interest in this. (Do
the research for yourself and come to your own subjective assessment, just
like I did. The topic interests a bit.)

The first reason seems to be that Linux propagation mechanisms aren't
currently as favourable as they are under DOS/Windows. Under Windows,
accepting raw executables via email is very much doable and done, and
nearly all Windows users are vulnerable to MS Office Macro Viruses because
they nearly all run MS Office (with the equivalent of root privilege,
where that matters.) Who knows whether this will change. On the one hand
there are 50+ distributions of Linux all with their own security control
and change management procedures (ie notionally less likely to find a
security flaw open in all of them) while on the other there are a few key
applications that are very widely deployed in similar configurations (eg
Apache's marketshare has increased each month recently, see
<A HREF="http://www.netcraft.co.uk/survey.">http://www.netcraft.co.uk/survey.</A>)

The second, hotly-debated reason is that the model we have in open source
for developing applications and distributions is both a deterrent and a
means for quickly fixing viruses... and building Linux (or distributions)
so they are unlikely to occur again. One thing that cannot be debated is
that if there is a weakness in the Linux kernel then the kernel team's
approach is to address weaknesses even at the expense of backwards
compatibility. The opposite has been true with Windows.

Whatever the real reasons, it is true that tampered-with code such as
viruses don't appear to be a problem at all under Linux now.
