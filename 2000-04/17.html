Kirsty... have seen the same error - caused by an outlook user logging
into a Linux Mail Server...
The system it happens on is using exim.  The user is attempting to
access 3 diffferent mail accounts & intermittently gets the "...locking
INBOX..." error when they try to get into the 2nd & 3rd accounts.

The problem I have seen **appears** to be that before the connect to the
2nd account is even started a second attempt to open that mailbox occurs
& generates an error at the users end.. I have been unable so far to
totally eradicate the problem other than getting the user to
"re-arrange" the order that they collect their mail which merely removed
the inability to open the first mail box (they access 3 different
accounts & the 2nd one was the most important so just got them to put
that 1st :))

Are your users getting an error message & are unable to get their mail,
and does it happen all the time or is it intermittent??

Could you please reply to my offlist as I would be interested in
comparing notes & perhaps resolving this.
Phil.

&gt; The exact error in the maillog is...
&gt; 
&gt; Error opening or locking INBOX user=username host=[192.168.123.123]
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From the client end, how does a user ensure that e-mail is not being
&gt; retrieved a second time?  (It is off topic in this respect - sorry.)  Does
&gt; anyone have any experience with Outlook 97-2000 with regard to this very
&gt; annoying trait.  I haven't been able to emulate the problem except through
&gt; having two machines collecting my e-mail.
&gt;
