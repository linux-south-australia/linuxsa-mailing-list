I thought this might be interesting. Nonetheless I do not see any
mention of Adelaide at all. It's such a pity. I have directed a query to
RedHat about this. Furthermore, if one wished to go I wonder how one
proves one is a "member" of LinuxSA for one's discount....

Announcing Red Hat Linux Training in Australia

Red Hat -- the market leader in Linux and open source software, services
and information -- is pleased to announce the first series of
Red Hat Certified Engineer (tm) courses in Australia.

The Red Hat Certified Engineer Program (RHCE) -- the leading Linux
certification -- is exactly what you need to build your skills and your
confidence. You'll learn through a comprehensive, performance-based
certification program, taught by certified Red Hat Trainers.  And you'll 
be the first among your peers to earn the internationally recognised 
RHCE qualification.

                         -oOo-

ABOUT THE RHCE PROGRAM

With the Red Hat Certified Engineer Program, you'll get the training you
need straight from the source -- certified Red Hat experts. Through
intensive, hands-on courses, you'll learn critical Linux skills,
including how to install and configure Linux and the X Windowing system,
how to conduct comprehensive diagnostics and troubleshooting, coverage
of
standard TCP/IP protocols such as BIND, Samba, and NFS to name a few,
and 
advanced configuration of Internet packages including Sendmail, Squid,
Apache and IPChains.  The RHCE also distinguishes itself with its
examination 
process.  Unlike the multiple-choice questions exams practiced with most 
other certification programs, Red Hat has a performed based exam
conducted 
on live equipment.  Tests that accurately gauge your abilities in 
simulated real-world situations.  You'll gain confidence in your skills 
and the confidence of your clients.  The RHCE qualififcation will 
distinguish you as a professional Linux practitioner.

Linux is the fastest growing operating environment.  Learn it from the
company that knows it best, and is the most popular Linux distribution
-- 
Red Hat. You can obtain certification at your own pace through one of
two
certification tracks: The standard track includes several in-depth 
skill-building courses, perfect if you're just getting started as an IT
professional. The Rapid-Track certification (RH300) is ideal for Linux
and 
UNIX system administrators, engineers and/or power users, and will be
the 
initial course offering in Australia.  (Standard track offerings will
become 
available over the next few months - stay tuned!)

The full RH300 course outline is available at
 <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/products/training_course.html">http://www.redhat.com/products/training_course.html</A>

                         -oOo-
