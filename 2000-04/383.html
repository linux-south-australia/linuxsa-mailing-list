Hi list,

I have been playing with wine recently, and am looking for input from
anyone who has a bit of experience.

I have read the FAQ and HOWTO, and have played with wine using both an
existing win partition, and using all Linux dirs. I have had very
limited success, which includes major lockups on the Linux system
requiring hardware reset, and worrying messages about deleted inodes on
the root filesystem. shudder.

Has anyone had spectacular success with usable progs? I am at the point
of needing to decide whether to press on into crocodile territory, or to
declare a pause and let wine develop further.

System is a Mandrake 6.1 desktop Cyrix PR200 64Mb RAM and about 2 Gb
disk to play with. All further details available if needed but I won't
flood the list unless they're needed.

TIA

Bruce
