&gt; Most larger software developers (eg Government) use some sort of disciplined

&gt; 
&gt; Do any open source projects use this kind of thing? (thinking specifically
&gt; of Mozilla, being a large one that started at a commercial software house).
&gt; Are there any Open Source and/or Linux-based Rational Rose-like tools for
&gt; doing this kind of thing? What about a Web-based one?  Most projects that I
&gt; know anything about are more ad-hoc than this, using mailing lists,
&gt; newsgroups, weblogs, and CVS with commented code... Will this kind of
&gt; development last? Will it be successful in developing large projects that
&gt; break new ground as opposed to just mimicing existing commercial software
&gt; innovations?

I think that there is an element of not seeing the wood for the
trees.  For example, every software change to the Linux kernel
has a code walkthrough by a committee of experienced programmers.
But this is done by posting the patch to the linux-kernel mailing
list -- not by assembling a lot of people in a meeting around a
table.

If you list the "forest" elements of software development -- configuration
control, coding standards, design review, etc.  You'd find that all
the larger open source projects do this.

As for integrated tools, there isn't one standard like you might
have on a large software development project.  This actually makes
sense from a productivity point of view.  Most commercial people
work on one project, most open source programmers contribute to
several.  For example, their main project (say Samba or Apache)
will be held up by a missing feature in another project (say kernel-
level oplocks or select()s "thundering herd" behaviour).  They will
then develop that feature for the other project.  Having differing
compulsory development environments between projects would 
make this harder and reduce productivity.

Like the Internet itself it's the protocols, such as file formats,
not the client, such as an editor, that is standardised upon.
No one will criticise you for updating a ChangeLog with vi or
XEmacs or even a hex editor as long as the result is the same.

As projects grow we are seeing more software engineering elements
being developed.  Bugzilla is a good example of this.  Again,
unlike Rational Rose, it can be driven from any HTML client.

I think the major difference is that there isn't a book called
"Open source programming environment and standards".  But if
you look through the mailing list archives for projects, such
standards definately exist in the collective consciousness.

Finally, if you are looking for a proven programming environment,
then XEmacs is probably the closest you will get.  This isn't
unexpected as its development was underwritten by Lucid, the
company that started all this integrated software environment
stuff.  Lucid folded but XEmacs remains (the short story is that
they bet the company on the success of LISP or C++ and prompt
shipment of software from the Richard Stallman's GNU Project,
neither were a reliable commercial proposition).
