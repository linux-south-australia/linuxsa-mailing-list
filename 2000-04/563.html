<H1>bizzarre problem with my dial-in server.</H1>

Hello, all:

I have a strange problem with a SHIVA dial-in server (LanRover) that I
suspect is linux-caused, since the gateway is a linux box, and I have the
exact same problem with a SCO Unix dial-in server on the same subnet.

I dial in to the server, and a Win98 workstation recieves its IP address. I
can ping that IP address, but I cannot ping any other IP. Not the dial-in
server, not the gateway, not anything. I figured that it had to be the
dial-in server, since there is absolutely nothing between the dial-in server
and dial-up workstation. But everything looks like it is configured
correctly on the Shiva box, as does everything on the SCO Unix box. I don't
get it. The shiva server and its clients use IPs within the same subnet
range that LAN-connected workstations use, so there's nothing elaborate
going on.

The linux server is the jack-of-all trades for our IP services. Services
include: packet filtering, gateway, ppp connection to internet, cacheing
DNS, web proxy.

Recently the SCO box was unable to communicate with the linux box to get DNS
info, so I removed DNS lookup support from SCO and it behaved. SCO can
telnet in to linux still, and all other computers can get DNS info okay. Go
figure.

Does anyone have any ideas?
