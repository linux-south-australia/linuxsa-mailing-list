&gt; surprising suggestion: Microsoft should ship a version of Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; ~~~~ SPONSOR: TRANXITION CORP UNVEILS NEW MIGRATION SOLUTION! ~~~~
&gt; The pain of moving to a new PC or OS, especially W2K! Introducing 
&gt; new Personality Tranxport(tm) Professional (PT Pro). PT Pro provides 
&gt; a cost-effective, deep migration solution, across multiple Windows 
&gt; platforms. In minutes, with a few easy steps, capture over 6,500 
&gt; personality items (application settings, documents, desktop interface, 
&gt; etc.). The computer looks and works like the old one and users are 
&gt; immediately productive. Savings over manual migrations are estimated 
&gt; in the hundreds of $$$s per system. PT Pro is safe. Whether migrating 
&gt; 100 or 10,000 machines, it's the only migration solution designed 
&gt; specifically for IT professionals. Available for download at a 
&gt; special introductory price.

&gt; 
&gt; Microsoft Ought To Ship a Linux
&gt; 
&gt; Now that Windows 2000 (Win2K) is shrink-wrapped and on the shelves--
&gt; and has been for more than a month--there won't be much excitement 
&gt; coming from Redmond for a while. And don't tell me about Windows 
&gt; Millennium Edition (ME). I've seen it, and there's not much excitement 
&gt; there. It's not reasonable to expect a Win2K update version any time 
&gt; soon; that was a lot of code, and reworking it won't be an overnight 
&gt; job. How, then, can Microsoft remain in the news, while offering 
&gt; useful new products to its customers? Simple. Ship a version of 
&gt; Linux. Wait, wait, don't go--hear me out. This isn't going to be a 
&gt; Windows NT-bashing or a Linux-bashing piece.
&gt;    Linux is a fascinating OS. Thousands of volunteers have reverse 
&gt; engineered and cloned the UNIX OS, resulting in a robust OS that's 
&gt; completely open source, which means, among other things, that when 
&gt; you get Linux, you also get the Linux source code. Although Linux 
&gt; is not the solves-all tool that many Linux proponents claim, it 
&gt; does have several undeniable advantages. It ships with Apache, the 
&gt; most-used Web server software in the world. It ships with Sendmail, 
&gt; the email program that transfers more Internet email than any other 
&gt; piece of software. It ships with BIND, by far the most-used DNS 
&gt; server software on the planet. With Samba, another free piece of 
&gt; software, you can pop Linux onto an Intel box, run Samba, and mimic 
&gt; an NT server. The network then thinks that you're running NT (or 
&gt; Win2K, for that matter) on that box as a file server when you're 
&gt; actually running Linux. Benchmarks show that some systems actually 
&gt; work more quickly running Samba to mimic NT than they run on NT 
&gt; itself! The point I'm trying to make is simple: Linux is in many 
&gt; ways a worthy competitor or, more likely, complement to Win2K and 
&gt; NT. Many networks that currently use Win2K or NT could benefit from 
&gt; a bit of Linux.
&gt;    The problem with adding Linux to an NT network, however, is the 
&gt; culture shock required for an NT expert to start installing and running 
&gt; Linux networks. The biggest hurdle a Linux tyro faces is probably the 
&gt; complexity of configuring Linux. I've installed the Red Hat, Mandrake, 
&gt; Corel, Caldera, Slackware, Debian, SuSE, and Storm distributions of 
&gt; Linux on a variety of machines. The main difference between each Linux 
&gt; version is its setup program. Some, like Debian's, are very complex; 
&gt; others, like Caldera, Corel, and Mandrake, seek to make putting Linux 
&gt; on a system as easy as putting Windows on a system. But despite the 
&gt; honest efforts of Linux vendors, getting Linux on a given piece of 
&gt; Intel hardware remains more difficult than getting Win2K or NT on that 
&gt; hardware.
&gt;    That's where Microsoft could profit from Linux. Say what you will 
&gt; about Bill and the boys, they've always made a good setup routine--not 
&gt; perfect, but better than the competition. Do you remember when IBM 
&gt; tried to wrest control of the desktop from Microsoft in 1992? OS/2 was 
&gt; a rock-solid multitasking OS that shipped with an impressive array of 
&gt; accessory programs. It lacked third-party made-for-OS/2 applications, 
&gt; but it could run Windows applications well. In my opinion, OS/2's 
&gt; downfall was its terrible setup program. OS/2 performed great once you 
&gt; got it running, but getting it running was a nightmare. In contrast, 
&gt; Windows 3.1 (which shipped 7 days after OS/2 2.0) sported a slick setup 
&gt; program that worked most of the time without much trouble; you just 
&gt; clicked OK a dozen times or so, and your system was up and running.
&gt;    Who, then, could write a better setup routine for Linux? Linux setup 
&gt; programs often have trouble detecting video boards and network 
&gt; interface cards and get a bit of heartburn sniffing out the kind of 
&gt; mouse your system has. Microsoft has hardware detection down cold. 
&gt; Microsoft developers could even write a version of their setup routine 
&gt; that checks to see whether Win2K, NT, or Windows 9x is already on the 
&gt; hard disk and, if it is, the setup routine could simply read the 
&gt; Registry to see what hardware is on the system.
&gt;    But wouldn't it be pointless for Microsoft to create a setup routine 
&gt; for Linux? After all, wouldn't the company have to reveal its source 
&gt; code, giving away whatever clever things the developers came up with? 
&gt; Well, anyone shipping a Linux version must, under Linux's software 
&gt; license, reveal the source code of anything that they do to the base 
&gt; OS. If Microsoft comes up with a kernel change that makes Linux run 
&gt; better on a 16-processor system, then yes, it would have to reveal that 
&gt; code. But setup routines aren't part of the base OS.
&gt;    Furthermore, vendors don't have to ship the source code to Linux 
&gt; add-ons either. Applixware sells an Office-like software suite for 
&gt; Linux and doesn't provide the source code. Likewise, Corel doesn't ship 
&gt; the source code with WordPerfect for Linux. Microsoft could exploit 
&gt; this policy to add another irresistible feature to its version of 
&gt; Linux--setup wizards. Sendmail is powerful, but it's nightmarish to 
&gt; configure. Samba's not as bad, but you can spend a lot of time getting 
&gt; a basic Samba server running securely. Apache and BIND are considerably 
&gt; easier, but they still involve a learning curve. What if MS-Linux 
&gt; included setup wizards or easy-to-use front ends for these essential 
&gt; tools? Linux distributions currently ship with a GUI administrative 
&gt; tool called linuxconf, but in my experience, it's prone to crashing 
&gt; without an explanation when you ask it something difficult. Microsoft 
&gt; need not ship the source code for these wizards, and although some in 
&gt; the Linux community wouldn't be happy about it, no less than Linus 
&gt; Torvalds himself is currently involved in a closed-source project. It 
&gt; clearly makes sense to open some software projects, but in some cases, 
&gt; a closed-source approach is acceptable as well.
&gt;    The list of software that Microsoft could offer to enhance its Linux 
&gt; version could go on and on. Why not make the company's Services for 
&gt; UNIX package more Linux-specific, creating the most NT-friendly Linux 
&gt; on the market? 
&gt;    Okay, put down the poison pens. I hope you'll notice that you 
&gt; received this newsletter the day before April 1, and I admit that my 
&gt; proposal is a bit tongue-in-cheek. But Linux has a lot to offer NT (and 
&gt; vice versa), and I've often wished that the road from NT to Linux was 
&gt; smoother. Microsoft could offer the leadership to make that happen.
