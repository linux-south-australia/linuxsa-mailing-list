I found out about this forum though the Corel Forum. Someone had a technical
problem that couldn't be solved so I "followed" the link to see what it was
all about. I liked it so I hung up my top coat. I have been at this forum
for about 3 months now. I have learned a lot - I managed to get my HP 680C
printer to work in Mandrake 7.0 thanks to you folks! I still can't decide
which version I like the best though. About once a month I clean the system
and install a new version. I started with Corel and soon found it buggy and
limited, then Red Hat 6.1 on a digital prioris -166MMX. I had a 486DX4-100
with win98 running and heard about the Mandrake winlinux install so I have
given it a go for fun. I hope that from what I learn from you folks some day
I'll be in a position to help someone else. It's truly amazing that with the
internet and specifically a forum we can converse and assist each other with
problems regardless of race, color or disability.
Thanks again for the help friends...

&gt; You might be able to answer a question I've always had - how _did_
&gt; you find out about this list?  I've always been curious 'bout how
&gt; furriners discover a geographic-centred mailing list (or is it that
&gt; this list presents outstanding, world-class value? :-).
&gt;
