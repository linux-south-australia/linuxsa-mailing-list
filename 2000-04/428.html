&gt; Greetings, Glen!
&gt; It appears we DO need that LUGSA session on partitions.
&gt; 
&gt; You said "put Swap near the middle of your drive".
&gt; 
&gt; Consider the standard-these-days 8.4G IDE drive:
[snip]

the trouble comes when you attempt to define the logical geometry against the
physical geometry.

you have no way of knowing the 'centre' of the drive is half way through it's
logical sectors. That, is often a bad assumption. For awhile, the first 16
tracks of a drive were  physically in the centre of it to improve on access
speeds for OS's that had their directory tables at the beginning of the logical
sectors.

There is no such thing for instance as cylinders heads and fixed sector lengths
on a modern drive, a 'head' might for instance comprise of 32 read coils. The
visualisation that we have of fixed sectors per track, is inconsistent with the
reality of the drive, physical tracks on the outer edge have quite a deal more
than '64' logical sectors, and the physical sectors (can) contain a great deal
more than 512 bytes. The only thing you can be sure of in optimising access
speeds is that logical sector n is almost always in close proximity to logical
sector n+1. Where they are physically, is anyone's guess and it changes on each
model and release of any hard drive. As a guide, logical sector n+1 for
instance is most often several sectors away from physical sector n+1. And is
tuned by the oem to account for bandwidth..

As far as partitioning is concerned, the only hard and fast rule that must be
applied is that all boot code for all operating systems must be completely
contained within the first 8gig logical sectors of the drive, else, it is
impossible for the bios of an ibm-pc to access it.
