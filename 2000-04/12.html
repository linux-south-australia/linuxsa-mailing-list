&gt;Durham, NC -- MSNBC News Services
&gt;
&gt;"OpenBSD to merge with RedHat"
&gt;
&gt;Linux vendor Red Hat Inc. (Nasdaq: RHAT) announced today it will
&gt;acquire secure OS maker OpenBSD in a deal involving Red Hat
&gt;shares. OpenBSD, widely regarded as the world's most secure
&gt;operating system, will be merged with Red Hat Linux, the market
&gt;leader in Linux distributions. The new company will be called Rad
&gt;Hat Labs.
&gt;
&gt;Said Red Hat CEO Robert Young "The Linux mascot is a penguin and
&gt;OpenBSD's is a blowfish.  Both of these are marine animals so it
&gt;really was a natural pairing.  In the same way that the ocean covers
&gt;over 75% of the surface of the earth, we hope to gain at least 75%
&gt;of the operating system marketplace.  Also, because of the strength
&gt;of the US dollar in comparison to the Canadian dollar we were able
&gt;to pick them up for a song."  Said de Raadt of the purchase "I tried
&gt;to get them to pay me in Krugerrands but had to settle for stock".
&gt;The exact purchase price has not been disclosed. Red Hat shares closed
&gt;Friday at 42-3/8.
&gt;
&gt;According to industry analyst Mudge of L0pht @Stake the corporate image
&gt;was a negotiating stumbling block. "I tried to convince them to
&gt;call it GrayHat OpenBSD but that didn't fly."  Young told us "That's
&gt;just not the image we're going for.  We're thinking more along the
&gt;lines of the OpenBSD blowfish wearing a backwards red baseball cap
&gt;to give it a real rebel edge."  There will be a few changes at
&gt;Red Hat as well.  Reportedly, `Rhad Labs' will be changing its name
&gt;to `deRaadt Labs' in honor of OpenBSD's founder.  And speaking of
&gt;the Labs, Alan Cox had the following to say "I've admired the
&gt;OpenBSD security model for some time now and look forward to
&gt;working with Theo."
&gt;
&gt;The new merged operating system will also be released under the Rad Hat
&gt;Community Source License. Young was quick to point that the new 15 page
&gt;source license still means business as usual for developers
&gt;and users. "Whatever you could do with the source code before, you can
&gt;still do under the new license", said Young. "It's just that corporate
&gt;buyers didn't take us seriously with the GPL or the BSD licenses. Now
&gt;that they have to spend serious cash on lawyers to interpret this thing
&gt;for them, they view us as a real software vendor."
