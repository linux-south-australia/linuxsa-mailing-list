Carl,

    You need to be a little more precise at this.  Exactly what happens.

Does kpppd "die" after contacting the host?  If that is the case, the
you
need to add to your /etc/ppp/options file "noauth" without the inverted
commas.  What is happening is that you are using PAP protocol and the
ISP is
not identifying itself.  This means that eventually kpppd rejects the
connection.  Please read the references.  It will give you some
understanding of what is going on when you contact the Internet.  If you
are
in GUI, which I think you probably are, you can use kedit or equivalent,
or
if in text mode use vi(m).  You have a wealth of documentation on your
system already if you installed everything.  I don't insult you by
saying
RTFM (read the fine manual).

    References:    1.    man pppd

Cheers,   Rick

Subject: HELP ME! I'm new at this


&gt; Hi everyone, I've just installed Linux on my PC. After a
&gt; little messing about I think I've got it. Having a history
&gt; in Macintosh and recently in Windows, Linux's way of
&gt; thinking is quite different. Here's where I'm having
&gt; trouble... How do I setup and run Wine? (the Windows
&gt; emulator) and secondly, I cant seem to change the proxy
&gt; settings in the Netscape Communicator that came in the
&gt; distribution. I have tried CorelLINUX 1.1 and I currently
&gt; have Mandrake 5.2 installed with the KDE GUI. I have setup
&gt; the PPP dialer and the modem is connecting fine to the ISP,
&gt; but Netscape, or any other mail or browser isn't talking to
&gt; the ISP. Hope someone can help me.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
&gt; Carl
