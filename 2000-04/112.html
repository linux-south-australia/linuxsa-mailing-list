Although this is a Sydney event, I thought it's existence may be of some
interest to some list members...

Subject: [debian-au] Reminder: Corel Linux Breakfast tomorrow


&gt; A reminder that Corel is hosting a breakfast session in Sydney
&gt; tomorrow morning. I recall Nils Lohner originally got in touch
&gt; through this list, and of course Corel are keen to hear from
&gt; debian users.
&gt;
&gt; Conrad.

&gt; [
&gt; This is a repeat of the original invitation Jamie forwarded a little
&gt; while ago. The name of the building is corrected. Note that there's
&gt; room for 150 people so don't feel shy about turning up.
&gt;   -Conrad.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Just following up an earlier email from Patrina Gaskin of Corel.
&gt;
&gt; This should be a pretty good event. This is the day that Corel
&gt; releases their OfficeSuite 2000 for Linux, and also they will
&gt; be releasing other products for Linux (from memory one of their
&gt; photo packages)
&gt;
&gt; This should be a fairly open forum, with lots of opportunity
&gt; for questions / answers.

&gt; "As you will know Corel Corporation is committed to Linux Development and
&gt; the open source community, basing our Linux OS on the Debian 2.2 Kernel
&gt; and porting our windows applications to the Linux platform."
&gt;
&gt; "We have just had confirmation that Dr Michael Cowpland, CEO Corel Corp,
&gt; will be in Sydney April 6th so I would therefore like to host an
&gt; exclusive breakfast presentation with the Sydney Linux Group."
&gt;
&gt; "I know Dr Cowpland would be thrilled to meet the group and hear of the
&gt; developing Australian Linux market and your group may also be interested
&gt; to hear our plans for the future Linux development."
&gt;
&gt; The Holme building at the Sydney University
&gt; from 7:30-9am
&gt; Thursday 6th April
&gt;
&gt; (The Holme building is near the Footbridge. You can either take
&gt; a short bus trip up from central, a fair walk from Redfern station, or
&gt; park in the streets and cross by the footbridge over Parramatta
&gt; road, or, of course, cycle).
&gt;
&gt; Suggested format
&gt; 7:30-8am    People arriving - light breakfast available
&gt; 8am-8:30    Dr Cowpland present on Corel Linux developments.
&gt; 8:30-9am    Feedback / Open discussion / Q&A
&gt;
&gt; Jamie.
