Hmmm, perhaps bad form to respond to my own email, but ...

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I have been looking at packet traces with Ethereal to try to track down why
&gt;a web site is slow to load, and basically, lots can be seen with Ethereal.
&gt;
&gt;However, an oddity that I am seeing is that the IP datagrams for the
&gt;requests seem to originate from two places. I have a trace from near the
&gt;web server and a trace from the client.
&gt;
&gt;What I am seeing is most of the request (tcp segments and HTTP requests)
&gt;come from 203.16.76.8, which is an Internode transparent proxy server, but
&gt;an occassional request come directly from the client (dialled into
&gt;Internode) and then the server (NATed behind a firewall) and the client get
&gt;into a RST ACK war.

I am also seeing another interesting piece of behaviour. It seems that the
Internode proxy is slow sometimes in responding, probably because it is
still waiting on the server to deliver the data.

However, instead of ACKing the client's request, it stays silent. The
client then retransmits (after about 3 seconds), and the server ACKs fairly
quickly after that.

&gt;Can anyone comment on thie behaviour?
&gt;
