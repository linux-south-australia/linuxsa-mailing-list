Jeremy,

There are two parts to your question: Part 1 concerns DNS; and part 2 relates
to SMTP.


DNS
===

DNS is an internet convenience.  It's not necessary, and in fact was invented
somewhat late in the piece.  When a program wishes to create an IP connection
to another program it must provide the IP address of the computer that the
other program runs on.  IP addresses are always 32 bit numbers, and are
generally expressed using a four-part dotted number, for example 203.2.124.2.
Numeric addresses are not so easy to remember and so DNS provides a way to
associate a name with a number and vice versa.  DNS also provides a hierarchy
of names, that is it provides domains with names "under" those domains.

The DNS is a database.  You provide a key and type of record; if there's an
entry for that matches you get the data.  For example you might ask for the
address for eden.adam.com.au.  (It's 203.2.124.2.)  There are many types of
records.  Four common types are A (address), NS (nameserver), CNAME (alias)
and MX (mail exchanger).

The DNS has a root, in which all top level domains are recorded.  A number of
nameservers retain a distributed database containing all records for the root.
When you want to find an address for a name, say eden.adam.com.au, you must
first look at the right-most part of that name, au, and find a server which
can resolve names under it.  You can query any of the root servers and find
NS (nameserver) records for the au domain.  You then query to find the A
(address) records for those nameservers -- you do that because you need to
know the address of a computer before you can access it using IP.  Repeat the
process, using any of the au nameservers, to find the nameserver for com.au,
and again for adam.com.au.  Now you know which server (or servers) can answer
requests about eden.adam.com.au.

If you want to maintain your own nameserver for a domain you need to correctly
configure a machine to respond to requests for that domain, and you need an
appropriate record to be entered in the database for domain under which you
domain would appear.  If you want to register the domain je.com.au you can't:
it's already taken.  You could have jeremy.com.au or ervine.com.au -- if the
owner of com.au permits it.

You need to find the registrar (ie the organisations responsible for specific
domains) who is authorative for the domain you want to be registered under.
I shan't try to second guess you by telling you who has authority for any
particular domain, but as a hint you can ask AltaVista "who is the registrar
for some domain?".  I expect that the registrar you need to talk to has a web
site with instructions for you to follow.

Different registrars have different requirements for domains appearing under
their domain.  Most are likely to require you to have the legal right for the
domain.  (Don't waste your time trying to register cocacola.id because you'd
surely be dragged through the Indonesian courts and ultimately lose.) The
registrars are also likely to expect you to have one, or maybe even two,
correctly configured, running and accessible nameservers.  This means you must
configure a nameserver for the domain you want before you request that name,
and it must be available for the registrars to test.  They might test it
immediately; they might test it later.  If your nameserver is not on a
permanent link you probably cannot have the domain.  (This is sensible: what
point is there in having a domain if nobody can access that domain's
nameserver?)  I doubt anybody cares, or even could find out, whether your
nameserver is on the end of a T1 link or on a 300bps modem.  You should be
find just so long as the nameserver is correctly configured and it can be
queried.  A permanent 56k modem would be more than suitable for most low-volume
domains.

All nameservers MUST have a fixed IP address.

When you are planning a domain you should attempt to have more than one
nameserver and on more than one network.  Perhaps you might have one nameserver
on Telstra's network and one on MCI's.  This provides redundancy in case of
network failures.  You decide which nameservers will be primary or secondary
for your domain.  It's probably not of great importance.  If you have a
permanent link your ISP will probably be willing to act as a nameserver for
your domain.  This is a good idea because it provides protection against your
link being down, but is insufficient if your ISPs link is down.  You should
still try to find other places to have more nameservers.

Once you have registrered your domain you can create any A records that you
wish.  You could have one machine with many names, or many different machines
sharing the same name, or different machines with different names.  You can
have sub-domains.  To create a name, such as www.your.domain, add an A record
for www.your.domain.  To create a sub-domain, say hidden.your.domain, add an
NS record.  (Remember to also create an A record for the nameserver.)


SMTP
====

Talking about mail to <A HREF="mailto:me@something.whatever">me@something.whatever</A>: Let's assume that the mail will
be transported using SMTP.  This is the dominant mail transport today.  In
earlier times that message would have been delivered to a machine named
something.whatever.  The DNS would have been consulted to find an A record
for the machine and the message would have been transmitted directly to that
address.  Now we have a layer of indirection, whereby something.whatever might
be a mail domain.  Modern mail transports now consult the DNS for a MX record,
and there can be many of them.  Each MX record has a numeric priority, with
smaller numbers being more important.  Each MX record refers to a computer,
and there must be an A record for that computer.  Each computer is tried in
priority order until the message can be delivered to one of them.  That
computer, if it is not the final computer, is responsible for delivering the
message to the next hop.

As with DNS, most ISPs are likely to be willing to collect and on-forward
email for their permanent customers.  You do need to write these
mail-exchangers into the DNS for that domain (so it's vitally important to
have a clear understanding as to who will, and who will not, act as an MX.)

If no MX record exists for the "host" part of an address, mail transports fall
back to the old method.  That is, they look for an A record.  If there's
neither MX nor A records the mail cannot be delivered.


I hope this has been educational for you.

Regards,

David
