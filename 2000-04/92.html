Jeremy!

&gt; If I decide to build a web/email server, and have it connnected to the internet
&gt; permenantly via a 56k modem, am I able to host a www.something.whatever site
&gt; on this server through the modem linux if I have a static IP ??

Yes. Actually there's nothing stopping you from hosting one on a
non-static IP, it's just that noone would know where to find it :-P

&gt; If so, during the domain name registration, which server is the Primary and
&gt; Secondry DNS servers : mine or my ISPs ???

If you can convince your ISP or anyone else with a name server to act as
a secondary server for you then that is the secondary DNS IP address.
Nonetheless, most of the time the secondary DNS address is another one
of your OWN IP numbers pointing at a machine set up as a Secondary DNS
Server (see below).

&gt; How do I have it so when somebody
&gt; goes to my www.something.whatever site in their browser it finds my server ....
&gt; and how is it when somebody sends an email to <A HREF="mailto:me@something.whatever">me@something.whatever</A>, it gets
&gt; to my server ???

You run a Dynamic Name Server such as BIND or Microsoft's DNS Service
(:-)).

Without going into super-technicalities of name servers here's a run
down:

1) Eventually the root servers or another server points a DNS query at
your own DNS server

How does this happen?

The domain name space is organised in a hierachy similar to the file
system itself. There's the root servers, then servers underneath it,
then servers underneath the servers...in a DNS name like
www.senet.com.au the hierachy is:

[root server] = not often specified but it always exists
[au server] = one of the Australian root servers
[com server] = one of the Australian com servers (Australian becase it's
to the left of the au and root, get it]
[senet's server] = this is the server that will tell you the "correct"
address

If a server cannot find either:

* the actual address
* the next server address in the hierachy

You'll get a DNS lookup failed. For example, there's no such domain as
www.senet.cim.au. The root server will return an Australian root
server's address, but there's no such domain under that as "cim" so it
returns a fail. Get it?

Hyper simplified, if I lookup www.netcraft.com.au, my resolver (the
thing that does DNS queries) could go about it like this:

i) Ask the ROOT name server (for au)

It says "I don't know the exact address" but the "com.au" might

ii) Ask au for a domain name called "com"

It says "Aha....I have an address for com"

ii) Ask "root-&gt;au-&gt;com" (for netcraft)

It says "Aha....I have an address for netcraft"

iii) Ask "root-&gt;au-&gt;com-&gt;netcraft" (for www)

It says "Aha...I have an address for www"

***

And voila...I've found the correct IP address. Essentially resolving a
DNS query (getting 203.11.90.1 out of www.senet.com.au or 203.20.69.66
out of www.rebel.net.au) is a case of recursively looking down a
hierachy until you either find what you want. If you DON'T find what you
want it can be for one of two reasons:

* somewhere your request timed out significantly enough for your
resolver to conclude that you're not going to get an answer

* a name server along the line stated that it can't find what you're
looking for

In my experience the first is highly unlikely...most modern resolvers
and systems wait around long enough for some DNS server to reply "That
doesn't exist...you're looking for a name that doesn't exist".

You should be aware that your own resolver and any DNS server can
"cache" various names. This speeds the process up. For example, if you
constantly are looking up *.*.com.au then you more than likely already
have the Australian com server's address cached...why?

* it makes it faster - you don't have to send a DNS query to the root
server, then to the AU root server[s]
* it reduces network traffice - this is a Good Thing [tm]; the Internet
is already slow enough

Now that I've vaguely explained how DNS works, let's look at the servers
themselves.

DNS SERVERS

Put simply a DNS server translates nice domain names like
www.netcraft.com.au into IP addresses.

A DNS stores a number of different types of records, common ones include
[I am going to use BIND's terminology seeing this is a Linux list]:

SOA

Start of Authority Records. These administrivial records contain such
things as who to contact if you have a glitch with the web-site, the
postmaster and other bits and pieces (consult BIND'S docs).

A records

Address records. These map a name to an IP address.

eg.

www.senet.com.au IN A 203.11.90.1

(incidentally the IN says that it's an Internet Style Address)


CNAME records

These are essentially like aliases (alii??). So I could say:

mail.senet.com.au IN CNAME www.senet.com.au

Which really says, once you've gotten this far look up the address of
www.senet.com.au which is 203.11.90.1


MX records

These are mail exchange records. They point to your mail server[s].
These records are slightly more complex than the previous two. An
example being:

www.senet.com.au IN MX 10 mail.senet.com.au

Says that mail.senet.com.au is a mail server for www.senet.com.au at
preference 10. The preference exists because you can have multiple mail
exchange records and your mail program will select which one to send to
with these values. Explanations of exactly how are beyond this e-mail.


PTR records

These are reverse map addresses. They reverse map. An example is:

1.90.11.203.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR www.senet.com.au

First thing to note is that the IP addresses are essentially reversed
(203.11.90.1 goes to 1.90.11.203) and that there is a special domain
(in-adddr.arpa) which maps ALL registered reverse mappings. Just be
aware that these exist....


SO...I hope this answers some very basic questions. When you consult
BIND'S documentation you'll find you can do lots of wonderful things
like:

1) Set up multiple db (BIND config files)

If you managed 100 IP addresses and 200 DNS names, then your
configuration file could easily extend past 500 lines...finding one
thing in this could be like finding a needle in a haystack...and DNS,
being numbers, is prone to accidentally typing things like 204.11.90.1
(instead of 203...) and then suddenly and inexplicably not working...


2) Log huge amounts of information

Why? Because you can and because it can be the only way to work out why
something isn't working...or you might suspect your DNS server has been
cracked/hacked....


PRIMARY OR SECONDARY

Here comes a fantastic simplification. Primary and secondary servers can
both service a DNS query. However, PRIMARY servers, at least under BIND,
read your configuration files to set themselves up. SECONDARY servers
transfer the information from a primary server. So why not have two
Primary Servers?

It's easier to maintain ONE server's configuration rather than trying to
maintain five supposedly exactly the same configurations. IE,
administratively it's much, much less work.

There's no technical requirement to run more than one name server
although the registration authorities (or maybe even one of the RFC's)
might require you to do so. Running two name servers at least is
recommended primarily so you have peace of mind or you can easily
administer the two servers (you can work on one of them...even turn it
off and DNS will still work).


Anyway, enough of my ranting. 

DISCLAIMER

I don't represent this information to be 100% technically accurate, only
enough to give sufficient detail to interest someone to at least pick up
a book like "DNS AND BIND" by O'Reilly and vaguely understand the
writing contained therein. If I receive a bucket load of requests to
make this more formal, I'll LateX it and submit it as a "tip" to the
web-site....

&gt; If anybody is familiar with this entire process and doesn't mind explaining
&gt; it to me, or pointing me in the right direction, any help would be very much
&gt; appreciated.
