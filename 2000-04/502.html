Update:

Just realised my first mistake is that I have upgraded to a non-existant kernel.
the version I have upgraded to is 2.2.15 source from the Mandrake cooker rpms
but 2.2.15 has not been released (wonder how they got this version number)
should have stuck with 2.2.14-4 :-)

Matt.



Hi folks, well what a wonderful few days I have had, I run Mandrake 7.0-2. First
I decided to upgrade my XFree86 server to version 4 (that took quite a bit of
fiddling)  things seem to be working fine on that front now (though for some
reason I cannot run make xconfig?!) .Which brings me to what I tehn decided to
do.  I wanted to install VMware and tried to do so but I couldnt on Mandrake as
the current running kernel version is different from the kernel header version
(why is this?)  So I decided to recompile my kernel from the latest stable
source (2.2.15).  Things seemed to go ok (other than having to run make
menuconfig instead of xconfig)  I did a make dep, make clean, make bZimage, make
modules, make modules_Install and then moved the image to /boot and copied the
system map to /boot also and reconfigured lilo.  I then rebooted and gpot a few
errors like saying wrong major or minor number when trying to mount my vfat
drives.  found this was because I needed to upgrade to the latest version of
supermount and also cos I had compiled modular support for vfat instead of
having it as default.  So now that is fixed.  Now to the main problem......

Well I saw on freshmeat.net that the latest NVIDIA XFree86 4  drivers were out
and having a TNT card(I am a gamer :-) ) decided to download the source rpms and
build new i586 optimised rpms.  the first one went smoothly with no errors.  the
second file which uses kernel source/headers as part of the build process I
assume as it is called NVIDIA_kernel-0.9.src.rpm came up with thousands of
errors during the rpm -ba process.  I tried make and sh install.sh on the source
also and it gave the same errors (too many to list here)  The final errors were
ERROR1 and ERROR2 Failed.  Has anyone got any ideas what is wrong or what I need
to post here on the list to give you more of an idea?  Anyone tried installing
these drivers on a mandrake 7 system yet?

hope someone can help
