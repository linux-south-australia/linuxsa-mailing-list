You may require an additional switch in either your pppd command (if you use
one) or your /etc/ppp/options file. I had a similar problem until I added
the option:

	noipdefault

Everything seemed OK after that.

&gt; Subject: 	PPP Problems
&gt; 
&gt; Hi all.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been noticing a few problems with my PPP link lately. Namely,
&gt; when I connect I get an email from my ISP's server to the following 
&gt; effect:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is to let you know that at the time this email was sent to you, 
&gt; &gt; you were using the SLIP server with an incorrect IP address of 
&gt; &gt; 192.168.1.1 instead of the 203.56.205.22 IP address that was issued to
&gt; &gt; you when the SLIP server started.
&gt; 
&gt; It would seem that the PPP system (at my end) is attempting to
&gt; use the IP address assigned to ETH0 (my internal network).
&gt; 
&gt; This problem does not happen all the time, however.  It seems to 
&gt; happen about half of the time.  My ISP implements a kind of
&gt; "redirection" service to work around the problem so I can still
&gt; access web sites, but things like FTP and RealAudio fail dismally.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone out there know of this problem, and/or know of the
&gt; solution to it.
&gt; 
&gt; I configured PPP using the netcfg tool with RedHat 6.0, and currently
&gt; use '/sbin/ifup ppp0' to bring it up.  This is called from my 
&gt; masqdial server, but the log shows that this is the command that was
&gt; called.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Adam
