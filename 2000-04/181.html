<H1>Fw: Linux Virus Scanners?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
Kaspersky Labs in Russia make AVP Pro, which can run *on* Linux, but scans
for predominately *PC* viruii (or viruses. Whatever - I really don't feel
like a pedantic arguement and the plural of virus :). It also runs on
FreeBSD, OS/2 and lesser known operating systems like
Win-something-or-other.

<A HREF="http://www.avp.ru/">http://www.avp.ru/</A>

AVP Pro seems to have a reasonable reputation on the Net, from the basic
research I did. I know that some people are very particular about virus
scanners, but I wanted one that would pick up the most common PC viruses
(Happy99.exe etc), and this picked up all the common ones I had received
lately.

It also integrates with Sendmail, and runs as a daemon and seems fairly kind
on system resources. It does not do real-time scanning (ie check each file
as it is written), as far as I know. I would be a valuable addition to a
Linux server that is used as a mail gateway and/or file server in a
predominately MS based PC client environent. On the downside it does not
seem to find Mac viruses, at least not when they are packed into hqx files.
It does unzip files and look inside them, seem to find word macro viruses
etc.

 I would not say that I recommend it, as it is up to the implentor of an
anti-virus policy and implementation to make up their own minds about what
is most suitable in their environment. I am just saying it is available.

Regards,

 Andrew Speer
