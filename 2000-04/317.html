Oops, forgot to address the list ...

&gt;    eg:
&gt;       $ ipchains -A input -p TCP -d &lt;attackers IP&gt; ! www

No, this won't do it, but as you've admitted that it's a CS project,
you really are going to have to find out _why_ this doesn't work
(heck, otherwise you may turn out to be "just be another qualified
graduate", and there's enough of those around already).

However, I'm sure we (the list) are willing to help walk you through
the problem in order to find a solution.

&gt; 1. Is this correct?

No.

&gt; 2. If I apply this rule straight away I assume it will not take place
&gt;    until I reboot. Is this true or is there a way to start the rules
&gt;    without a reboot eg kill -HUP ?

This is UNIX, not NT.  If you apply this rule, it will be effective
immediately.  If you reboot, _unless you have made provisions
otherwise_, you will lose this rule and it will have to be re-applied.

&gt; Any other advice regarding techniques to stop DoS SYN attacks would be
&gt; cool :)

Literally, this depends on your goals and what you're trying to achieve.
SYN Cookies are supposed to reduce the amount of resources consumed by a
SYN attack, and (I think) are enabled by default on kernels these days.
Also bear in mind that most SYN attacks have forged source IP addresses,
so autoblocking IP addresses is not much of a solution.
