<H1>2 minor problems</H1>

G'day all,

	I have two minor problems. 

	1.	Every time after I do a print job, my printer daemon dies.  I've learnt
to cope with it by simply putting a printtool icon on the panel and
restarting lpd after I order a print job.

	I can't figure out what is going on.  It is only a minor problem, but it
irritates me a lot.  I would be very grateful if someone could point me in
the right direction.

	As an aside, to make public my reply to Pete re pppd dying unexpectedly,
one needs to put "noauth" (without inverted commas) in the /etc/ppp/options
file.  This is to stop the PAP protocol being stopped by the lack of
identification by the ISP site.

	2.	I am setting a small network of at present 2 computers, soon to be 5.
(What the **?! does one person want with 5 computers, I hear you say).
Some are old boxes being recycled.  I want to run some as Windows boxes and
use Samba.  I have done a huge amount of reading, including Richard
Sharpe's excellent book, but I am not sure whether I can just run Samba or
whether I also need NFS as well.  I have gotten the two computers speaking,
as I can ping each other from the other one.  Will Samba be enough, or is
there more to it.  I presume I now need to set my configuration files.

Many thanks,   Rick
