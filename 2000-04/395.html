Hi...

It VERY much depends on what windows utils/apps your trying to run.
Some complex software may run with no problems, but other simple software
may not run at all.

Check the wine web site for a rather large list of  how well windows
software titles run under wine.

&gt; Hi list,
&gt;
&gt; I have been playing with wine recently, and am looking for input from
&gt; anyone who has a bit of experience.
&gt;
&gt; I have read the FAQ and HOWTO, and have played with wine using both an
&gt; existing win partition, and using all Linux dirs. I have had very
&gt; limited success, which includes major lockups on the Linux system
&gt; requiring hardware reset, and worrying messages about deleted inodes on
&gt; the root filesystem. shudder.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone had spectacular success with usable progs? I am at the point
&gt; of needing to decide whether to press on into crocodile territory, or to
&gt; declare a pause and let wine develop further.
&gt;
&gt; System is a Mandrake 6.1 desktop Cyrix PR200 64Mb RAM and about 2 Gb
&gt; disk to play with. All further details available if needed but I won't
&gt; flood the list unless they're needed.
&gt;
&gt; TIA
&gt;
&gt; Bruce
