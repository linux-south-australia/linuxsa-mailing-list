Can't remember where I found the link to this (in fact, it could have been
on this list...), but there is a Victorian Company doing approximately what
I described earlier under the "An Idea..."  thread... Their address is
<A HREF="http://www.dcbox.com">http://www.dcbox.com</A> ... they look pretty interesting, although I don't
think they have the same level of automation that i described (then again,
they are in the real world, as opposed to my dream world...)

I've been correponding with them for a few days now, and they seem to be
heading in the same direction as what I described, but they are finding that
there are more differences between customers than they hoped for, and the
time spent on support (mainly discussion) is greater than hoped for...

Anyway, have a browse of their site, and see what you think...

PS if you want to email me direct, please post to my home account at
<A HREF="mailto:richardrussell@mail.com">richardrussell@mail.com</A> rather than this, my work account...

Thanks
