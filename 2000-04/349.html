&gt; Concerning UDP port 137....
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have an explanation for this:

Most likely an MS-type operating system that doesn't realise DNS !=
WINS.  I gave up logging port 137-139 a long time ago, as you just
get so much rubbish from it.

&gt; This kind of thing seems like what the MS mob would do to
&gt; "differentiate their product in the market place" -- i.e. to
&gt; undermine open standards.

I think those are seriously unfounded rumours ... :-)  (Anyone
here remember the "Aardvark" (from memory) code in Win 3.1?)

&gt; Question 2:
&gt; Why do some browsers try to read the file "favicon.ico" in
&gt; the browsed directory and the / directory?

IE feature (introduced around 4? definitely 5).  In their bookmark
file they have tiny icons alongside the site's name.

&gt; But when I try to read <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico">http://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico</A>
&gt; I get:
&gt; 
&gt; "Sorry, there is no microsoft.com Web page matching your request."

There should be one for Microsoft, but I'm not sure where it's
located, and also it may be triggering to the fact that you're
using a non-IE browser (I've come across some pages there before
that certainly behave differently depending on what browser string
you supply).  From memory, IE searches from the basename of the
URL all the way back to the root for the favicon.ico file.  I think
this is detailed in BugTraq when it first came out.

&gt; whereas if I try <A HREF="http://slashdot.org/favicon.ico">http://slashdot.org/favicon.ico</A>, I get a rather
&gt; amusing result.

That is cute - I hope it causes severe discomfort.  :-)  BTW,
<A HREF="http://www.altavista.com/favicon.ico">http://www.altavista.com/favicon.ico</A> will return a result, but
with a Mime type of text/plain.  IE (in its spack wisdom) will
probably see the ".ico" part of the file name and react to that,
whereas Netscape won't be retrieving the image in the first place.

&gt; Once again, I think this is part of an "embrace and extend"
&gt; policy, i.e. "infiltrate and innovate".

"Mmmmm, strangle."

&gt; PS.  In case you knew even less about PC power supplies
&gt; than me, one should never get one of these modern-fangled
&gt; ATX power supplies for computers that run linux and are
&gt; supposed to come back up after a power failure

Too late :-(  I wouldn't mind an answer to this as well.
As an additional note, I would never buy an Asus motherboard
for a server again.  I can't cycle between Linux and NT
without a power-cycle (both kernels hang on warm start), and
if the BIOS boot is interrupted for any reason (eg, power dip)
you're taken to a setup screen upon reboot.  Does not make for
a good remote server.
