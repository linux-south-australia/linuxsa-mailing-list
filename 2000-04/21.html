&gt;Hi group,
&gt;
&gt;The problem is that this friend, who lives in Mudgee NSW and does not
&gt;have a lot of money to splash around, has tried to upgrade an old-ish
&gt;IBM pc, and has run into a snag with his new hard drive. The PC is an
&gt;IBM PSV 2410-0H9. He has added more ram (now 32M) and a 6.??Gb hard
&gt;drive. The hard drive is only recognised as 500 Mb, and it seems that
&gt;this may be a BIOS limitation on that machine. Does this ring any bells
&gt;with anyone? 

Sure does.  I had a similar problem with a system I was trying to set up
for a charitable organisation.  Fortunately I was able to just give up and
install Win95 instead (sorry).
It IS a bios problem, plus the way Linux is fussy about conflicts between
BIOS and HD messages, whereas Win95 just doesn't care.  It doesn't care if
you lose all your data later, either :-(
 
Your best bet is a BIOS upgrade:

or

Your post is NOT off-topic.  One attractive feature of Linux is its ability
to work with 'old-fashioned' resources.  Problems such as those you
describe are bound to surface from time to time with
Linux-on-outdated-systems installations.
