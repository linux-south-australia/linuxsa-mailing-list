Hi,

Just to make a change, I'm going to make a no problems post, and wtell you
about my successful upgrade on the weekend.

First a little history on this install, it was a RH 6.0 box, successfully
running, and customised to taste in desktop, and feel of the system. Linux
was on a secondary IDE HDD, lilo did the dual booting between win and
linux.

I completely replaced the computer, but moved the linux drive to the new
PC, the only common piece of hardware was the HDD, and it had the addition
of new types of hardware, including a nertwork card, and a modem. My
thoughts were that an upgrade to RH 6.2 would be the easiest way to
restore Lilo, and account for the new hardware, and also patch to the
latest version of most software. This is only my second RH 6.2 install.

The install of RH was trouble free. It detected corectly my hardware, and
had no errors in the instalation. What impressed me, was that it
recognised the absence of old hardware, and maintained all my old
configuration data, including my name server config. Unlike last time,
when I did RH 5.2 to 6.0 and had a major re-configure job on my hand, this
went smothly, and there were only two minor errors...
I minor problem with the isapnp system, but commenting out the trouble
line seemed to fix that (it might even be legasy from my old hardware).
Named configuration, tho transfered, didn't work completely, but I suspect
the adition of a network card and configuration broke that, it should be a
simple fix.

All my old compiled programs (including Maelstrom) worked fine, without
reconfigureing.

Overall I was impressed bty the ease and lack of trouble with the upgrade,
and so I feel this was definitly the right corse to take, as it saved me
considerably more time and hassle than I anticiparted.

cya
