&gt; What about ext3?  Has anybody tried it?  I want to give it a go on an old

Ext3 still has a lot of bugs in it. Hence the reason it won't make the 2.4
kernels. Reiser is another file system with journalling and it MAY make
the 2.4 series of kernels. I personally have been using it for the last 5
months. I find it very stable and VERY quick. I played around testing
it. I kept pulling the plug on it while it was doing some fairly heavy
disk thrashing. Each time it restarted, took about 12 seconds to resync
and then it was done, working fine. 

I would recommend against both ext3 and reiser in a production system
though. They are not mature enough to be trust worthy. Even though I have
found reiserfs very stable, it doesn't mean in a server environment it
will be.

Cheers,
