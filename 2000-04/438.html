Query about i740 support in SuSE 6.4.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Having just bought SuSE 6.4, I can say that the
graphical install stuff is pretty snazzy -- for the
beginner. I think this will increase acceptance
of SuSE linux among windows users.
It works out whole bunches of things for you without
asking about your hardware.

However, .....

I can't find the support for the Intel i740 card,
which was definitely there in SuSE 6.2 and Mandrake
something. When I try to specify an i740 card, the
SaX program says I have to first install the xi740 module,
which is fair enough, except that there is no such thing
on the CD-ROMs!! What a nuisance if you have an i740 card!


And another thing...
When you install the packages with the new snazzy graphical
install thingy, and you ask to choose your packages one by one,
and if you say you want the "duconv" program added, say, it comes
up with a long list of totally irrelevant installation
dependencies which are obviously incorrect.
It looks like they have bugs here!

Also, whenever I finish with SaX, the screen goes blank and I have
to re-boot the thing to get back control.
And the SVGA X server gives a lot of pin-cushion effect.
Not very nice to look at.

SuSE 6.4 does seem to have some nice new stuff though, like
USB support and SSH.
And of course there's the buggy Netscape that you have to 
immediately replace with a download of the fixed version from SuSE
over the net.

So my initial impression of SuSE 6.4 is that it has some real improvements,
especially for the non-computing-science-graduate user.
But it is disappointing to see that it seems to have a bunch of
bugs that didn't seem to be in SuSE 6.2.

As I always say, computing is still in its medieval era, and era of
chaos and bedlam, and some time in the future, there will be 
standards adherance, bug-free design techniques for hardware and software,
and full documentation of everything.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Question:
Does anyone know where the i740 support in SuSE 6.4 is?
Is it tucked away somewhere?
I've directly checked the right places on the CD-ROMs, I think.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  Has anyone got the USB support for linux 2.2.14 
(or any other linux 2.2.x) working with an actual physical
device connected to the bus?
It would be really neat if this worked.
Then I can go out and buy all those el cheapo USB devices...
