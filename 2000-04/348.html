[Daryl's inability to spell "find"]

&gt; Heh.  Equal brain fade this end.  I can't beleive I didn't pick it as being
&gt; a find command.  I was thinking "there's no '-type' or '-exec' options in
&gt; fsck".  I didn't consider the possibility that it was fsck that wasn't
&gt; right.

For five minutes, I sat staring at it, then typing in the command on
my laptop, then starting at it again, all the while magically translating
"fsck" to "find" - it's only when I cut 'n' pasted that the penny finally
dropped.  Sad.  :-)

&gt; Guess it's time for some more coffee.  ;-)

It's always time for more coffee. :-)

&gt; find /cache ! -type d -exec cat {} &gt; /dev/null \;
&gt; 
&gt; Didn't return any errors, so I guess the files are all readable.  Cute way
&gt; of checking for file readability.  I'll have to remember that one.

I keep a "corrupted" file system (also caused by squid) on my laptop as
a test for a file system scanning utility that I wrote.  "find" above
produces:

cat: /usr/local/squid/cache/0E/DC: No such device
cat: /usr/local/squid/cache/0E/DE: No such device
[etc]

which is not surprising, as the files look like -

[<A HREF="mailto:root@orac">root@orac</A> /root]# ls -l /usr/local/squid/cache/0E/D?
c---r-----   1 8224     8224      32,  32 Jan 30  1987 /usr/local/squid/cache/0E/DC
c---r-----   1 8224     8224      32,  32 Jan 30  1987 /usr/local/squid/cache/0E/DE

Can't even rm them as root, but fsck gives that FS a clean bill of
health.

&gt; So, what do we think?  mke2fs time?

Yup.
