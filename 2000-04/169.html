No, it can get viruses.

There have been some famous UNIX viruses in the past. (Such as the
infamous worm.)
While security is usually decent enough on Linux these days such that a
reoccurence of the worm is unlikely, there are still 'user error'
viruses.

However, UNIX users in the past have generally been more clueful than
Windoze users, and tend not to run untrusted binaries as root. 

A virus executed by root could do nasty things, such as patching the
kernel, etc. and then it could get away with anything.
If a non-priveledged user runs an infected program, then the virus is
limited to userspace, which makes it much easier to track down.

So, don't go around saying "you can't get viruses on Linux", because
then people will go around executing things willy-nilly in the
artificial belief that they have some guardian angel who will stop this
program from doing virus-like things.

Eg:
you run glquake4-DoD that you got from some warez ftp site. You think
you're so 3lit3. You run it, and it says "this program must be run suid
root for gfx acceleration to work.". So, you su to root, and run it.
Unbeknownst to you, the glquake4 binary is actually a wrapper written by
some hacker. It forks off and executes the real glquake4 binary, and
while you're happily blowing away your other elite friends with your
triple-barrel shotgun, the other side of the forked process is patching
tcpd, login and PAM modules and looking for your most recently used
executeables in /usr/local/bin and ~/bin (stuff in /usr/bin and /bin is
probably from a redhat package anyway and would have checksums that
would show them up as modified.)

You finish playing quake4, delete it since it sucked, and go back to
IRC. Some guy asks you for an MP3 encoder, so you dcc him
/usr/local/bin/bladeenc (which is now infected with a virus.)
Now, if he is a more reasonable user, he might not run it as root. The
virus could only modify his ~/bin files, and not /usr/local/bin or the
kernel. But still, it propagates further..(And how was he supposed to
know that bladeenc doens't normally fork?)

I can't see any flaw in that plan.
Both a clueless user and a more clueful user end up with the virus. The
first user is pretty screwed, but the second one has a chance. But then
if one day he executes an infected file while root, then it will be able
to modify his login, tcpd, PAM, etc. too. (And maybe ping hacker
homebase and send a packet with the victims IP address in it if there's
an internet connection.)

&gt; &gt; These would include scanners for PC client servers.
