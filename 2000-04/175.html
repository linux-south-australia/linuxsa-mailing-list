&gt;     I was scanning the Java Development Kit for Linux
&gt; yesterday, and came across a file permission I haven't seen
&gt; before, and wondered what it meant. The actual permission
&gt; looked something like : -r-xs-x--x. What is 's' ?

I don't know about s-x, but if it was -r-x--s--x, it's
setgid on execution, which means it acquires the group
id when executing.

&gt; It was also strangely only set on the "group" permission.

Not particularly.  Sometimes it's handier/safer to have, say, a
directory with group write permissions; with a setgid program
you don't have to run the program in the context of the owner
of the directory in order to write to it.  From memory, setgid
on directories causes files that are created within those
directories to acquire the group ID of the directory, not of
the owner (I think this is a POSIXism).

&gt; (ie. on some
&gt; UNIX networks the bash shell is set "sticky" or always
&gt; loaded in memory because every user on the network needs it
&gt; so it is never swapped out).

That's the sticky bit - "t".  I think with modern VM techniques
the sticky bit has faded from use (it was more prevelant on swap
based architectures), although its meaning on directories is
significantly different - eg "ls -ld /tmp".

&gt; Can someone shed some light on
&gt; what these "other" permissions are, how you set them, and
&gt; what they do?

man 2 chmod, and some small-ish source code supplied with the
system called "kernel".

  Daryl Tester
