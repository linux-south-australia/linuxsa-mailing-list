&gt; while on the other there are a few key

Someone released a "security tool" that was supposed to check if Apache
was open to a certain security problem, which did nothing more than
append bogus entries to your passwd file.  Although it was released in
source form, it was obfuscated enough that the "casual sysadmin" (or
certainly one not versed in C) wouldn't see what the end effects were.
I guess we'll only see a rise in the sorts of things that prey on the
inexperience of admins.

&gt; Whatever the real reasons, it is true that tampered-with code such as
&gt; viruses don't appear to be a problem at all under Linux now.

I like to think that it's just too difficult to elevate your
privileges under Unix - the kernel is small enough and well
beaten enough that there are few flaws to exploit, so for
a virus to gain root it must exploit other setuid programs
(it would have to carry with it a small database of known
vunerable programs and environments with exploits to try).
So if a virus/malicious program does gain a foothold, the most
it can do is trash all files owned as you (hence the cardinal
rule - don't run as root unless you have to).
