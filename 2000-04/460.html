&gt; Does anyone have any experience in directly modifying the shadow file with
&gt; MD5 encryption?

Yes, use "useradd(8)" or "adduser" to manage the password file.  It's
more "portable" (insofar that it probably only works on Linux and a
few other Unix variants), but it will shield you from the intricacies
of file locking, directory creating and all the other fluff that goes
with creating user accounts, especially if the interfaces decide to
change.

&gt; I've installed the MD5 and Crypt::PasswdMD5 modules, and neither seem
&gt; to work.

The crypt MD5 routines are actually built into the standard libc crypt()
function ("info libc crypt" for more information). The "$1$" prefix tells
crypt() to use MD5 instead of the (dis-)standard DES crypt routines.

&gt; I think my problem is with the "salt".  I don't really know much
&gt; about this "salt" concept, or what the "salt" should be in order for the
&gt; encrypted string to be properly recognized by linux.

The salt stops my "secretpassword" from looking like your "secretpassword"
(where "secretpassword" is taken literally).  The salt is created at
password creation time (from some pseudo-random source), and used
to encrypt the password.  As the password is never decrypted (both DES
and MD5 algorithms used are one-way encryptions), the salt is used
to encrypt the plain text password when it comes time to verify the
password, and then the newly encrypted password is compared with
the pre-existing encrypted password.  If they match, then there is a
good chance (also literally) that the passwords match.
