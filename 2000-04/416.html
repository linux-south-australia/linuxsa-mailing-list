I would be guessing hardware (most likely IRQ ) for a complete freeze as
well. It is possible to get some response on I/O only from some NIC 's -
particularly some ne2k clones. If you have an ISA card consider reserving
IRQ in BIOS and make sure you correctly initialise modules with correct
settings. If it one of those plug'n'pray ones that you cannot force into
manual reasonableness then you could be in for some fun.

I had some other fun with DHCP and Samba somewhat unrelated to yours. One of
my Samba boxes is a DHCP client and occasionally changes address after
various shutdowns, moves etc. Ended up having writing a sed script to
extract the correct DHCP IP lease 
and automatically update my hosts file. I also found dhcpd worked better
then pump for me. 

This machine has two nic's one a DHCP client the other a DHCP server, and I
have no problem with either. I did however mess around to get Samba working
reliably as part of an NT domain without using the 'password server = '
option  (ie WINS, automatic linux account creation, NT authentication etc)
however on a peer to peer 98 only option this should not be an issue.

&gt;
&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Today whilst configuring a Linux Fileserver for a small LAN with
&gt; desktops all running win98, i encountered problems with Samba, DNS and
DHCP.
&gt;
&gt; After much stuffing around with DNS and DHCP I finally managed to get
&gt; the system operative so that the Server was giving out DHCP addresses.
&gt;
&gt; After this step and all my win98 desktops were getting IP addresses
&gt; properly I decided to do a ping test from wokstations to server and vice
&gt; versa. When ever I did this the Linux Server would completely freeze,
&gt; and the only way to revive it was to switch off the power.
&gt;

It has been a couple of days now .. are you still having this problem ? If
so, it is fairly unusual for a server to "die" when pinged. I am assuming
you have a fairly generic setup (ie you have not custom built your own
extensions for the kernel or something weird like that - please let me know
if I am wrong !)

The only instance where I have seen behaviour like this is where the NIC
(network card) has had mem/io/irq settings that trample on another devices
space - this can cause weird network problems, but usually only with large
packets and.or heavy traffic - neither of which you seem to have (yet).

It might help if you could send your network card setup. Run the command

ifconfig eth0

To get the config and post it to the list. At the same time, perhaps do a

dmesg

and send that as well. It does not sound like you have more that one network
card, but if so, do an "ifconfig xxx" for each one.

If you are getting desperate it may be worth changing to a new and/or
different network card to try and isolate the problem.


Regards,

Andrew Speer
