Hi I had a great weekend installing Redhat 6.2 and Mandrake7.0-2 and now these
are both humming along fine together along with win98 and winnt4 Server and
win2000 (hey I have to support these windows versions at work so its good to
have them to tinker with!).  My problem that I'm sure someone has a really easy
solution to is that I have a whole directory of files on one of my linux
partitions where the case of the filenames is capital and it should be lowercase
so that when I go to install a program it cannot find the right filename,

Is there a way to change the case of all the files in the directory with just
one command?

thanks in advance

Matt
