Just had a thought related to Matthew's talk the other night...

Most larger software developers (eg Government) use some sort of disciplined
Software Engineering process, such as the Rational Unified Process, and use
UML or something to model the system, and so on and so forth... 

Do any open source projects use this kind of thing? (thinking specifically
of Mozilla, being a large one that started at a commercial software house).
Are there any Open Source and/or Linux-based Rational Rose-like tools for
doing this kind of thing? What about a Web-based one?  Most projects that I
know anything about are more ad-hoc than this, using mailing lists,
newsgroups, weblogs, and CVS with commented code... Will this kind of
development last? Will it be successful in developing large projects that
break new ground as opposed to just mimicing existing commercial software
innovations?

PS: "Real Programmers don't comment their code" type comments will be
/dev/null'd...
