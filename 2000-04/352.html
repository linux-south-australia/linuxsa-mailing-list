&gt; &gt; Does anyone have an explanation for this:
&gt; 
&gt; Most likely an MS-type operating system that doesn't realise DNS !=
&gt; WINS.  I gave up logging port 137-139 a long time ago, as you just
&gt; get so much rubbish from it.

As an alternative to the NTLM (MS web authentication) suggestion made by
Dan, there might be an alternative option.

This may not actually be a browser doing this, but might be a web site
that you are visiting trying to resolve the name of the machine you are
on.

Where I am currently contracting, there is a NT network (with the odd Linux
machine BTW :) which uses a MS DNS server for resolving hosts.  The twist
(and MS value add so to speak) is the addition of the WINSR record in the
reverse mappings for DNS.

What this means is that when a host requests the name for an IP address
(normally looked up by the reverse mapping domain of 
zzz.yyy.xxx.www.in-addr.arpa. for an IP address of www.xxx.yyy.zzz), the
DNS server talks to the IP address and requests one of the NetBIOS names
(in particular number 03, the messenger service) to retrieve the SMB
name of the machine.  From there it tacks on it's configured domain name
for that domain).

What this means of course is that there is either 
  a) a real poor excuse for a MS embrace and extend technique, hiding
    the real protocols in preference for the MS-style protocols,
  b) a really poorly maintained MS based site, or 
  c) I am completely wrong and Dan is right :)

But eitherway it is interesting to see the way that MS can tear the guts
out of open standards and replace it their own proprietary protocols and
most people can't see the difference and give it a big 'DNS compliant' 
tick since they are only looking at the upper layers of network model.

Let's hope the DOJ can come up with an appropriate remedy to ensure that 
vendor tie-in becomes less of a problem... (All without causing *huge* 
amounts of grief with regards to legal precedence).

Regards,

Matthew
