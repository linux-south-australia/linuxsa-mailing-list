Richard,

How about a combination of a Cobalt {Gateway} Cube, a UPS, a auto
changer tape backup unit and microway hub/modem/firewall unit?

Not quite a single box but may fit the bill for a SOHO.

Cheers,

TonyR

Subject: Re: An Idea...


&gt; OK folks, here it is... This is the idea that I have been
&gt; fantasis^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hthinking about for the past year or more...
I
don't

Oh, and the other thing would be that the server itself would not need
a
monitor, mouse or keyboard, or even a video card, thereby saving a few
hundred off the hardware cost, and reducing potential for physical
security
attacks... IMHO, it could also be handy (in some situations) to have
an
internal UPS and maybe even a 4 or 8 port switch built in to the
case...
This makes it more like an all-in-one appliance -- plug power in here,
phone/ISDN/ASDL in here, Ethernet cables in here, turn it on and never
touch
it again, except for the tape changing... Could even mount the whole
thing
in a rack, or a Cobalt-like Cube, or just some funky-looking case...
although, you'd only need to do this when you IPO... :)

I could also imagine (assuming this worked well enough) this idea
extending
gradually to include more and more services, and eventually to allow
value-added apps to be spread around (eg, supposing lots of clients
wanted a
slashdot-like internal discussion board, it would be relatively easy
to set
them all up with one...). Later on, you could try maintaining desktop
machines with this mechanism -- in fact, you could have a complete
hierarchy
of self-maintaining Linux machines, by deploying the database and
tools on a
managed server somewhere... hmmm.... I think I'm getting a little
ahead of
myself here :)

Anyway, I was just pointed to www.e-smith.org (and www.e-smith.net),
who
seem to be doing something vaguely along these lines... although they
appear
more focussed on providing a well-configured, web-managable server
distribution, along the lines of Cobalt -- ie without the
administration
service... It could, however, be a useful admin tool... It appears to
be
GPL'd, too...
