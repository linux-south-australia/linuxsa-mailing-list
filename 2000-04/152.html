&gt; &gt; So why can't my browser do spreadsheet and database operations (not
&gt; &gt; that I particularly want it to - its integrated real email application
&gt; &gt; ain't up to snuff).  People seem to want to push this web paradigm
&gt; &gt; for all its worth.  "All the world's a nail ..."

&gt;
&gt; Give it time :) I think that is taking it to its logical extreem tho. I
&gt; think that was M$'s idea with active desktop, all the internet is just a
&gt; click away, and all in wonderful M$ format. Netscape was the first tho.
&gt;


Hmm ActiveX springs to mind, if you want to be stuck with IE, but hey it can
and does do spreadsheet and database stuff if they handle Automation, well
if there is an ActiveX control out there that does this. And hey add DCOM
and you can do some strange and wonderful things.

Of course this limits you to the M$ OSes, there are rumours that they are
attempting to port it to *nix, but this has been a long standing rumour
(it's in the same vein as "No bugs in our OSes", "It will be delivered on
time", etc you get the point).

Just my voice on the matter anyway.

Rob.
