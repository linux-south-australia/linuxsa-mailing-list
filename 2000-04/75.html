Hi all,
Apologies for not updating the list regarding my progress at recovering the
data which disappeared when I tried to install Caldera Linux on my PC.
I tried everything I could, but got nowhere at first.
I'd tried to be careful, but obviously not careful enough.
I was advised to check out Tiramisu or Lost and Found (By the makers of
Partition Magic).
I tried Tiramisu and initially had no luck in trying to recover anything - I
got a list of files, but when I tried to save them, they all came up as
being incomplete or faulty in some way.
After days of trying various versions I decided it was war and set the
starting sector at somewhere near a third of the total sectors and set the
other parameter - something to do with how hard the program worked at
getting good files - to 0 instead of the default value of 50.
I set it off and did some quality assurance checks on some beer I had in the
fridge.
Next morning, guess what - most of the files were listed in the results
panel and somehow when I saved them to another drive and checked them out,
the ones I needed were fine. Some didn't work out, but the important ones
were fine.
I borrowed a tape drive and SCSI card from someone at work, then backed up
the files onto it.
I then made two copies of the files on separate partitions on my hard drive
and was about to copy everything (about 800 Meg) onto floppies when my wife
suggested I was getting paranoid...
Anyway, the thing I wanted to stress to all was that Tiramisu is very good -
if you use it right.
So, if you're stupid like me and manage to lose your files, I recommend you
try Tiramisu.
Regarding Linux.
When I rebuilt the hard drive, I made a 2 gig partition (from 2 to 4 gigs)
for when I can face Linux again.
I will be getting back to it, but for now I've got some sucking up to my
missus to do.
Thanks for reading this and sorry about it being so wordy.
Thanks again
