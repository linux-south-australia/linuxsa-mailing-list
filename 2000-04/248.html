I'm sure that there would be literally thousands of companies who would
benefit from having a Linux server configured to perform these kinds of
generic tasks... Does anyone out there administer multiple Linux boxes for
different sites? Do you find that you repeat basically the same tasks on
each one?

&gt; Some followup:
&gt;
&gt;   Richard&gt; I must preface this by saying that I'm not exactly a guru
&gt;   Richard&gt; sysadmin, in fact, I'm not much of a sysadmin to speak of
&gt;   Richard&gt; at all...
&gt;
&gt;   Richard&gt; The Market: Any business, organisation or group who wants a
&gt;   Richard&gt; basic, simple server. They need things like SMB, SMTP,
&gt;   Richard&gt; POP3, IMAP, HTTP, Proxy/Cache, Firewall, DHCP, DNS, etc,
&gt;   Richard&gt; etc, etc -- all things that most servers can do (NT,
&gt;   Richard&gt; NetWare, Unices, Linux).
&gt;
&gt; I know of the following 'real' examples.. (while I don't want to add
&gt; confusion by adding company names, I quite happy to add pass on
&gt; details to get something like this off the ground).
&gt;
&gt; Company A: CAD design company, uses NT (and NT networking). Has
&gt; clients in USA and with dialup account has to wait 45 min while large
&gt; work files are transfered via email.  Have heard of Linux, but arn't
&gt; interested in another OS.. Have hear about 'firewalls' and would like
&gt; one so that machines won't be locked up while transfers are in
&gt; progress.  (Read.. mail spooler)
&gt;
&gt; Company B: Have a single dialup account on boses machine.  Have Windows
&gt; network using IP (rather than NetBeui).
&gt; [Solution: LRP box serving the dialup.. dial on demand?]
&gt;
&gt; Companies C through H: Tenents in a building have been offered a
&gt; larger bandwidth internet connection (with some 'pay by the MB
&gt; billing' arrangment).  Each tenent is linked back to the ISP via a
&gt; virtual path on a shared connection, so that any traffic between them
&gt; goes over the link twice.
&gt; [It is desired to set each company be set up with a
&gt; firewall/router/cache so that they can connect to a local peer network
&gt; and reduce some of the network traffic/cost, as well as make use of
&gt; local mirrors, IP telephony etc.]
&gt;
&gt;   Richard&gt; Hope you enjoyed my flight of fancy... :)
&gt;
&gt; I think it would be great to do.  It would be better to have some form
&gt; of company/agency supporting this work as well.  In the above cases,
&gt; part of my hessitation is that I might not be able to support the
&gt; installations, and even though Linux expertise is out there, the
&gt; people that I would be supplying don't know that.
