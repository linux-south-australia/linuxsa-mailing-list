&gt;&gt; There is also chattr +S; while the man page says this applies to files,
&gt;&gt; I have seen documentation that says it works with directories as well.

&gt; I doubt it.  That is, I doubt setting +S on a directory would have any
&gt; affect on files "within" that directory.  Remember that files are uniquely
&gt; identified by their inode number, not by any name, and files can (and
&gt; regularly do) appear in multiple directories simultaneously.

The last time I devoted serious amounts of thought about this
(without resorting to the kernel sources), I concluded it was
the same effect as the setuid bits on a directory; upon creation
of the file the file inherits "some" attributes from the directory.
So this time, I actually checked it ...

[<A HREF="mailto:root@nipnyep">root@nipnyep</A> /tmp]# mkdir /tmp/foo
[<A HREF="mailto:root@nipnyep">root@nipnyep</A> /tmp]# chattr +S foo
[<A HREF="mailto:root@nipnyep">root@nipnyep</A> /tmp]# lsattr -d foo
---S---- foo
[<A HREF="mailto:root@nipnyep">root@nipnyep</A> /tmp]# touch foo/bar
[<A HREF="mailto:root@nipnyep">root@nipnyep</A> /tmp]# lsattr foo/bar 
---S---- foo/bar

So that does appears to be the case.  My fault for being vague
originally (the original document that I refered to actually
recommended doing this to /var/spool/mqueue).

&gt; Files can even appear in *no* directory.  (Try this: bash$ exec 5&gt;foo
&gt; 6&lt;foo; ls -l / &gt;&5; ls -l foo; rm foo; cat &lt;&6)

Heh, File Systems 101 - it's one of the first things I try to teach
Unix Admin wannabees (usually after they've asked "why can't I free
up disk space when I've deleted this logfile?").  It would probably
make for a good job interview question for a Unix Admin position.

&gt; I suppose when the kernel opens a file it could look back through the
&gt; directory hierarchy, checking for +S in any of the outer directories, and
&gt; associate that with the open file descriptor.  It doesn't seem likely,
&gt; though.

You're right, it's not.

  Daryl Tester
