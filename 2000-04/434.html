Hi all.

I have been noticing a few problems with my PPP link lately. Namely,
when I connect I get an email from my ISP's server to the following 
effect:

&gt; This is to let you know that at the time this email was sent to you, 
&gt; you were using the SLIP server with an incorrect IP address of 
&gt; 192.168.1.1 instead of the 203.56.205.22 IP address that was issued to
&gt; you when the SLIP server started.

It would seem that the PPP system (at my end) is attempting to
use the IP address assigned to ETH0 (my internal network).

This problem does not happen all the time, however.  It seems to 
happen about half of the time.  My ISP implements a kind of
"redirection" service to work around the problem so I can still
access web sites, but things like FTP and RealAudio fail dismally.

Does anyone out there know of this problem, and/or know of the
solution to it.

I configured PPP using the netcfg tool with RedHat 6.0, and currently
use '/sbin/ifup ppp0' to bring it up.  This is called from my 
masqdial server, but the log shows that this is the command that was
called.

Thanks in advance,
Adam
