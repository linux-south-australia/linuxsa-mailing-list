Hi Rick

I havent tried the ppp solution yet so cant let u know if it worked or not,
my suspicion is that it will as its so simple ;-)

As far as USB & Linux, I've had great success with my Roadster, tho it did involve
sending it back to Netcomm for a USB firmware upgrade, they say theyre doing
it for Win2k compatibility, but in reality its just to update the USB firmware
to industry standards.  As for other USB devices, I'm not sure, tho if anyone
else has had success, put it on the list :-)

Go to <A HREF="http://www.linux-usb.org">http://www.linux-usb.org</A> for all the info, check out the working devices
link, and also the USB backport link.  This will give you the 2.3.50 kernel
usb drivers for your 2.2.14 kernel.  I had no problems patching & recompiling
my kernel.  Incidentally I'm running on RH 6.1, tho being kernel code it wont
matter which distribution you're using.  The backport code is on SUSE's site.

Regards

&gt;G'day Pete,
&gt;
&gt;    Try going to your /etc/ppp/options file with a good text editor and adding
the word
&gt;"noauth" without the inverted commas to the file.  Save it and you should be
away.  What
&gt;is happening is that your handshaking procedure (PAP) demands that the remote
system
&gt;identify itself, which at many Australian sites, it refuses to do.  Some sites
will have
&gt;secrets, but they are few and far between and usually private.  If you want
to know more
&gt;about secrets, the best elementary book I have seen is:Red Hat linux Bible
by Christopher
&gt;Negus, published by IDG.  Also see man pppd.
&gt;
&gt;    In return I am interested in USB.  How well is it supported by Linux and
what kernel
&gt;version are you using.  I was under the impression support was still in the
pipeline.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,   Rick

&gt;&gt; Hi all
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now that I've been using my Roadster USB for a while I decided to play around

&gt;&gt; with mgetty-sendfax yesterday, with the result that pppd now refuses to startup.

&gt;&gt;  It just goes into an endless loop because it cant find a password (!!??)
 I'm
&gt;&gt; still working on it, but if anyone has any ideas it would be appreciated.

&gt;&gt; An abbreviated output from my messages logfile is below, showing the successful

&gt;&gt; output when it was working and the current output.
&gt;&gt; Thanks
