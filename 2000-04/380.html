Hi,


&gt; Firstly i would like to ask anyone about their recommended partition sizes,
&gt; I have finaly upgraded my p100 with 1.3 GB HD to a p3-550 with 20 GB HD. I'm
&gt; give 5GB to a win partition as their will be other users of the computer who
&gt; want to run win95 (plus there are a few games i still like to play :)). The
&gt; rest will be allocated to Linux with the partitions
&gt; /
&gt; /home
&gt; /usr/local
&gt; /tmp
&gt; 
&gt; does anyone have recommendation for sizes i should allocate to these
&gt; partitions considering i'm using the box as a gateway, programming tool and
&gt; general computing tool (ie web, word proc. etc). Are there any other
&gt; partitions i should consider?

I think a /var is generally worthwhile, then if syslogs or email suddenly
go wild, then / is generally OK. Depends upon usage of the box tho.
If you are talking redhat /usr/share is where mosty binaries go. Generally
you can make /usr its own partition.

You can then have...

/ 100MB
/usr min 2 GB
/tmp min 100 MB
/var min 100 MB

You could also look at separate partitions for /var/spool/mail, and sim
linking /var/spool/tmp to /tmp

&gt; I was thinking of having tmp quite large and using it as the main file
&gt; repository for all users. Is it possible to assign the /tmp partition to a
&gt; vfat partition so that it is also accessible when i'm in windows?

Its probably better to give a separate partition for file exchange between
win and linux, it can be your shared file structure, but don't use /tmp as
you can't rely on files staying there, system processes can whipe it.

The only reason not to use vfat anywhere particularly is that it can't
handle file securities. Don't use it therefore for any system partition,
including /home.

Hope this helps.

cya
