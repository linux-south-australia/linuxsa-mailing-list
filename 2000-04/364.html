 &gt; This seems to happen a few times a day.
 &gt; A browser accessing a web page sends out some UDP packets
 &gt; to port 137 (netbios-ns).
 &gt; But that's supposed to be a LAN protocol, isn't it?
 &gt; (I don't know much about proprietary protocols.)

It's the WINS nameserver.  Some clients have WINS enabled for DNS 
resolution;  they'll send out a packet to ask your system what its
name is before they try the DNS.

 &gt; This kind of thing seems like what the MS mob would do to
 &gt; "differentiate their product in the market place" -- i.e. to
 &gt; undermine open standards.

Pah.  Block it like the rest of the world does and let it die :-)

 &gt; Question 2:
 &gt; Why do some browsers try to read the file "favicon.ico" in
 &gt; the browsed directory and the / directory?
 &gt; People keep on doing this to my web servers.
 &gt; But when I try to read <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico">http://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico</A>

When an IE user adds your page to their Favorites menu, their browser
tries to suck favicon.ico for the image for the icon that'll show up
next to your website name on the menu.  Be flattered that people are
bookmarking your site.

 &gt; PS.  In case you knew even less about PC power supplies
 &gt; than me, one should never get one of these modern-fangled
 &gt; ATX power supplies for computers that run linux and are
 &gt; supposed to come back up after a power failure (such as we
 &gt; are accustomed to in the third world [e.g. Adelaide]).
 &gt; I bought a whiz-bang modern little unit, only to find that
 &gt; I had to go back to an office personally to re-boot the machine
 &gt; after a power break (24 hours after I installed on OS on it -
 &gt; namely SuSE 6.2). Obviously I couldn't rely on being able to
 &gt; log in to such a machine from overseas.

There's a BIOS option you've neglected to look for which will make
it automatically power-on after an outage.  If it doesn't work for
you, blame either your BIOS or a crap brand of power supply;  there's
nothing inherently wrong with ATX power supplies.

 &gt; I reckon these ATX power supplies are clearly not intended for
 &gt; use in servers.

Those ATX power supplies are more or less the only type available for
servers these days.  Deal.
