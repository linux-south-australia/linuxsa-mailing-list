Perhaps the best way to think of name servers is the following,
especialy for non-computer people:

white pages	&lt;-&gt;	DNS

yellow pages	&lt;-&gt;	search engines

Everybody has a name/address, and the also have
a phone number (well, if they have a phone, that is).

You can either write down someone's phone number, or
look it up in the phone book every time you need it.
That's what DNS is -- and it allows people to change
their phone number as still be found.

What could be simpler?

Cheers,

PS.  Please direct all flames to me directly -
the one's that are directed against me, that is.

PPS. On the subject of DNS, every time I need to
identify an IP address, the DNS reverse lookup
very often fails, especially for Korea and China.
Then I used to look up:

<A HREF="http://ipindex.dragonstar.net/">http://ipindex.dragonstar.net/</A>

......hello, hello.
I was just about to say that it had disappeared without
trace for the last couple of months, but it's just
reappeared. Hallelujah. Now I can do _real_ reverse
address translation again.

Eh bien, viola [sic]! They have a new official site at

<A HREF="http://www.ipindex.net/">http://www.ipindex.net/</A>

This is the place to look when you think you're under attack
from Korea and China.
(By the way, probably most of those attacks from there are
by US kids who have broken into lightly guarded machines.
And the webmasters almost never reply!)
