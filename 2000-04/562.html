&gt; This is not an advertorial for the site, it is doing very nicely thank
&gt; you &lt;grin&gt;. Some people would consider any 'updates' posting as junk
&gt; mail and innapropriate. Please let me know *publicly* if a posting to
&gt; this mailgroup would be appreciated.

This is old, but I only just read it... (damn mail filters screw up
sometimes, i think I need a step-by-step guide to filtering)

If this discussion has not already been had:

Posting the updates to your site is generally considered junk mail.
I haven't had the time to visit your site yet, so I cannot comment
on the value of the information there.

This is, however, a group that aims to help beginners, and even those
who are more experienced but run into bother sometimes. Therefore,
I think that regular updates about what is available may be 
appreciated by many members.

I have seen the format of these "updates", and I don't particularly
care for it.  I would personally prefer a digest format, where all
the updates for the week/fortnight/month are listed in one hit.  This way,
I receive less emails in my inbox to wade through.  I also think that
you should find a prefix for the subject line (SBS?) that will allow
users to easily filter the mail if they want to save it elsewhere,
or to ignore it (if they choose).  You might also find it better to
post a list of all "step-by-steps" available at your site to enable
users to decide if they wish to visit (how many are actually there?),
rather than the users having to visit to find what is there.

What may actually be in order is a regular update list of a number of
popular Linux related sites, particularly the kernel, and XFree sites.

This is just my $0.02 worth.  

Cheers,
Adam
