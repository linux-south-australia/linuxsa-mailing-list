Just been given an old laptop (thanks Shaun) and I need to put a 
version of Linux on it.

It is a Packard Bell Statesman plus. I think it is in the 200C series 
model 810415. It has 7.4 M of ram (I think one of the chips is U/S), a 
Cyrix 486 CPU and a Seagate 200 M hard drive. It has a floppy drive, 16 
bit PCMCIA slot plus connectors for PS2, LPT, 15 pin VGA (outputs to 
the CTR in colour - neat) and 9 pin COM port.

Firstly I need to get it on the network so I can store the current OS 
images in case I need to recover them one day. Then find a way to 
install a distro of some kind.

I was thinking of Morphix or something like that which has been 
optimised for the low-spec machine. With such low ram (and max has been 
fitted) chances are that most downloadable packages will be too much 
for installing on this little beast.

I have discussed this with several at LCA including some of the greats. 
No wonder Linus signed it with "Good Luck" and Bdale signed it with a 
Debian symbol suggesting that it was probably the only thing from 
Debian I would be able to get on it. Somebody has a photo of the 
signing ceremony, would love a copy of it please.

Any suggestions on which distro and how to install it?

BTW, I have the Xircom PE3 Printer port to Ethernet adapter if that 
gives somebody ideas on how to do the extraction and install.
I cant get it to work under the version of WFW3.11 that is still on the 
machine (but not for too long).
 Cheers,
 Ian
