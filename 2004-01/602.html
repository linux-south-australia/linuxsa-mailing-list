&gt; Even though Im no expert on this I really think BPA have a right to sell a

&gt; are saying heres the deal 100 years+first born and this modem for 1000/month
&gt; take it or leave it.

Exactly. I don't understand why people bother complaining about this
kind of jazz. Really, I don't. If punters don't like what Peter the Shoe
Peddler's selling, then said punter goes elsewhere. Is it that hard to
fathom?

Seeing as the product isn't exactly the bees knees anyhow, why, but why,
would *ANYONE* waste valuable heartbeats arguing the point? If they want
to sell an overpriced product, let 'em.

&gt; And whilst it sounds silly they are not obliged to sell you anything if they
&gt; dont want.

Or, conversely and more importantly, Joe Punter isn't obliged to by
anything from anyone. 'Round here, if I don't like the shoes, I bugger
off and find me a better peddler

&gt; btw : take it easy on the flames plz

Heh :-) Nothing to flame about here. I'm more frazzled by the fact that
we're here writing installments to Telstra's Legal Position in Relation
to Bundling ADSL Modems (coming to a cinema near you) at half-passed
twelve on a Friday night.

I wonder what the average fitness level of LinuxSA'ers is. I wonder when
the last time aforementioned Mr Average went for a run, played a game of
footy or just got out of there chair and away from their monitor.

Christ! *WHO* the hell starts these threads?!

      that shits me to tears. ]
