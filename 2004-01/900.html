&gt;
&gt; Lets dwell on that point, Steve.

This is getting very repetitive. I've already answered most of these 
points.

The difficulty seems to be that you're so wrapped up in your 
perspective that you're responding in a pointillist fashion. When the 
arguments are holistic, they're guaranteed to sail through each other 
like two galaxies colliding. Maybe one or two points will impact to no 
overall effect.

I see you're questioning my background and abilities, so you're getting 
personal. All I will say is that you're in no position whatsoever to 
question my credentials and proven work history.

&gt; All security measures, regardless of whether they're implemented by
&gt; people, technology, or steel walls and doors, have one thing in
&gt; common:  They aim to adjust the cost/benefit analysis of whatever
&gt; attack they're trying to defend against.

Quoting reams of basic security information doesn't demonstrate any 
intelligence in your arguments, only the defective nature of their 
conclusions. You have the first few steps right, but it's the ending 
that determines the success of the mission.

You started this with the following:

&gt; Every argument I've ever seen to support unwanted "doorknocking" is
&gt; intellectually and morally bankrupt.

I will finish it with:

Doorknocking is essential to prove that security really is there, 
otherwise there could be holes that can be exploited anytime. It's not 
about your laptop, it's about the State Government or corporations not 
providing due diligence for sensitive data.

Now point your armchair expertise in another direction and we'll call 
it quits.
