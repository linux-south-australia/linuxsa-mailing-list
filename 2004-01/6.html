Hi,

Romana, David, 

Happy new year,

&gt; nonetheless, for many of us, its just part of the
&gt; budget that won't
&gt; stretch. 

Why advertise that fact on this list. If you can't go,
you can't go, get over it :-| 

&gt; i just wish it was possible that such events could
&gt; be more open to the
&gt; greater, struggling, coalface type community - to
&gt; whom even 99 dollars
&gt; is a hefty whack. i know too many people on austudy
&gt; who would prefer to 
&gt; eat, for example....

It's supply and demand, simple economics :-|
If prices were $10 you couldn't hold a conference like
this, there would be too much interest. If you play
your cards right the money invested could show a
profitable return. Networking. If you want it, go get
it!

&gt; certainly, the organisers have all been happy to
help
&gt; computerbank/itshare sa whenever they could. they
&gt; are community aware.
&gt; but shaun, as coordinator of computerbank/itshare,
&gt; is certainly even
&gt; more aware of the disparity issue. its the raison
&gt; d'etre of what we do.
&gt; scarcely a sob story, no? a sob story would be
&gt; whinging WITHOUT doing
&gt; anything.

With all respect, this isn't about
computerbank/itshare. 

David,

&gt; I've been broke and poor before
&gt; and I know what an extra
&gt; 50 cents can mean. It can mean the difference
&gt; between eating or not.

&lt;sob&gt;&lt;sob&gt;&lt;snivel&gt;&lt;blubber&gt;

&gt; I know; I think I may have worked out a constructive
&gt; way to help Shaun get
&gt; to some parts of the conference.

That's positive, well done,

man sieht sich,

Gazza
