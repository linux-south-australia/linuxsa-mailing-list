&gt; You know what I bet this is... a hoax....
You know... I think you're right.  But it might as well have been the =
real
thing for all the panic it put me through!!!  The morale of this story =
(for
me) is that one should never try to do what one is unqualified to do...

Anyone have any suggestions on where I can go (relativly inexpensivly) =
to
learn the basics of routing/firewalling so that I can not go into a =
'tizzy'
if something like this happens again?


&gt; it isn't a trojan at all, the zip file probably contains
&gt; something akin to a html file or something similar
&gt; with an IFRAME which is set to point to
&gt; %USERHOME (or whatever the variable
&gt;  is)%/Desktop/ which thus shows your
&gt; desktop.
I think you're right seeing as I can't find any of the footprints that =
are
supposed to be associated with Trojans and etc.  (Talk about =
embarrasing)

On a side note; I'm really glad that I didn't mention that LinuxSA
subscriber's name now that sent me the file either. (Discretion really =
is
the better part of valour it turns out)

Anyway...  Thanks for everyone's help - but I meant what I wrote above =
about
learning to do this properly; so would really appreciate it if someone =
could
point me into the right direction?
