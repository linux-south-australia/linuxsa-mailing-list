&gt; But the assumption that James makes, actually I think he infered it,
&gt; is evident from his comment that, "[Windows users'] have to be told
&gt; why Linux is better (and it really has to be better for them), not
&gt; just why Windows is trash."  For those that missed it, the assumption
&gt; is that we want people to convert from Windows to unix.  I disagree. 
&gt; I don't want them to.  I don't care if they do, in fact I'm almost
&gt; filled with apathy at the notion.  Let them come if they want to, but
&gt; let us not make ourselves into the image of our enemy just to seduce
&gt; our enemies supporters into switching camps.

HELP!  I'm agreeing with David Newall again!  
I just can't help it ... &lt;sob&gt;

IMHO David has this just about absolutely right.  There is a huge 
difference between intelligent advocacy (see OSS in Govt - LCA2004) and 
beligerant preaching.
What we ARE campaigning for is FREEDOM, which is exactly what M$ is 
trying to deny.  Unless M$ succeeds in subverting the Internet - and 
don't think they aren't trying - the march to unix is unstoppable.

That laptop-DVD example?  Plain ignorance.  Many hardware manufacturers 
lazily use parts of the M$ system to save themselves money (eg 
WinModems).  Laptops are no exception (Toshiba is an example).  OF 
COURSE there will be those laptops which have features which are 
Windoze-specific.  That's what we complain about.
