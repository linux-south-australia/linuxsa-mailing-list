If that were the case, we could definitely agree that Micro$hizenhou$sen as
a collective had lost their minds.

Still, it's a point well made. My solution is to trust nobody's opinion
until I'd tried it myself. :-) That isn't easy with a $700 purchse I guess
which is why I reckon there should be some sort of eval version of Windows
available for download. Mind you, they wouldn't sell many of the full
versions if people could try before they bought. :-)

Jonathan,

&gt; If I was to buy a new 4wd from Toyota, i'd be pretty cynical of any 
&gt; "Toyota-sponsored.." reports saying Toyota 4wd's were best..

However, a discerning customer would not immediately discredit them either.
Discrediting a report from Toyota about Toyota or Company X by Company X
with no basis in fact is practising exactly what we all seem to agree is a
bad practice.

It's not quite so easy; let me turn this on its head: would we agree with
Microsoft if a study it conducted using its own researchers were to conclude
that open source software run using the Linux operating system gave a lower
total cost of ownership?
