I happen to know Darren as well, having worked with him a few
years ago.

I'm quite surprised he did this. You never "test" out security
without legal and written permission from the people you are
targetting. This is common security consultant practice. You need
to get written and legal permission so they don't drag you to
court, even if they verbally asked you to do it.

Further more, penetration testing isn't all that valuable. It
doesn't prove security as a whole, it only proves or disproves
security for the techniques the penetration tester used. You have
no assurance that you are secure from techniques not tested.

For those who think what he did was ok, let me propose a
scenario.

Lets say you get home from the movies, your house appears to be
secure, but you find a note from me, inside your fridge, saying,
"Just to let you know, I broke into your house while you were
away. Don't worry, I didn't steal anything."

Do you 

(a) ring the police, and say your house was broken in to ?

or 

(b) say to yourself, "gee, I'm really greatful somebody broke
into my house. Now I know I need to do something about my
security."

Now, say I did break into your house, but didn't leave a note,
such that you didn't know I'd broken in. Would you be happy about
me knowing how to break into your house without your detecting it
? Probably not.

Let's say your neighbour saw me break in one day, and called the
cops, and they catch me. Would you press charges if I said "sure,
I broke in, but I didn't steal anything, so what are you worried
about ?" I would think you would.

Well, Darren did the same thing, and they pressed charges.

Regards,
Mark.
