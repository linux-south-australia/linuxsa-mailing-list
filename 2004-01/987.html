&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; 
&gt; I've managed to get mutt signing keys etc. and I was wondering 
&gt; what the recommendations about what the default behaviour should be;
&gt; should I pgp sign all my outgoing messages by default?
&gt; If not, why not? Or if yes, why?

I sign everything. I have had my email address forged in the From fields of
spam - some of the spammers have even been thick enough to send such
forgeries to me! - and I like to establish the precedent that everything I
send is signed. Anything that isn't signed didn't come from me. This isn't
exactly as positive as I'd like, but it seems to be the best one can do.

&gt; Some OE using folks seem to have complained bitterly about 
&gt; PGP signed messages, are there enough folks on this list
&gt; using OE to worry about that?

I tell 'em it's their fault for using a broken mail client. Sometimes I go
on to point them at Karsten M. Self's "rant" on the subject, at
&lt;<A HREF="http://kmself.home.netcom.com/Rants/gpg-signed-mail.html&gt">http://kmself.home.netcom.com/Rants/gpg-signed-mail.html&gt</A>;. This is his
thoughts, not mine, but I agree with 99% of it.

You can "set pgp create traditional=yes" (and depending on your version of
mutt, "set pgp outlook compat=yes"  as well ) if the sub-optimal solution of
"meeting brokenness with brokenness" is forced upon you. The first of these
causes mutt to "inline-sign" messages, and the second causes it to set the
Content-Type: header to "text/plain". AIUI later versions of mutt don't have
a separate "pgp outlook compat", and just use "text/plain" for inline signed
messages anyway.
