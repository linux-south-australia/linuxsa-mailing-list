&gt; That's complete bullshit, Steve.
&gt;
&gt; Why is it that the field of computer trespass has so many defenders?
&gt; You never hear people passionately arguing for the right for meatspace
&gt; trespassers to carry on doing whatever it is they want to do, yet for
&gt; some reason when computers are involved all our social norms and
&gt; expectations go out the window.


I think that the reason why there may be such a vigourous defence of 
computer trepass is due to inequities in the past. Kevin Mitnick era 
computer trespassers were demonized by the media and Governments and 
were prosecuted under quite .. imaginative(?) charges..

In light of the over-reaction by Governments at this time, a large 
section of the computer community had/has jumped to the defence of 
computer criminals..

Arguably, times have change a lot since the early 90's (where the laws 
on computer crime had yet to be determined*) and I agree with Mark 
Newton that it is now quite plain what is criminal and what is not.

I don't think that the argument of 'they had poor security and i just 
wanted to show them that' is valid any more..

*Remembering that up until the late 1980's many systems were quite 
freely open - networks were built on trust in academia.
  The idea of electronic 'theft' was still being solidified, prior to 
the 1980's theft usually required some sort of deprivation of use, this 
is clearly not the case with software.
