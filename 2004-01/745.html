I know that my house can be broken into, therefore Scenario A gives me 
no additional information.

I don't know that my computer can be broken into, therefore Scenario B 
would be appreciated if the hacker informed me of the problem before 
someone really went to town on my data.

In addition to that analogy that only captures a very limited spectrum 
of the overall problem, consider the Wizard of Oz...

The mighty mighty Wizard of Security that protects an entire realm of 
people and goods and data and money, unless you poke under the curtain. 
It is against the law to look under the curtain! And the mighty mighty 
Wizard of Security ruled over his realm for many decades... until 
someone poked and the whole edifice came tumbling down!

Should Dorothy be punished? Or should things have been done right in 
the first place so there really was a Wizard of Security with actual 
security?

And if there's a Wizard of Security with actual real security, why 
would the curtain be needed?

Just call me AnalogyBoy! I'll wear my underpants on the outside. :)
