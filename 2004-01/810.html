&gt; It means that I should be able to tell you about the bug in your

&gt; was unzipped meant I could be prosecuted for perving at your willy!

If I've taken steps to ensure that my willy isn't visible, and you
yank down my zipper then tell me that my dick is exposed, I'll press
charges.

What we're talking about isn't passive, Steve.  We're talking about
what to do with people who make conscious decisions to perform
criminal acts.

You may decide that you'd appreciate it if it was your network,
but you need to accept that other people make different value
judgements about that issue.

For all your denigration of my reliance on law, what else should
I rely on?  We've already established that there's no method
whatsoever I can use to keep people who really want to from
trespassing on my property;  Even disconnecting from the network
isn't protection from social engineers who want to helpfully point
out flaws in my security, is it?

It seems to me that without laws, the only way I can prevent
unauthorized access of my property is by NOT OWNING ANY PROPERTY.
What a bizarre outcome.

&gt; For that matter, how was the bug discovered? Only by someone trying to 
&gt; break the security on the broken firewall!


But how was it exploited?  By someone who knew they wouldn't be welcome
attacking it.

Look, it isn't like there aren't other ways to demonstrate to someone
that their security is poor.  We've evolved a long way from the
primates, where the only way to teach something to someone else was
by way of demonstration.  If you want to tell me that my network
security is bad, bloody well TELL me.

In the unlikely theoretical case where I don't listen, you STILL
don't have the right to give me proof by demonstration.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm advocating that much of the information that may be kept on the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; police network should NOT be plugged into the Internet.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Why is the Internet so special?
&gt; 
&gt; Because it's really really public

It's not "really really public";  It's just used by lots of people.

Just like Australia is, really.  Macroscopically it looks like
an enormous public space, but when you zoom in you find that it's
made up out of public spaces and countless billions of private spaces.


&gt; Do you have any objections to the police keeping your private 
&gt; information on a public webserver? What about on a public machine with 
&gt; ROT-13 encryption? Where is the line drawn, and why are you drawing a 
&gt; line when you're arguing that the law provides the protection you want?

I think the line is drawn when the police, showing all due diligence,
take reasonable steps to protect the information.  Steps which are
proportional to the sensitivity of the data.  Some police data would
be on their public website (contact details, press releases, etc).
Some would be behind a firewall.  Some would be behind multiple
firewalls fed by encrypted network links.  That's all fine;  I don't
accept that there is data which the police (or anyone else) shouldn't
ever keep on any computer anywhere because someone might potentially
gain unauthorized access to it.

But lets not talk about data;  it's too abstract.  What about my
physical computer?  It's real property;  it'll hurt if you drop it
on your foot.  You argue that I shouldn't get to decide how it's
used, and that if I discover that it has been used in a way I didn't
approve that I shouldn't use the law to seek redress.  Why not?

Quite aside from whether it's likely that I'll catch someone who
breaches my security, if I do know who it is and can catch them, why
shouldn't I press charges and have them put in jail?

&gt;&gt; You reckon that the only way I can have any expectation of privacy
&gt;&gt; is to disconnect myself from the network.  Is the telephone network
&gt;&gt; included in that?  How about the road network...?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. You can choose which bits of information to connect and 
&gt; which bits to disconnect.

No I can't, Steve.  Social engineering means my privacy isn't even safe
if I disconnect from networks altogether.

Your argument is absurd.  It reduces to the elimination of all private
property as a defense against the fear that said property will be
misused.

Normal people don't react that way to the threat of a security breach.
Normal people assess the situation and decide upon a risk profile
they're comfortable with.  The assessment of the situation necessarily
includes the fact that the countermeasures for some attacks include
jail time.

&gt; You have a touching faith in the law, completely missing a number of 
&gt; important points that invalidate your perspective:
&gt; 
&gt;     1) The law can only be applied to people who are caught.

ANY law can only be applied to people who are caught.  If you're
going to defend electronic door-knocking in that way, you'll also
have to defend murder by the same argument.

Since when was an act legitimate simply because it could be
performed anonymously?

&gt;     2) The law in one country is different from the law in another country.

You'll find that the law is remarkably consistent from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction when you consider the subject
matter we're discussing here.

&gt;     3) There are people who don't care about the law.

Yup - And, when they're caught, they're put in jail.  Do you have a
problem with that?

&gt;     4) There's probably a law against flying planes into buildings.

An aircraft in flight must maintain at least 500' clearance from
ground except when taking off and landing, and 50' clearance from
obstacles.

Lets loiter on this point a bit, though:  If someone who flew a plane
into a building happened to survive (like the guy who flew a cessna
into a govt building in Florida a couple of years ago), should that
person be prosecuted?

Nobody is arguing that having a law against something stops that
thing from happening.  That'd be a stupid line of reasoning.  Having
a law means that if something happens in breach of the law, the
consequences are larger than they would be if the law didn't exist.

Anyone can do anything they want -- As long as they're prepared to
put up with the consequences.  Sometimes the consequences are
nil (when an act is legal), sometimes they're benign (when an act
is illegal but the person isn't caught, or is handled leniently
by the courts), sometimes they're serious (you're in the pokey!)
and sometimes they're unintended (you're in the pokey with Bubba,
and that 3 month sentance you picked up for violating Section 44
of the South Australian Summary Offences Act is actually going to
result in your death because you now have AIDS).

There are consequences.  The law stacks the consequences in favour
of those who don't violate it.  I don't pretend that Section 44
of the Summary Offences Act magically renders my computer system
secure, or that my private data is magically protected on third-party
computer systems.  But that doesn't matter;  The law is there so that
someone who is engaged in the conscious decisionmaking process
leading up to the commission of a criminal act will have a weightier
idea of the consequences of that act than they'd have if the law
didn't exist.

&gt; Your faith in the law protects you against one, and only one group, of 
&gt; people... those who get caught. It's a very small group when considered 
&gt; against the wider world, and against people who don't care if they get 
&gt; caught (eg, people who fly planes into buildings).


Yet society sticks together, and is largely law abiding.  Why is that,
Steve?

Now that it has been conclusively proven that it's possible to
carry out a terrorist act against the USA, why is it that absolutely
no terrorist acts have been carried out on US soil since Sept 11 2001?

Could it be because normal people don't break laws?  Bloody hell, normal 
people don't even THINK about laws, but they manage to follow them
anyway.

Could it be that the four points you've raised above are only
factors considered by a small minority of people, and that
therefore the threat of
terrorism/break-and-enter/theft/computer-misuse/kiddyporn/murder
is actually incredibly low?

How much should I permit that incredibly low threat to affect my
life?  As I make decisions throughout my life, should I say things
like, "I'm going to refuse to own a computer because if I did own
one there's a small chance that someone could socially-engineer
themselves into it and steal all my personal data"?

&gt; In a war, all the laws are out of the window except for the Rules of 
&gt; Engagement 

We're not at war, Steve.  We're just living in a world where we
have to tolerate a small number of criminals.

Nobody who breaks into my computer is a freedom fighter or a
soldier.  They're a criminal;  and they'll be treated as such.
