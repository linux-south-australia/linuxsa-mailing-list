&gt; I don't think that's what Ryan's asking for.  If he was wanting

&gt; professional if that's what he was looking for :-).
&gt; 
&gt; With due respect to the other comments on this thread about LCA not
&gt; being cheap at $275, firewire cameras are (relatively) cheap consumer
&gt; items these days (&lt;$1k).  I presume these "cheap" ones don't count as
&gt; the sort of equipment that a "qualified broadcast standard operator"
&gt; would be using.
&gt; 
&gt; I think Ryan was hoping to reach people who:
&gt; - would be coming (or would like to come) to LCA anyway
&gt; - wouldn't mind paying less than what they would otherwise pay to
&gt;   attend the conference
&gt; - happen to own a firewire camera
&gt; - wouldn't mind pointing that camera at a speaker for a few hours each
&gt;   day

Exactly.  I'm not asking for qualified broadcast standard operators, I'm
looking for geeks that have their own cameras, and wouldn't mind
pointing their camera at things a few hours a day (and then dumping
their stuff onto a G5 via firewire at the end of the day) :-)

Great way to get a discounted registration if you ask me.  I need to
write up a proper announcement, which you'll probably see later today.

This is a volunteer ran event, remember.
