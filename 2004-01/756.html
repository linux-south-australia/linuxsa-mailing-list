Hi.

Hang on a minute. Aren't you BOTH right?

Mark is reading from the 'Law of the Land'. I'm sure He's right.

Stephen is reading from 'Practical Network Security' 

The thing about a gate on the house is that you can tell if it's strong by looking
at it from a distance. No-one can tell if you looked at it from a security angle
when you walked by, and it isn't illegal to walk by and look at the gate, is it?

On a network, everything can be recorded, including any sort of casual 'looking'
at your 'front gate'. Hundreds of people 'push' on your network 'front gate' every
day. Wouldn't that be called 'Attempted Break-in' in the law book? How come we
only get excited about the people who push on the weak part of the gate?

Which part of 'looking' is going to be called 'pushing' Can we have someone
charged for it, even if our defenses are adequate?

Another muddy 2c thrown in :)

&gt; &gt;The mighty mighty Wizard of Security that protects an entire realm of 
&gt; &gt;people and goods and data and money, unless you poke under the curtain. 
&gt; &gt;It is against the law to look under the curtain! 
&gt; 
&gt; Isn't that what the law is for?  Isn't the law of trespass an
&gt; acknowledgement that security isn't perfect, that private individuals
&gt; can't prevent other individuals from trespassing if the trespassers
&gt; are determined enough, and that therefore the law exists to use the
&gt; power of the state to punish those who don't take the hint from
&gt; property owners...?
&gt; 
&gt; Do you believe the laws of trespass on private property should be
&gt; abolished to make them consistent with your view of network security?
&gt; 
&gt; I can't stop you from breaking into my house.  If I build a steel
&gt; door, you can use a gas-axe.  You can use explosives.  You can
&gt; rip security mesh off its hinges.  You can use an angle grinder to
&gt; cut through bars I might put on my windows.  You have all sorts of
&gt; options, because physical security isn't perfect.
&gt; 
&gt; So we have laws:  If you take advantage of the fact that physical
&gt; security isn't perfect, and go somewhere where you aren't supposed
&gt; to go, expect to end up in jail.
&gt; 
&gt; Replace the word "physical" with "network" in the paragraph above
&gt; and the rule still holds.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't care whether my network security is 100% bulletproof;  I choose
&gt; to connect to networks.  I shouldn't have to isolate myself from the
&gt; electronic world to stop trespassers, any more than I should need to
&gt; isolate myself from the physical world to protect my physical property.
&gt; 
&gt; Stupid argument.  It's already been, gone, and been settled.  Why are
&gt; we having this discussion?
