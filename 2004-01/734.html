I agree with the thought that security should be adequately tested but I'm a
little uncomfortable with the possibility that someone could gain my
personal details such as my address. For the 99% of crackers not interested
in the personal details of a bank's customers, there is a small group who
would find them very interesting, not to mention useful and by extension,
potentially profitable.

That said, I also vehemently disagree with this line of reasoning:

&gt; When you're plugged into the network, it's the same as being in a 
&gt; public place. People should be free to explore what is in public

My employers (SA Police) are plugged into a network. Surely you're not
advocating that information contained therein is for public consumption. I'd
be very uncomfortable with the possibility that a cracker could see the
subjects of my investigations, are related to or know one or more and decide
to warn them that they're being looked at. And then there's the possibility
that offenders themselves would be smart enough to crack our network.
Unmitigated disaster comes readily to mind.

"No, no, I didn't look at the files showing that I'm being targeted by the
Child Exploitation Unit at all. I was just testing your security for your
own benefit."

Hmmmmmmmmmmm..................

Data is not property. Data is infinitely replicable, property isn't. 
This is the same misunderstanding that afflicts the RIAA and DMCA.

&gt; In the online world, people like you demand perfection.  Any chink
&gt; in our security armour is an invitation for an intruder, if one follows
&gt; your line of reasoning.  "Reasonable" efforts at security aren't
&gt; good enough;  the only way we can keep out "doorknockers" is by 
&gt; erecting
&gt; absolutely inpenetrable walls, and if we don't do that we're expected
&gt; to "understand" and protect the doorknockers from criminal sanctions.

The reasonable effort at security is to unplug your computer from the 
network. It's very easy and completely effective.

When you're plugged into the network, it's the same as being in a 
public place. People should be free to explore what is in public, and I 
certainly wouldn't be happy with trusting a bank that had not been 
thoroughly explored by a bevy of security experts AND amateurs.
