&gt;&gt; It seems to me that without laws, the only way I can prevent
&gt;&gt; unauthorized access of my property is by NOT OWNING ANY
&gt;&gt; PROPERTY.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Data is not property. Data is not property. Repeat as a mantra until it 
&gt; sinks in.

Steve:

Since we've started this conversation, I have consistently said, "I
don't care if data is property.  I'm talking about my physical computer,
and my ability to control how -that- property is used."

You keep muddying the waters with gunk about intellectual property.

I don't give a shit about intellectual property;  and I've made that
abundantly clear in every single message I've sent in this thread.
Whether or not data is property is completely irrelevent.

By continually dragging this into the debate, you're guilty of exactly
that which you accuse me of.  You're using the concept of
intellectual property to confuse and befuddle an otherwise
straightforward concept.

Let me ask you one simple question:

If I own a computer, should I have the right to approve or disapprove
of the actions of a third party which makes that computer do something
which I didn't want to happen?

If I disapprove, is it reasonable for me to have the ability to make
them stop?

If I can make them stop by having them locked away at Yatala in a place
which doesn't have any computers, is that an appropriate weapon in the
arsenal of countermeasures available to me to combat that threat?

You'll note that nothing in those paragraphs has anything to do with
intellectual property.  We would have been able to have had this
entire debate without once needing to think about whether data was
property if you didn't keep dragging it in.

So stop dragging it in, and answer the questions which form the
crux of this issue.  Should a property owner have the ability to
approve or disapprove of the uses to which his property is put?


&gt;&gt;&gt; For that matter, how was the bug discovered? Only by someone trying 
&gt;&gt;&gt; to break the security on the broken firewall!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But how was it exploited?  By someone who knew they wouldn't be welcome
&gt;&gt; attacking it. 
&gt; 
&gt; But how was it discovered? By the same means. Don't overlook the 
&gt; discovery phase or it's an invalid chain of reasoning.

It's only an invalid chain of reasoning if your view of human behaviour
is simplistic to the point of stupidity.

The exploitation of the bug requires the assailant to make a
conscious decision to perform actions which they know are illegal
and unwanted.  It also requires them to perform those actions even
though they know there are legal alternatives (like, for example,
ringing me up and telling me about the bug).

We've had this part of the conversation before;  Yet you still
appear to claim that these attackers are robots who have no alternative
but to exploit whatever bug they happen to find.  That's the script-
kiddy's defence, Steve.  Are you seriously proposing that it's ok?
That if a bug exists then I should accept that someone will be forced
to exploit it against their will?

&gt;&gt; I think the line is drawn when the police, showing all due diligence,
&gt;&gt; take reasonable steps to protect the information.  Steps which are
&gt;&gt; proportional to the sensitivity of the data.  Some police data would
&gt;&gt; be on their public website (contact details, press releases, etc).
&gt;&gt; Some would be behind a firewall.  Some would be behind multiple
&gt;&gt; firewalls fed by encrypted network links.
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly. So who is going to punish the State Government for _not_ having 
&gt; shown due diligence? Why is Darren Kruse being punished for having 
&gt; jiggled the door knob? How was anyone going to tell the State Government 
&gt; that they hadn't shown due diligence?

Darren Kruse is hardly being punished.  He has a good behaviour bond,
a suspended sentance, and no conviction recorded.  Gee, Steve, the judge
really threw the book at him, didn't he?  Whoa!

Darren Kruse had the ability (if not the duty, as an employee) to
notify responsible people about poor security as he found it.  Instead
he did something that was stupid and illegal.

I'm not going to defend him for doing that.  I know the guy;  I've had
drinks with him in pubs 'n' all that, but that doesn't mean that when
he does something stupid and illegal that I'll go, "Hey, that's ok.
Lets just let it happen."

&gt; On one hand you argue that due diligence is needed, then on the other 
&gt; hand you argue against any and all methods by which this due diligence 
&gt; can be proven!

We don't need "any and all" methods by which due diligence can be
proven.  We only need one method.  Any method which is legal will do,
I don't care.

You've said you would be happy for someone to demonstrate your own lax
security by breaking into your computer.  If they were offered the
alternative of emailing you about it, would you be happier about that?

Guess what?  -EVERYONE- has the alternative of sending an email message,
having a conversation, making a phone call.  All you need to do is
ask permission, then you can give proof by demonstration if you're
able.  Everything you think should be allowed is possible;  you need
only to ask first.

If you don't ask, you're wilfully and knowingly committing a crime,
and there are consequences.

  &gt;&gt;&gt; In a war, all the laws are out of the window except for the Rules of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Engagement
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We're not at war, Steve.  We're just living in a world where we
&gt;&gt; have to tolerate a small number of criminals.
&gt; 
&gt; I disagree with building weak infrastructure that can be blown away as 
&gt; soon as things get serious.

So do I.  But your alternative is to blow it all away when things
aren't serious.

And that's serious.

&gt; And when there is no way of testing and reporting problems, that closes 
&gt; off the only avenue for finding and fixing them.

You keep talking as if you believe that proof by demonstration carried
out by an unknown and untrusted third party is "the only avenue for
finding and fixing" security problems.

That's bizarre, Steve.  We're not primates.  We have language.  We
can talk to each other.  We can form agreements, we can teach, we can
learn.

This attitude of yours that says breaking into computers is "the only
way" is simply not backed up by anything realistic.

Anyway;  It's too late.  What you're advocating is already illegal.
It has been since the late 80's.  Advocate it all you like, it won't
make any difference.

&gt; In summary, I think this exchange shows the situation is more 
&gt; complicated than "private property, keep off!".

Only because people like you, when confronted with a sign which says
"private property, keep off!" insist that "No!" is an acceptable
response!
