&gt;same story here
&gt;
&gt;&gt; What a shambles that event made of that part of the city.
&gt;
&gt;the event organisers just seem to ignore parking these days,
&gt;and there is just not enough parking in the city after 6pm...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The presentation was interesting (same as what was given by Anand at 
&gt;&gt; LCA).
&gt;
&gt;I think the best thing that came out of the talk,
&gt;was that the installer will be simpler without
&gt;losing any of its usfulness.
&gt;
&gt;So if you have anything thats a little to tricky for
&gt;the main install environment you can build a uDeb to
&gt;do the dirty work and present that clean interface to 
&gt;the user without having to compromise that clean shiny
&gt;text interface =)

The volume of mail is larger than this list (for e.g.)
