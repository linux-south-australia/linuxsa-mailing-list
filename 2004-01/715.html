That's complete bullshit, Steve.

Why is it that the field of computer trespass has so many defenders?
You never hear people passionately arguing for the right for meatspace
trespassers to carry on doing whatever it is they want to do, yet for
some reason when computers are involved all our social norms and
expectations go out the window.

Every argument I've ever seen to support unwanted "doorknocking" is
intellectually and morally bankrupt.

Why is it so hard to understand?  If I own a piece of property, I get
to decide who can lawfully access it -- That's what "owning" property
means.  Any access which I don't authorize is UNlawful access;  those
who unlawfully access my property should be prosecuted by the law.

We shouldn't have to go to the trouble of making it completely and
utterly impossible to unlawfully access property in order to prevent
people from trespassing.  We don't do it in the real world:  We "secure"
our houses with thin plywood veneer doors, easily smashed down.  We
have windows which can be broken by an attacker.  We have tiled roofs
which can be lifted up to serve as makeshift "doors" by people who
can't break down our doors or smash our windows.  This is all imperfect
security -- But it's a good-enough tradeoff for the real world, where
using those security systems is enough to tell the non-criminal
population that they can't enter without authorization, and anyone who
ignores those signs and enters anyway is prosecuted.  So why
shouldn't/don't the same rules apply online?

In the online world, people like you demand perfection.  Any chink
in our security armour is an invitation for an intruder, if one follows
your line of reasoning.  "Reasonable" efforts at security aren't
good enough;  the only way we can keep out "doorknockers" is by erecting
absolutely inpenetrable walls, and if we don't do that we're expected
to "understand" and protect the doorknockers from criminal sanctions.

I don't accept that any chink in our electronic armour counts as an
invitation to people who are "just looking".  I should be able to
send the message that unlawful access is unwanted by going to
*reasonable* amounts of trouble to secure my systems, just like I
can in the real world.  And if I take those reasonable steps and
people decide to trespass anyway, I see nothing wrong with using
criminal law against them and sending them to jail -- just like I
could in the real world.
