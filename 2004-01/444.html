&gt; So it's near the end of the first day of linux.conf.au's mini 
&gt; conference. There's a good vibe here - relaxed yet interesting. The 
&gt; conference packs are very well done, and I'm particularly impressed 
&gt; with Dan Shearer's instanta-demo CD. :)
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed something curious... nearly all the seminars I find 
&gt; interesting are South Australian speakers. Either we have a lot of 
&gt; them, or we're a very interesting bunch of people. :)
&gt; 
&gt; So far I've seen a couple of people I know... Romana Challans, and the 
&gt; elusive David Lloyd disappearing around a corner. I'm sure I'll meet 
&gt; more people (for that 2 seconds and 3d image!) as the main conference 
&gt; kicks in.
&gt; 
&gt; Wish you were here, etc etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Steve. :)

nice finally meeting you steve:) yes, dsl was in run amok mode, a v
busy man:))

i kept wondering if i should give out bags to poor emacs users, burdened
by their bad editor as they were...but i did anyway, with only a small
payout to pete gossner to be had for it...

actually, there were times when it was so busy, we didnt have time to
read what people used! pete did notice his list was half and half emacs
v vi, might examine at more leisure on next help desk stint:)

gosh lca is FUN - please peeps- if you can, GET THERE!!!!!!!!!

r, tired but had a blast (and saw linus too!)
