&gt;PHP, I belive is also a project born in the stable of IBM, a child 
&gt;of disgruntled programmers looking for 'something better' (TM) =)

I don't think that's true. From the history page in the PHP manual:

    PHP succeeds an older product, named PHP/FI. PHP/FI was
    created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1995, initially as a simple
    set of Perl scripts for tracking accesses to his online
    resume. He named this set of scripts 'Personal Home Page
    Tools'. As more functionality was required, Rasmus wrote
    a much larger C implementation, which was able to
    communicate with databases, and enabled users to develop
    simple dynamic Web applications. Rasmus chose to release
    the source code for PHP/FI for everybody to see, so that
    anybody can use it, as well as fix bugs in it and improve
    the code.

    PHP/FI, which stood for Personal Home Page / Forms Interpreter,
    included some of the basic functionality of PHP as we know
    it today. It had Perl-like variables, automatic interpretation
    of form variables and HTML embedded syntax. The syntax itself
    was similar to that of Perl, albeit much more limited, simple,
    and somewhat inconsistent.

    By 1997, PHP/FI 2.0, the second write-up of the C implementation,
    had a cult of several thousand users around the world
    (estimated), with approximately 50,000 domains reporting as
    having it installed, accounting for about 1% of the domains
    on the Internet. While there were several people contributing
    bits of code to this project, it was still at large a one-man
    project.

    [etc.]
