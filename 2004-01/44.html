Hi Robyn,

&gt; Your rudeness is unbecoming of someone new to our
&gt; community and doesn't
&gt; forward your cause well of becoming known.

Becoming known is not my cause nor is my aim to be
polite and correct. 
The fact that I am new to the list gives me a fresh
perspective, you should take that as positive
feedback.

&gt; Many subjects are discussed on this list ie Linux,
&gt; Linux Community, Our
&gt; various work situations and Life in General.

I don't intend to discuss life in general or work.
If it's linux related OK. I'm really not interested in
anyone's financial situation or what colour their
shirt is. Tell me about your computer, your laptop,
how you've integrated software packages and so on,
yeah? and we're away.

&gt; We try to be a supportive community.
You are promoting this as a supportive list. I am not
seeking support from this list, it's not a tea party
nor a knitting circle or some other casual get
together. I want creative ideas, solutions, critical
thinking, treatment of technical issues, pointers to
linux news and resources, maybe we could compile a
list.

grussen,
Gazza
