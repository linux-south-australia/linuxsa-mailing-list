&gt; It's funny how that machine is considered a no-hoper now... I remember 
&gt; running ADAM Internet with Linux on a pair of 486-66's, called "eve" 
&gt; and "eden". Obvious naming scheme, but it amused me at the time. :)


One of those old systems was still in use up to last year - there was 
one customer in some hard-to-communicate-with place in Egypt who was 
still using some function and couldn't/wouldn't change settings of his 
equally old system. The system's primary function was to stop working in 
the event of a power outage :)

&gt;
&gt; I see eve is gone, but eden (the name, not the machine) is still there.


Yes, the same name has been the nameserver for adam.com.au since it was 
registered over a decade ago - changing DNS servers is tedious :)
