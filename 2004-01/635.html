Jonathan,

&gt; If I was to buy a new 4wd from Toyota, i'd be pretty cynical of any 
&gt; "Toyota-sponsored.." reports saying Toyota 4wd's were best..

However, a discerning customer would not immediately discredit them either.
Discrediting a report from Toyota about Toyota or Company X by Company X
with no basis in fact is practising exactly what we all seem to agree is a
bad practice.

It's not quite so easy; let me turn this on its head: would we agree with
Microsoft if a study it conducted using its own researchers were to conclude
that open source software run using the Linux operating system gave a lower
total cost of ownership?

For this week and the next, consider me as Denethor; if you
wish the Steward's kindness, then make no haste to insult him, 
or the lands under his watch.
