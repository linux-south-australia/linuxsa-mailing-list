 &gt; 
 &gt; You have the theoretical right, but you don't have the ability to 
 &gt; prevent it.

Lets dwell on that point, Steve.

Is that an accurate comment?  *Can* I prevent it?  Is there anything 
whatsoever that you think I can do to prevent third parties from 
accessing my computer?

I don't think there is.  No matter what extent I go to, there's
always a way.  Firewalls have holes, OSs have unpatched bugs, and
computers which aren't connected to any networks whatsoever can be
socially engineered.  Even if none of those things happen, my
computer can be destroyed by someone blowing it up from a distance.

You claim your background is military security, focussing on prevention;
So you'd know that there's no prevention.

None at all.

So what do we do?  Refuse to own computers?  No, that's stupid. 

All security measures, regardless of whether they're implemented by
people, technology, or steel walls and doors, have one thing in 
common:  They aim to adjust the cost/benefit analysis of whatever
attack they're trying to defend against.  They don't try to prevent
the attack in the first place (we've already established that 
that's impossible), they just try to make the attack more "expensive".

To a degree, all security is "lax" security -- so when you say the law
rewards lax security, that doesn't really have a big impact on me.

A firewall doesn't prevent breakins -- it just makes them more difficult,
more time consuming, less likely to succeed.  A steel door on a house
doesn't prevent breakins -- it just means criminals need to ram it 
with a larger object or employ tools or pick another entrance.

(and if they pick another entrance, then the door is 100% effective
as a countermeasure against a frontal attack through the door, right?)

As we've been discussing, a law doesn't prevent all attacks either.  But,
like all countermeasures, it makes the attacks more expensive.  An
attacker, when working out their cost/benefit equation, needs to 
factor-in information about the likelihood of spending time in jail
after successfully carrying out their attack.

There will be a class of attackers who will examine that cost/benefit
analysis and conclude that the attack isn't worth it, the cost is 
too high.  If that happens, THE COUNTERMEASURE IS EFFECTIVE.  Yes, it's
possible to say that the law prevents attacks by that class of people.

We all agree that there's another class of people who will perform
the same analysis and come up with a different result (e.g., Darren 
Kruse).  For those people, the legal countermeasure will be ineffective. 
But does that mean we shouldn't use it?

Of course we should.  When we catch people, they should be prosecuted
and punished according to the law, otherwise the law will be seen as
a countermeasure which is never used, and the first group of people 
above, who would ordinarily be deterred, will conclude that the 
chance of ending up in jail is low because the law is never used.

So we need to use it in order to reinforce its effectiveness.

You seem to be advocating ignoring the law, and welcoming attackers with
open arms.  If we did that, the legal countermeasure would be rendered
moot and attack attempts would increase.  Attackers who once wouldn't
bother would instead be encouraged (and perhaps encouraged again by
success if they're good at it), and the quantity and seriousness of
attacks would inevitably increase.

 &gt; &gt; If I disapprove, is it reasonable for me to have the ability to make
 &gt; &gt; them stop?
 &gt; 
 &gt; You have theoretical ability to pressure them to stop, but you don't 
 &gt; have the ability to enforce it.
 
Well, actually, I do, Steve.  Put them in jail for three years and 
I guarantee that they won't trespass on my property for at least three
years.  End of story.

 &gt; &gt; If I can make them stop by having them locked away at Yatala in a place
 &gt; &gt; which doesn't have any computers, is that an appropriate weapon in the
 &gt; &gt; arsenal of countermeasures available to me to combat that threat?
 &gt; 
 &gt; You have the theoretical countermeasure available to you, but you don't 
 &gt; have the ability to enforce it.

Why not?

 &gt; You have the theoretical right to approve or disapprove, but you don't 
 &gt; have the ability to enforce it.
 
But that doesn't mean I shouldn't attempt to enforce it.  If I don't
attempt to enforce it, the effectiveness of a legal countermeasure will
be undermined and the attacks will escalate.

That's not to say that the law is the only countermeasure that'll be 
used -- that'd be insane;  Nobody is going to pretend that a law which
makes it illegal to break into computers will magically secure them
so well that other security techniques aren't needed.  But if you're
going to tell me that this countermeasure which is not 100% effective,
but which successfully defends against at least *some* quantity of 
attacks shouldn't be used at all, then I'm going to have to question
your claimed credentials in military network security.

(especially since the military uses this countermeasure too:  Have you
ever researched the penalties available if you're prosecuted by the
Commonwealth for unauthorized access to a Defense computer?  Should
the Department of Defense decide that doorknocking scriptkiddies are
ok too, or should military computers be covered by different rules?)

 &gt; Proof? Make spam mail stop. Make viruses stop. Make DoS attacks stop.

I employ a variety of countermeasures to do my best to prevent those
things.  My spam countermeasures are about 95% effective.  My virus
countermeasures are 100% effective.  My DoS countermeasures are 
commercial-in-confidence.

If antispam laws became as globally-coordinated as kiddyporn laws (ie.,
if spam was illegal in every jurisdiction on the planet, with good
law enforcement cooperation to assist investigations), would you try
to tell me that there's some reason why I shouldn't use spam laws 
to protect my computer from spammers?  

Security is about trade-offs.  There's no such thing as perfect 
security, computers or no computers.  Countermeasures are supposed to
stack the deck in favour of the defender, and increase the cost of 
a successful attack to the point where most attackers conclude that
it isn't worth it.

You seem to argue that there are some countermeasures which defenders
shouldn't utilize.

I think that's... wierd, Steve.  Like, *really* wierd.
