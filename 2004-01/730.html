&gt; Why is it so hard to understand?  If I own a piece of property, I get

&gt; who unlawfully access my property should be prosecuted by the law.

Data is not property. Data is infinitely replicable, property isn't. 
This is the same misunderstanding that afflicts the RIAA and DMCA.

&gt; In the online world, people like you demand perfection.  Any chink
&gt; in our security armour is an invitation for an intruder, if one follows
&gt; your line of reasoning.  "Reasonable" efforts at security aren't
&gt; good enough;  the only way we can keep out "doorknockers" is by 
&gt; erecting
&gt; absolutely inpenetrable walls, and if we don't do that we're expected
&gt; to "understand" and protect the doorknockers from criminal sanctions.

The reasonable effort at security is to unplug your computer from the 
network. It's very easy and completely effective.

When you're plugged into the network, it's the same as being in a 
public place. People should be free to explore what is in public, and I 
certainly wouldn't be happy with trusting a bank that had not been 
thoroughly explored by a bevy of security experts AND amateurs.
