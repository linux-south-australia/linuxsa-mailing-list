&gt;&gt; However, I've had absolutely no luck getting the squid cvs + ipv6

&gt;
&gt; What issues, exactly?

I suspect the patch and the version from cvs don't quite match. The 
patch declares it's against the latest cvs, but I get several chunks 
failing to patch. Upon trying bootstrap.sh, it eventually stops with 
errors, and that's about as far as I got (well ok, I tried to run 
configure after that, but since the previous steps had errors, I wasn't 
hopeful, and that feeling was justified).  Admittedly I haven't spent a 
great deal of time on it yet, and will probably give it another go this 
evening.

&gt;&gt; Has anybody had any success with that, or have i386 (pref SMP) 
&gt;&gt; binaries/rpm for an IPv6 Squid or know of another proxy that works 
&gt;&gt; and runs under Linux ?
&gt;
&gt; I've seen it done (but not done it myself personally), so I definitely 
&gt; know squid will do the job.  Squid &gt; * in the land of proxies (it's 
&gt; like asking "What else is there apart from Samba?"), so I'd suggest 
&gt; sticking with trying to get it working.

Well yeah, I figured that was the case... Actually, talking of samba, I 
managed to compile up an IPv6 samba, but have nothing to test it with - 
MacOS X won't do smb over IPv6 as far as I can tell and even the WinXP 
box wouldn't see it (which leads me to think that maybe the samba+ipv6 
server isn't happy), but that's one for another day...
