&gt; Hi Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What are you planning on running on the laptop?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I had hopes of being able to type on it for recording meetings. 

Using something like vi or emacs?

&gt; Possibly running some presentations using HTML pages (the VGA outputs 
&gt; colour).

A little more difficult - browsers are very resource hungry. Have you
considered using MagicPoint? It's not too bad and I think it'll run over
svgalib (ie, without X) or the linux framebuffer.

&gt; Maybe have some network testing utilities so I could plug it into 
&gt; networks as an evaluation tool.

There's a few that come as part of busybox and the rest should link
happily against uclibc.

Rolling your own distribution can be good for a laugh (and may solve
your problem to an extent), but it's not easy. Do you often build
software from source and use the command line? If not, I'd look at
something else.

&gt; &gt; NetBSD in  particular happily installed on my MIPS DECStation,
&gt; &gt; which is a 20MHz  MIPS-based box with 8MB RAM and 200MB of hard
&gt; &gt; disk space. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now that is interesting. I have never run NetBSD but as an old CP/M - 
&gt; DOS command line freak from years gone by I could soon learn the 
&gt; techniques.

It's a flavour of Unix and like many of those, most of the tools you're
used to will happily run on one of the BSDs. I used to run NetBSD on my
laptop with Gnome, but this week it's FreeBSD with a real custom
desktop. I don't have a recent copy of any of the BSDs that have the
i386 binaries and some the binary packages you'd want. Places like
everythinglinux.com.au and lsl.com.au do box sets for i386 and I'm sure
there's someone out there willing to burn you a copy.

Greg Lehey (and others) can probably also give you details for
subscribing to the local BSD user's group too, if need be.

Hope it helps,
Matt
