Hi Peter

Thanks for your thanks.

Did you ever tell us what your modem is? If not what is it?

&gt; Thanks to all who have replied. Here are a few things I have learned:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. There seem to be 3 types of modems: hard (real) modems,
&gt; controllerless modems, and soft modems. Controllerless modems have
&gt; more hardware than soft modems but are still in reality soft modems
&gt; because they need special software to run them. You need to be careful
&gt; what you ask for because to some suppliers seem to think a
&gt; controllerless modem is a real modem.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Anything with a Rockwell or Conexant chipset is probably (perhaps
&gt; "certainly") a controllerless or soft modem. 
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Several people mentioned free drivers from linuxant.com. They might
&gt; have been free once but not anymore. (They do supply a free version,
&gt; but it is limited to 14k bps). 
&gt; 
&gt; David Fitch mentioned 3 cheap, apparently hardware, modems he found:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;"Discovery 56K Hardware Int PCI  Rockwell chipset" RRP $35
&gt; &gt;"DLink DFM-560I 56K PCI Hardware Modem" RRP approx $50
&gt; &gt;"Dynalink PCI 56K F/D Hardware Modem" RRP approx $40
&gt; 
&gt; This URL for the DLink modem says it uses the Rockwell chipset and
&gt; requires Windows:
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.dlink.com.au/products/modems/dfm560i/">http://www.dlink.com.au/products/modems/dfm560i/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Based on that, I suspect all 3 modems mentioned above are
&gt; controllerless, not hard, modems.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems it is hard to get a hard modem for under about $150. 
&gt; 
&gt; In case anyone else has to go through the same procedure, here is what
&gt; I did:
&gt; 
&gt; Rather than fork out for an expensive modem (since it'll only be for
&gt; work once I get ADSL going), I downloaded the 14k-limited driver
&gt; from Linuxant. It worked! And while it did indeed seem to enforce an
&gt; *average* limit of 14k bps (I did a whole pile of downloads and
&gt; averaged 1500 bytes/s), this was in fact faster than the same set of
&gt; downloads in Windows on my supposedly 45k bps line. So I suspect I
&gt; have a crummy throughput with my ISP (well it is only $1/hour with Big
&gt; Button), so I might as well stick with the (free) 14k bps limited
&gt; version. 
&gt; 
&gt; I had to do one thing to get it going: after dialing, the modem must
&gt; have had trouble with the dial tones because it kept returning the
&gt; "BUSY" signal after dialing. I fixed this by changing the dialing
&gt; string from "ATDT" to "ATX1DT". This causes the modem to not try to
&gt; determine whether the phone at the other end is busy.
&gt; 
&gt; (This was with a controllerless modem. Linuxant have drivers for soft
&gt; modems also).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I must say this whole process has made installing Linux a pain and
&gt; would dishearten many novices. Since the linuxant 14k versions are
&gt; free, perhaps they should be included in the standard Linux
&gt; distributions (perhaps they are).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again for everyone's help.
