Okay here's the story;

*** Disclaimer: I've only found out about this stuff since he went and
buggered things up ***

A friend of mine is installing SUSE 9.0 and wants a FAT32 partition to share
documents between Windoze and SUSE. Simple, right? Well he goes and mounts
the FAT32 partition as /home and has had no end of bother. I assume this is
because Linux tries to assign permissions to a partition which it cannot do
so to, yes?

Okay well he still wants that shared directory so I said, "Create the
partition and let SUSE pick it up and mount it onto your desktop as
/windows/C (or something like that)". Alternatively, if you wanted to make
the /home/[user] folder thing transparent with the FAT32 partition (i.e.,
when he clicks on /home/[user], it opens his FAT32 documents), symlink
/home/[user] to wherever the FAT32 drive is mounted (although, I'd prefer he
didn't do this because I would imagine that you could only control
permissions to the /home directory and not subsequent subdirectories).

So did I miss something? Is there a way to mount a FAT32 partition as your
/home directory or will the Linux folder permission thing just keep getting
in the way? I assume it will but I don't want to rule it out.
