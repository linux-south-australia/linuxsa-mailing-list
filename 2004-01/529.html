I have used the 504 quite a lot on private jobs (no we don't protect our
net casino with one).
If the customer already has a modem I use a DI-704p (router, 4port
switch and print server).
They are totally OS independant. You can route and NAT with them or open
up specific ports to either your lan or just one machine, dhcp, etc,
etc.
They have useful logging to assist in tracking problems.
The 704 is a bargain at ~$100. You pay that much just for a print
server.

On some jobs I use a 504/704 to feed into an SME server (old e-Smith).
This gives a linux f/w, workgroup/domain access via samba, email server,
backup, etc .
Its great for those 2-10 pc sized businesses and admin is VERY simple.

Never had anyone hacked nor ever had hardware failure.

My golden rule with permanent connection is stick a dlink router out
first then SME/Smoothwall/openbsd with pf or even XP's inbuilt crappy
firewall if that's all you got but never the less have 2 levels, one
hardware then one software.
If you just want a firewall, Smoothwall seems to rock.

The thoughts in this email are aimed at people who want something very
simple yet very effective. For the purist I suggest you buy openbsd and
use pf. It rocks better but is harder to configure ;-(

Hope this helps.

&gt; G'day all,
&gt; 
&gt; (and a special hello to the many names I recognise on this list),
&gt; 
&gt; I have some rather general questions about Linux ADSL security. Feel
&gt; free to call me ignorant and point me to an appropriate FAQ, if there
&gt; is one...
&gt; 
&gt; Internode recommend the DLink DSL-300+ (modem) and DSL-504 (modem +
&gt; router). I was planning on getting one of them, but:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Are there any special problems using these modems with Linux?
&gt; (A quick web search suggests "no")
&gt; 
&gt; 2. The following url suggests security problems with the DSL modems:
&gt; <A HREF="http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/10465">http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/10465</A>
&gt; Is this problem still current? Is it easy to fix?
&gt; 
&gt; 3. The router in the DSL-504 provides a firewall. Is this worthwhile?
&gt; (Or are the Linux software firewalls so good that it's not).
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Is it easy to put in a firewall under Linux? I have Red Hat 9, 
&gt; and I seem to recall something about firewalls during installation.
&gt; The following url talks about Linux ADSL security, but it is nearly 3
&gt; years old and refers to RH 6:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.skaht.com/linux/adsl/">http://www.skaht.com/linux/adsl/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Lots of general questions, I know. But I'm a lazy sod who prefers to
&gt; not muck around with configuration and get on with programming and
&gt; using the web. :-)
