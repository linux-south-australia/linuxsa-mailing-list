You could have just saved yourself the bother and assumed that
from the start.  :-)

&gt; Funny thing is that I've been mostly avoiding python as I had the
&gt; impression it wasn't matured enough as a production-use language

Yeah, it suffers from that perception.  I get to dabble with it
at a lower level than most (extending/embedding it), and really
appreciate it for that.  I tried to embed Perl in an application
once - those scars won't heal fast (although it may be easier
now).  Python has been written to make that sort of thing easy
(although I'm finding a few niggles regarding doing this under
Win32 which are going to involve a recompile of the interpreter
- oh well).  It's certainly been straightforward under Unix.

For example, regarding the current thread regarding Python and
GUIs, I've been writing my own module that talks directly to
Win32 to give Python GUI applications a native look and feel
under Windows.  It's just really forward to do (i.e. not rocket
science)(there are some toolkits that already do this - I'm
trying a different approach to be able to support some "special
needs").

&gt; I know what I'm going to be doing after LCA :-)

Yeah, well, I would have been more inclined to go to the LCA
if the Python mini-conf had actually stated what they were
going to do there.  I don't think the pig.slug page has
changed much since it went up. :-/

At least you still have your digital watch.
