&gt; For those who think what he did was ok, let me propose a
&gt; scenario.
&gt; 
&gt; Lets say you get home from the movies, your house appears to be
&gt; secure, but you find a note from me, .. blah blah

Not a bad analogy. However, If Id just forked out a couple of hundred
thousand dollars for Microsoft Home-Secure, and went around with a big
fat smile on my face believing my house to be 'secure', as per the
promises in the glossy brochures, then the analogy might be a better
one.

To complete the analogy, if this was the situation, then I would have
rights under some vague consumer laws to sue the pants off the provider
of the security system. That somehow never seems to apply in the case
where Microsoft is involved.

Im not sure if the tresspass analogy is entirely appropriate either from
the point of view of physical egress. Maybe you could say .. 'you get
home from the movies and there is a message on the answering machine
saying that I have observed your premises from a remote location using
my Acme-XRay binoculars, and discovered some vunerabilities in your
window latch.'  Id think you were a dangerous nutter perhaps, certainly
someone to be watched, but I would not go further than that.

-------------------

Whilst Im not advocating or condoning this sort of behavior, please
consider - for many people this IS a war, that has been fought now for
at least 10 years, and one where the stakes for the future are extremely
high. Add to that the fact that the enemy does not fight clean, and has
massive financial and political resources. In such situations, guerilla
warfare is born out of neccessity. Like all guerillas in all wars, once
the 'freedom fighters' are caught, they can expect to be on the wrong
end of a media circus, and then expect no quarter in their judgment or
sentencing. Freedom costs ...

This is really a tired old debate on whether or not 'The ends justifies
the means'. which usually boils down to the observer's perception of the
importance of the stakes at hand.

-------------------
and certain other industries. They just do a much better job selling
their case to the media than 

You also have to ask yourself what it is about computers and IT that
creates so many hackers, virus writers and general fanatics - we dont
see plumbers, electricians, cooks, accountants, or doctors running
around creating havoc and trying to 'bring down the system' in their
respective industries through desperate acts of sabotage. 

We do however see this sort of behavior in bus & train drivers
(transport union), Nurses, Teachers, Waterfront workers, The Greenpeace
& Anti-War crowd, etc.

So, I think Darren should be treated with the same level of respect as a
striking train driver. He is not just a naughty little boy who acted out
of boredom, he did it for a reason, and we should be allowed to know
what those reasons are.
