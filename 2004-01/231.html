Hi -

&gt; Sounds to me like you bought the wrong laptop.
It's not so bad. Initial install was very easy. Sleep state S3
(suspend-to-ram) actually *works* (even from X!). And it was cheap :).

&gt; based laptop. Or buy another laptop with a bigger battery. Some lappies have
&gt; the ability to have a 2nd battery attached.
It'll take a second battery in the DVD slot, which is what I'm going to
do. I might even go to a third - they're only $100 each (as opposed to
$500 for a genuine VAIO battery!).

Found an answer to the initial question at
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2003-December/msg00661.html">http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2003-December/msg00661.html</A> . It looks like properly-functioning ACPI will automatically try to reduce CPU power usage whenever it's idle. There's nothing left to gain after that. I booted into 'doze, set CPU speed to minimum, and observed that battery deteriorated at the same rate as full-speed, but idle, in linux.

&gt; If battery life is this important, it begs to be asked why you didn't think
&gt; of this when  you bought it?
Seems to me that battery life is uniformly bad, except for old machines
(&gt;4 hours on my old 486!), iBooks, and Centrino machines. 

Thanks,

Gwyn.
