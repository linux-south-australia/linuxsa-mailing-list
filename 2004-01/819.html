Howdy,

I've got the fun task of feeding in and editing all the LCA video/audio 
content.  Originally we were going to make a highlights DVD, but demand 
exceeded what I expected it to, and we're probably going to try and get 
most the taped talks out in MPEG4 format, at least downloadable, but 
perhaps on several DVD's.

I'm also looking for trustworthy (we've only got one copy of the tapes, 
so they're precious!) people to take some of the LCA MiniDV tapes and 
feed them into their computer, so we end up with DV content I can then 
edit.  I don't mind what platform you use; just as long as you can get 
back to me optimal quality DV media (it's important it's not compressed 
in another format) I can then edit.  Note though, each hour of footage 
is almost 13G, so you're going to need a lot of hard drive space and 
we'd need to work out some way of transferring the content.  Please 
email me if you can help.

R

(If anybody on this list happens to be a Mac user, who's familiar with 
Final Cut Pro, and have some free time on your hands you can volunteer, 
I'm possibly looking for help editing; let me know).

Also thanks to those cameramen onlist that helped out at LCA - you guys 
rock (Ben Wannan, Peter Gossner, Andrew Braund, Ian Loxton).
