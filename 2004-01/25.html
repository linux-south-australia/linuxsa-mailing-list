&gt; not all people have concession card, but still cant justify the money.
&gt; thats not a sob story, and its sodding rude to put it as such:)


[snip]


&gt; i just wish it was possible that such events could be more open to the
&gt; greater, struggling, coalface type community - to whom even 99 dollars
&gt; is a hefty whack. i know too many people on austudy who would prefer to
&gt;  eat, for example....


I don't want to comment on most of what Rom has said, because I do feel
for those who cannot afford to come.

I do want to clarify and simply say that this event is non-profit, the
organisers aren't getting paid to put it on, and we're only charging what
it's costing to put it on (you know how much it costs to fly someone from
Boston to Adelaide, put them up in a hotel and fly them home again?  Then
multiply that for all international speakers :-)

Some of the organising team have gone mostly without paid emplyment for
months so they could devote themselves to making LCA2004 rock.  (Wow).

Any money left over ("profit") goes to Linux Australia, which is only made
up of unpaid volunteers, for use in furthering Linux and Open-Source in
Australia.  If you're doing something worthwhile in OSS, consider applying
for a grant from them next year :-)

&gt; this is NOT a criticism of geoff, michael, david et al. i know shaun
&gt; didnt mean it that way either. its just we need to be aware of the
&gt; disparity in the community with info tech, and info tech related
&gt; events, and those who can afford them.


Thanks Rom.  None taken.


Independant of all this, Linux.Conf.Au is going to be absolutely
fantastic.  I can't wait...
