Hi Spyro,

To check the obvious first.
Have you been using 'adsl-setup' to setup your /etc/ppp/pppoe.conf
Are the settings in there correct ?

Is it a USB modem ?
If so, does it show up when you 'tail -f /var/log/messages' &
plug/unplug the modem from it's USB port ?

Have you tried installing rp-pppoe from source ?
There may also be a problem with the .rpm.

&gt; i am using roaring penguin's pppoe 'dialup' client
&gt;  
&gt; my local nic is eth1 
&gt; my dsl nic is eth0
&gt; and my ppp adapter is ppp0
&gt;  
&gt; Previously the connection was working fine until yesterday when the
&gt; isp changed the format of the username and some other networking
&gt; infrastructure (static ip number changed, dns servers changed etc) So
&gt; i changed the format of my username in the secrets file and it seemed
&gt; to connect, but i couldnt ping anything, this turned out because my
&gt; new static ip wasnt assigned to me and the old one wasnt valid
&gt; anymore, but sometime during the turn around period for my ip to be
&gt; renewed i started getting this in my /var/log/messages


Don't forget to change the format of your username in
/etc/ppp/pppoe.conf also, but do it via 'adsl-setup'

&gt; Dec 30 01:52:26 headache pppd[3021]: Exit.
&gt; 
&gt; To add more confusion to the system, I plugged the dsl modem in my
&gt; windows box and it connects fine.
&gt;  
&gt; I have looked everywhere for some kind of 'sensible' explanation, and
&gt; ive found that generally LCP errors come about due to either ISP or
&gt; exchange problems, but i dont see then how i can be connected under
&gt; windows and under linux it produces this error. 
&gt;  
&gt; I would greatly appreciate it if ANYONE has some clue as to why this
&gt; would be happening and if there is anywhere i should be looking... Ive
&gt; removed the ifcfg-ppp0 files, removed the ppp and rp-pppoe packages
&gt; and reinstalled them,  resetup the connection and it still occurs, so
&gt; i am well and truly stumped.


Regards,
Rick
