&gt; You have missed our point, but I was expecting you to do so.

&gt; (1) I know what's happening; those who can't, won't or don't care about
&gt;     Linux.Conf.Au are now trying to detract from it. *hmmm*

David, there is nothing that I've ever said or done (ever) that suggests
that I have ANYTHING but praise for Linux.Conf.Au and this last statement
accordingly is just plain OFFENSIVE...  I don't understand how illustrating
why it's not reasonable to ask people to come in 2 hours early to present a
decent digital copy of the conference - as well as having to PAY for the
priveledge of doing so - can possibly come under the catagory of detracting
from the Conference itself!!!???

As a matter of fact, I am so pro-Linux that I've been spending months
learning the O/S.  I've (thus far) converted 3 out of 5 of my personal
systems to it - and have even spent innumerable hours of my own time arguing
to try and prevent Optus from migrating (this year) from Macintosh to
Windows; as well as innumerable hours promoting Linux on both IRC and ICQ to
anyone/everyone who'll listen to me.  And while I won't be attending LCA2004
for personal reasons; I have never said/done or even suggested that I have
ANYTHING but the utmost of respect for the conference and/or its speakers --
and especially considering that I've never made comments about my views of
the price, I think your statements (above) are the perfect illustration of
why I've seen you in so many knock-down word wars over the last 4 odd months
I've been lurking here...

May I respectfully suggest that in future you take the time to proofread
over your E-Mail's looking specifically for comments that can be taken as
offensivly agressive unbased statements *such as the above* before hitting
your 'send' button?  :-)

David WOLVERTON
