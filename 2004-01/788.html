Nothing about crypto prevents it from being a broadcast medium.

&gt; I'm an Analyst, not a sysadmin (pretty clear I would have thought). 
&gt; You want
&gt; to tell me how the heck I should know???

SECMAN 3 isn't for sysadmins. I presume you mean you're an analyst in a 
non-technical area.

&gt; I do know that I'm writing this email on a Win95 box on a network 
&gt; running
&gt; Windows. Can't be terribly secure.

That's OK, as long as the sensitive information isn't on your Win95 box.

&gt; Look it's just my opinion but I agree with the official line on this 
&gt; one; if
&gt; someone tried to hack into the Police network and got busted, 
&gt; benevolent
&gt; intentions or otherwise, the law should tell them that it's NOT okay.

But you shouldn't rely on this, because there will be people who hack 
in and don't get busted. You have a duty of care to ensure that 
sensitive information is adequately protected, without saying "but 
but... we have a LAW that says you can't!".

So back to the original point... I would far rather be told of security 
problems by helpful hackers, than to discover weaknesses in malicious 
circumstances. I'm informed by the former, victimised by the latter.
