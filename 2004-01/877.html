&gt; If I own a computer, should I have the right to approve or disapprove

You have the theoretical right, but you don't have the ability to 
prevent it.

&gt; If I disapprove, is it reasonable for me to have the ability to make
&gt; them stop?

You have theoretical ability to pressure them to stop, but you don't 
have the ability to enforce it.

&gt; If I can make them stop by having them locked away at Yatala in a place
&gt; which doesn't have any computers, is that an appropriate weapon in the
&gt; arsenal of countermeasures available to me to combat that threat?

You have the theoretical countermeasure available to you, but you don't 
have the ability to enforce it.

&gt; So stop dragging it in, and answer the questions which form the
&gt; crux of this issue.  Should a property owner have the ability to
&gt; approve or disapprove of the uses to which his property is put?

Property again?

You have the theoretical right to approve or disapprove, but you don't 
have the ability to enforce it.

Proof? Make spam mail stop. Make viruses stop. Make DoS attacks stop.

&gt; Again, you're talking torts, we're talking criminal law. Totally

You're talking law (torts and criminal law), I'm talking military. 
Might makes right. What can be done will be done.

&gt; This was probably always going to happen given that you're not a 
&gt; lawyer or
&gt; in justice at all but you're missing the point of laws. They're not
&gt; protections but deterrants.

Precisely. My background is security for military networks. Engineer to 
prevent, not sue to redress.

I have achieved my objective of showing that this debate is more 
complex than "Private, Keep Out!". Legal deterrents lead to weaker 
security which can and will be exploited in the long term.

We'll have to agree to disagree from here on.
