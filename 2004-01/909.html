 &gt; &gt; If, on the other hand, you heard about it through some third
 &gt; &gt; party and decided to try it out for yourself instead of notifying
 &gt; &gt; the affected organization, I'm pretty sure that they'd have
 &gt; &gt; grounds to complain to the police.  After all, you didn't *have*
 &gt; &gt; to gain unauthorized access to the system, did you?  You could
 &gt; &gt; have just told them about what you'd "discovered."
 &gt; 
 &gt; What - so go telling an organization before I'd actually checked out
 &gt; whether what I was told was actually correct or not? 

Yes.  Why not?  If you'd heard from a third party that the living 
room PIR sensor on your next door neighbor's burglar alarm was
faulty you wouldn't break into their house to make sure before you
told them about it;  Why is a computer so different?

 &gt; I think I would be stupid to do that.  I would want to check the
 &gt; *facts* before I go to an organization and tell them.  The last
 &gt; thing I want is to tell an organization without checking whether
 &gt; it was actually true or not.

Why?  You have reasonable suspicion;  You use your post-primate
communication skills to frame a warning in terms which are realistic:
"I've heard from an unreliable source that if you do X, followed by
Y, followed by entering a URL which looks like this, it's possible
to see your credit card data.  You might want to check it out."

I don't understand this mindset which says the only way you can 
warn a third party about a security problem is by exploiting it
without their permission.

 &gt; But let's look at what the Act *actually* says about "gaining
 &gt; access without permission" that you are referring to Mark:
 &gt; 
 &gt; ======================================
 &gt; Summary Offences Act of SA Section 44:
 &gt; Unlawful operation of computer system 
 &gt; 
 &gt;         44. (1) A person who, without proper authorisation, operates
 &gt;         a restricted-access computer system is guilty of an offence. 
 &gt;       [ ... ]
 &gt;         (3) A computer system is a restricted-access computer system if-- 
 &gt;         (a)   the use of a particular code of electronic impulses
 &gt;               is necessary in order to obtain access to information
 &gt;               stored in the system or operate the system in some other
 &gt;               way; and 

That's the law's way of saying that you require an authenticator,
without mandating a particular *type* of authenticator.  They won't
say "password", they won't say "shared secret", they won't say, 
"proximity card" or "fingerprint reader", because to say those things
would restrict the operation of the law to computer systems which
used one of the authenticating methods they've described.

So the legislation speaks of "particular code of electronic impulses",
because that's what all of the above methods, and any other authenticator
you can imagine, will generate.

Note that a secret URL fits the bill, if "the person who is entitled
to control the use of the computer system has witheld knowledge of
the code [...], or has taken steps to restrict knowledge 
of the code [...] to a particular authorized person or class of
authorized persons."

Note that someone has "taken steps to restrict knowledge of the code"
if they've instructed an employee to secure it.  If that employee happens
to be incompetent and doesn't secure it well enough, that doesn't
mean the resulting system isn't "restricted access".

It's also still restricted access if a software bug means that some
means other than the code will permit operation of the system -- "taken
steps" is once again the key phrase.

Your reading of the law would enable anyone who was ever prosecuted
under it to defend themselves by saying, "It wasn't restricted access.
There was a bug in it which allowed me in without the password, therefore
I didn't need a particular code of electronic impulses at all!"  That
defense is highly likely to be rejected.
 
 &gt; Sorry Mark your argument loses complete credibility here, you
 &gt; make it publicly available from a web site then it's not restricted,
 &gt; this particular Act says I can access it.  Period.

But I don't think you're defining public in the same way that a 
prosecutor would.

 &gt; &gt; It's not "publically available" just because it's possible for
 &gt; &gt; the public to access it.  If you've gained unauthorized access
 &gt; &gt; to a restricted access computer system by exploiting the carelessness
 &gt; &gt; of a sysadmin, expect to be prosecuted.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I don't think so given the above.
 
So what circumstances would ever permit anyone to be prosecuted under
s44 of the summary offences act?  

Is there any unauthorized access at all, in your reading of the Act,
which would count as something that could slip through the "loophole"
you think you've found?

If so, let Darren Kruse know.  I'm sure he'll be interested.  I'm 
sure he'd be overjoyed to find out that because he didn't need any
passwords he's therefore not guilty.


 &gt; &gt; It also makes no difference whether you've copied that credit
 &gt; &gt; card data anyway.  Gaining access without authorization is the
 &gt; &gt; offence.
 &gt; 
 &gt; No - gaining access to a "restricted-access" computer system is
 &gt; an offence.  Not if it is publicly available information on the
 &gt; internet without a "code" to access it.  That's what the Act says...

A particular code of electronic impulses;  Not a password.  The
Act is broader than you make it out to be.

 &gt; Yes it does Mark, stop using the Act and read it for a moment,
 &gt; see 44 (2) (a) and (b) of the act, the "intent" has to be there
 &gt; and be proven, otherwise no jail sunshine.  No intent - no jail.

You're misreading "intent" too.  The law doesn't care whether you
intend to do damage, or intend to profit, or whatever.

It cares whether you intend to do whatever the Act says is illegal.

If you do it accidentally, you don't get prosecuted.  "Whoops, I 
didn't mean to add that root account;  I accidentally slipped and
hit F1, which triggered my `add root account' macro" might be a
reasonable defense.

But if you deliberately edited a password file to add a root account,
it doesn't matter *why* you did it.  You've intentionally done something
that is illegal;  Therefore the law sees intent.
 
 &gt; And rightly so they be prosecuted - if they intentionally do it
 &gt; they deserve everything they get.  Well - I'm only reading what
 &gt; the Act says - some of your arguments just don't hold up when you
 &gt; actually read the Act.

There's an Act called the Acts Interpretation Act which defines a
heap of concepts and terms which are used in other Acts of parliament.
You really need to read that to come to terms with issues like "intent",
"knowingly", and other necessary prerequisites for the commission of a 
crime.  I don't think those words mean what you think they mean.
