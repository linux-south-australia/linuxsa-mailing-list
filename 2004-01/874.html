&gt; Guess what?  -EVERYONE- has the alternative of sending an email message, having a conversation, making a phone call.  
&gt; All you need to do is ask permission, then you can give proof by demonstration if you're able.  Everything you think
&gt; should be allowed is possible;  you need only to ask first.

&gt; If you don't ask, you're wilfully and knowingly committing a crime, and there are consequences. 

(Throws pebbles at Mark's high-horse...) :)

So - for a theory - discovering a public ISP URL that allows me unmitigated access into your backend database (this is NOT an Internode or Agile case I might add) and I browse around, have a look and then notify you of it means I am liable for prosecution???  Even if I could or did copy credit card data for all the organisation's clients, which I could do because it is publicly available information, is that illegal because a careless sysadmin has rendered it publicly available?  (gee I thought they were timestamps - LOL).  If I add a root user to see if it works, is this also illegal?  No it's not.

If I do a search and one of the links opens up a pile of kiddie pr0n sites - which are illegal images to download in Australia - can I be prosecuted?  No I can not IMHO - there is no intent.

That's laughable.  There is no intent there at all, no damage done and could not be prosecuted IMHO.  Try to prove "wilfully and knowingly committing a crime" - you'll have a hard time doing it.  If something is open without any "keep out" signs there is no problems with people taking a look.  If a sysadmin leaves a gaping hole then people are entitled to walk through it, especially if that hole is publicly available.  Sysadmins can't hide behind the law for poor workmanship.

In essence I suppose it is a very murky area - which is the reason why so few people actually get prosecuted.  Proving actual damage and intent can be a very hard thing.

/me runs for cover....  :)
