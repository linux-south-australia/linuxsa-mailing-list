&gt;As someone who works with Internet all the time, one of my pet 
&gt;peeves is when I tell someone to use a perfectly good hostname in a 
&gt;web browser and through some kind of subconcious brain process they 
&gt;prepend 'www.' to it. These days I find myself adding 'www' cnames 
&gt;to DNS in advance rather than correcting people. 'UseCanonicalName' 
&gt;in Apache can also be a subtle way to make the point :)
&gt;
&gt;Given that the majority of domain names are used for just a web site 
&gt;and email, don't you find the 'www' somewhat superfluous?

The 'www.' can also reduce usability when passing (and parsing) URLs about.

Most e-mail clients parse recognisable URLs to an appropriate client 
app (mail, web, ftp &c) when the proper gesture is made 
(double-click, command-click, howl-at-the-moon-naked-then-click &c).

But e-mail is a fragile creature, and URLs within e-mails are more 
so. An errant line-break destroys many a URL. And many, perhaps most, 
folks don't have the technical skills need to repair a broken URL 
string.

Word-of-mouth (or word-of-e-mail, to be precise) is still the best 
way to get people coming to your site.

So, the shorter your URL, the better it travels. A good reason to 
banish those four characters from your URLs.

&gt;No! I think email domains should clearly have "email." prepended to 
&gt;the domain name, otherwise confusion would reign ("Won't somebody 
&gt;think of the children?"). Obviously context isn't enough for some 
&gt;people, so everyone else should be made to suffer. (As an added 
&gt;bonus, you could mix up the roles so that people ftp to the "email." 
&gt;domain name, mail to the "www." domain name and so forth).

This is what URL protocol qualifiers are for. 
&lt;<A HREF="ftp://betweenborders.com/&gt">ftp://betweenborders.com/&gt</A>; is different from 
&lt;<A HREF="http://betweenborders.com&gt">http://betweenborders.com&gt</A>; which is different again from 
&lt;mailto:<A HREF="mailto:bforte@betweenborders.com">bforte@betweenborders.com</A>/&gt; although each are hosted on the 
same domain.

These protocol qualifiers are also good e-mail ettiquette. Many 
e-mail clients parses fully-qualified URLs but, quite properly, leave 
bare machine names (eg betweenborders.com or even 
www.betweenborders.com) untouched.

Regards,

Brian Forte.
