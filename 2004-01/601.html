[ Perhaps this is slightly out-of-context in relation to the thread, but
  an allowable rant nonetheless. ]

&gt; &gt; Most of us in the open source world know that all this stuff is FUD[2],

&gt; &gt; it needs to be translated back into terms that bureaucrats understand.
&gt;
&gt; Has it been established who the "important people within government" are
&gt; ?
&gt; 
&gt; And why, exactly, do the bureaucrats need to decide (or even be aware of)
&gt; things like which version control tool the "people on the ground" use?

I reckon you've just gone and hit the nail on the head there, Stud.

In open source circles, there are too many techies and not enough
marketing types. You just can't sell products based on their technical
merit alone. It's a package deal.

&gt; In the government agency I work for, these things happen from the bottom
&gt; up - the fact our CEO or ICT manager, for that matter, doesn't know we use
&gt; CVS as opposed to something like SourceSafe has no impact on anything.

Exactly! Your ICT manager doesn't care about the nitty grity; he's there
to make sure that ICT objectives get met, that is to say, that your ICT
projects are completed and business value can be shown. The CEO cares
even less -- so long as each department meets its objectives, he doesn't
care how the hell it happens (within reason).

I can think of two contrasting examples. A mate of mine that I went to
school with was a brilliant programmer and put together some fantastic
Content Management Software. Thing was, he's one of the techie types
that likes talking as much as a back-bencher at Christmas time. When he
did talk, to try and sell the product, he used all 'em hacker terms --
FTP, WebDAV, Python, HTTP, RTF, DHTML. Rather than saying "this is what
it does, this is how it does it and this is how I'm going to support
it", he hit 'em with the lingo and subsequently got told to piss off.

Conversely, we just got ourselves a new firewall at work, sold to senior
management (not me!) by the IT company. They delivered a great
presentation that focused more on the business case with (relatively)
dumbed down tech-talk, saving that for a techie-to-techie conversation
later. Lo and behold, they (work) handed over the De Niro and was happy
in doing so. In fact, it wasn't until I quizzed the supplier that I
found out that it was running FreeBSD with their own firewalling
software. See? They didn't even have to tell our management that they
use open source to sell open source.

There's some progress in this field, but the open source marketing guys
have got their shoe-laces tied together and are doing a grand ol' job of
tripping over themselves.
