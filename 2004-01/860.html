Hi List,
This is more annoying but anyway
I was trying to move the home partition from hda1 to hdb1 on a freesco
gateway to provide more space and well I probably misread the steps but when
doing an init 1 I lost my connection to this as I was doing it remotely.

It isnt a big issue I will reboot when I get home but I have the following
questions.
some background: this thing uses umsdos filesystem and I have been able to
mount the 2nd disk without problems - the problem came when moving the /home
directory
etc my question is

if I follow the steps of mounting /home to a new partition what happens to
the old space?

eg
currently /mnt/router/pkg/home is mounted on hda1 (it's small disk 340mb
with 100mb swap and I wanted to setup a private web/ftp area and need the
larger capacity drive and install some more software like apache etc)
anyway I assume the command I want is

mount -t umsdos /dev/hdb1 /mnt/router/pkg/home

the router works a treat and I am loathe to change it for something more as
I can still run it from a floppy in it's original form. But as I said I was
wanting to beef it up with some 'essential' software.

Thanks
Evan
