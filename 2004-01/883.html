&gt;&gt; If I own a computer, should I have the right to approve or disapprove
&gt;&gt; of the actions of a third party which makes that computer do something
&gt;&gt; which I didn't want to happen?
&gt; 
&gt; You have the theoretical right, but you don't have the ability to 
&gt; prevent it.

And that makes it okay to do it?  Eh?  That's like saying you can't stop 
someone murdering someone else so it's okay.   Tell that to David 
Hooke's family.

We live in a society with reasonably agreed rules about how to behave. 
You're arguing over and over again that for some reason these rules 
shouldn't apply because somehow people interacting in "cyberspace" is 
different to people acting in the real world.

Crazy.
