Hi Michael,

Firstly, thanks for posting your budget.  These "real numbers"
are very useful to people thinking of organising events.


 &gt; I'm sure a $10-$20 lca fringe conf could be done if people put their
 &gt; minds to it.

An interesting comment, as I've done exactly this for previous
international computing conferences and meetings which have
been held in Adelaide.

Typically, I invite the better-known speakers to give a lunchtime
presentation in a lecture theatre I've scarfed for free from a
generous university faculty.  So for a week of lunchtimes people
can hear for free the highlighted speakers of the conference.

The turnout varies -- it's usually pretty small (&lt;50 people)
as when it comes to the crunch few people in the Adelaide
computing community find that they are that interested in
packet scheduling or time-use studies of e-mail clients.

Since I'm on the organising committee for linux.conf.au I
really haven't had time to do this.

If someone else wants to step up to the plate I'll arrange
a lecture theatre.  The conference programme is on the
web, and the speakers' e-mail addresses are well-known
enough to be found by Google.


Trying to hold a more substantial fringe event (such as
an exhibition) would be problematic.  Adelaide Uni will
barely cope with the 500-600 people that are coming now.
Using a more substantial venue (eg, the Convention Center)
is expensive, and that would make the tickets to the fringe
event unreasonably high.

You'll notice how good the Fringe Festival is at locating
and using the oddest of facilities, precisely to avoid the
problem of expensive space.  I don't think we are experienced
enough to be that clever (one of the downsides of volunteer
labour and of holding l.c.a in a different state each year).


One thing that could be considered for next year is
making the Saturday morning a free open day with an
programme like:

    Keynote, in an open air place so crowd size is no
      issue
    Best of presentations #1
    Best of presentations #2
    Thanks and close

Then the local community could hear the highlights of
the conference without any ill effects on the conference
itself.

Obviously the LCA2004 committee won't be doing LCA2005
(and, I can hear my family saying, "thank god").  But we
do keep a file of useful thoughts to pass along.  You're
more than welcome to contribute to it.


Regards,
Glen
