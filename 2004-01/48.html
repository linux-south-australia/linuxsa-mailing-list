&gt;&gt; Your rudeness is unbecoming of someone new to our community and
&gt;&gt; doesn't forward your cause well of becoming known.
&gt;
&gt; Becoming known is not my cause

I disagree with Robyn here.  In such a short time, I think you've done
a lot to become known.  Maybe Robyn really meant "respected".

&gt; nor is my aim to be polite and correct.

Why not?  I would have thought that both of those should be
everybody's aim.

&gt; The fact that I am new to the list gives me a fresh perspective, you
&gt; should take that as positive feedback.

You don't have to behave like a bull in a china shop to give a fresh
perspective.  In general, if you go to somebody else's party, you
should try to adapt to it, not tear it apart.

&gt;&gt; Many subjects are discussed on this list ie Linux, Linux Community,
&gt;&gt; Our various work situations and Life in General.
&gt;
&gt; I don't intend to discuss life in general or work.  If it's linux
&gt; related OK. I'm really not interested in anyone's financial
&gt; situation or what colour their shirt is. Tell me about your
&gt; computer, your laptop, how you've integrated software packages and
&gt; so on, yeah? and we're away.

If you want a discussion on a specific topic, you should start the
discussion.  It doesn't do anybody any good to chip in on a discussion
which doesn't interest you and then insult everybody involved.

&gt;&gt; We try to be a supportive community.
&gt;
&gt; You are promoting this as a supportive list. I am not seeking
&gt; support from this list, it's not a tea party nor a knitting circle
&gt; or some other casual get together.

Have you found out what it is yet?  It's up to you to find out what it
is, not to define it.

&gt; I want creative ideas, solutions, critical thinking, treatment of
&gt; technical issues, pointers to linux news and resources, maybe we
&gt; could compile a list.

There's plenty of this at the right time.  There are also things like
Geoffrey's original message, which, it seems, doesn't interest you.
That makes me wonder why you replied at all.

I'm a bit of an outsider on this list, and I certainly hae no
intention of defining how it should be run.  But if you were to show
up on lists that I maintain or for which I define policy, and behave
the way you have been doing so far, I would seriously consider
removing you from the list and blocking further mail from you.
