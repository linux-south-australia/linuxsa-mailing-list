&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A big thanks to all the LinuxConf organisers for an excellent week with
&gt; many highlights. Everyone did an amazing job and should be commended for
&gt; putting together such a great conference (and fun!).
&gt; 
&gt; A huge thanks too to the helpers, they all did a great job. 

werent the guys amazing? so much fun was had at the help desk!!!:)
my personal thanks for help with chris and other kids at various times,
and for making it a wicked fun time, and for the coffees to :
kim, rusty, janet, michael, ian, eva, julien, rob, george, the amazing mr
gossner, shaun, paul aka 'orange god who knows everything, ask him', geoff 'see him
for registrations/hard questions' bennett, the guys in the back room
'dungeon', and everyone else who helped out us helpers:)

shirts on the final day as a group...:)

even a retro get together for one would be nice:)

&gt; Special thanks to the helper at the IPv6 and SeLinux sessions (not sure
&gt; of his name) but he did an excellent job and was always only too happy
&gt; to help with anything anyone needed. Great work.

and many thanks to grant who did the auctioning at the dunking - he
didnt get mentioned, but he did a fantastic job...

&gt; And Michael did a great job at presenting, couldnt of chosen a better
&gt; presenter.

out so much, never too flurried or busy to not help, or at least
indicate who could - well done guys!
