Cheap Codegen 300W or greater from DIY IT supplies.  I buy most of my
cheaper gear from them (they are a cheap warehouse on Manton street near
Hindmarsh stadium)., and they look after their regular customers very
well. They dont know squat about Linux, but if enough people keep
bashing their ears about it, they will get there eventually. I keep
pushing them to sell their machines with Linux pre-installed just to get
an edge over the next guy.

I think about $45 for a 450W, which is a big chunky thing that is
relatively quiet but well cooled.

The 300's are a bit noisier than $150 power supplies, but they are
electrically good - see review at www.dansdata.com.

I use a codegen 300W in my main workstation with nVidia MX440/128MB. If
it is really hot, and Im running lots of 3D games, the system may crash
once a week, but that could be generally heat related - dont know.
Otherwise, rock solid. You problems may be heat or power, or both - its
too hard to tell, so attack both issues and see what happens.

For $100 you can get a codegen aluminium case with 300W supply -
includes front blue LED glow panel and a top mounted fan. The front is
pretty ugly plastic until you strip it down and spray paint the beige
plastic bits black or dark blue (or gloss red ?). The fan in the top
needs to be removed, and you dremel out the fan holes to make a nice big
hole instead, screw the fan back in, and it runs nice and quiet then.
(it still has an aluminum grill over the fan, but about an inch away
from the fan, so there is no noise). Swap out the 300W for a 450W or
550W, spray paint the plastic, do the fan grill mod, and for $150 you
have a superb aluminium case with custom paintjob, and a killer power
supply.

If you are seriously overclocking both the CPU and graphics card, or
just generally thrashing the whole thing in the heat, then consider 
water cooling - its not that extreme a step to take, reduces noise, and
permanently fixes all your heat problems. If it still crashes then, you
know you have a power supply problem.  If a big power supply does not
fix the problem, then Id bet that you have cooked a RAM chip. Boot
(most) linux distros from CD, and do :
boot memtest
to check that your RAM is OK before blowing any money on power supplies
or cooling.  (Download the SoL-diag boot CD from www.sol-linux.com for a
memtest bootable CD)

&gt; G'day,
&gt; 
&gt; I've found that a set of 4 P4 systems with a moderately aggressive
&gt; nVidia card are unreliable, with the video card showing corruption
&gt; on the initial boot screen, locking up during operation, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; There's a reasonable suspicion that the power supplies are to
&gt; blame (350W power supply, but a fairly generic brand rather than
&gt; a high-profile manufacturer).
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to source some reliable power supplies and swap over
&gt; the supply.  A major concern is reliability: I would like to
&gt; use a brand/model which will last a long time.
&gt; 
&gt; I've looked briefly at the following brands:
&gt; 	- Codegen
&gt; 	- PC Power and Cooling
&gt; 	- Antec.
&gt; 
&gt; Any feedback on people's experiences with these brands is welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm interested in hearing about Adelaide dealers for these brands,
&gt; and also in hearing about other brands (and associated Adelaide
&gt; dealer(s)) that people like because of their quality and
&gt; reliability.
&gt; 
&gt; cheers,
&gt;
