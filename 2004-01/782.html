&gt;Subject: SCO ANZ Announces IP License for Linux
&gt;X-cid: caldera.55667.2
&gt;
&gt;SCO Announces ANZ Availability of SCO Intellectual Property License
&gt;
&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
&gt;Sydney, January 20 2004
&gt;
&gt;The SCO Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: SCOX), the owner of the UNIXR operating
&gt;system and a leading provider of UNIX-based solutions, today announced
&gt;the availability of the SCO Intellectual Property License to companies
&gt;and organisations in Australia and New Zealand.
&gt;
&gt;The company began the worldwide roll out of the license in the UK,
&gt;France and other European countries last week, and plans to make the
&gt;license available to many more countries and regions by February 1.
&gt;
&gt;The SCO Intellectual Property (IP) License permits the use of SCO's
&gt;intellectual property, in binary form only, as contained in Linux
&gt;distributions.  By purchasing the license, customers are properly
&gt;compensating SCO for the UNIX source code, derivative UNIX code and
&gt;other UNIX-related intellectual property and copyrights owned by SCO as
&gt;it is currently found in Linux.
&gt;
&gt;Pricing:
&gt;The SCO IP License is currently available at introductory pricing of
&gt;AUD$999.00 per server processor and AUD$285.00 per desktop processor.
&gt;The company is also offering the license to embedded device
&gt;manufacturers that use Linux to run their devices.
&gt;
&gt;In addition to extending the license to customers worldwide, the company
&gt;also announced that the license will shortly be made available through
&gt;select SCO resellers.  SCO resellers who are interested in obtaining
&gt;more information about providing the SCO IP License to their customers
&gt;can contact SCO at <A HREF="mailto:anz_info@sco.com">anz_info@sco.com</A> after February 1, 2004.
&gt;
&gt;"While we have identified several problem areas at issue within Linux,
&gt;we also want to be fair to customers and allow them to continue using
&gt;Linux and our intellectual property unencumbered," said Chris Sontag,
&gt;senior vice president and general manager of SCOsource, the intellectual
&gt;property licensing and protection division of The SCO Group, Inc.  "We
&gt;believe the SCO IP License helps customers satisfy the legal
&gt;requirements to continue using SCO's UNIX intellectual property in Linux
&gt;in a forthright way while properly compensating the company for use of
&gt;its property."
&gt;
&gt;Kieran O'Shaughnessy, SCO's Regional General Manager, Australia and New
&gt;Zealand, said he will begin briefing the company's local distributors
&gt;this week regarding the SCO IP License's introduction.
&gt;
&gt;"The SCO IP License helps organisations in Australia and New Zealand to
&gt;protect and leverage the investments they have made in Linux while
&gt;providing the means for them to continue day-to-day business without
&gt;interruption," he said.
&gt;
&gt;Availability:
&gt;Commercial business end users of Linux, based on the 2.2 kernel and
&gt;later, that are interested in more information or in purchasing the SCO
&gt;IP License in Australia or New Zealand can call +61 2 9440 7577 or
&gt;e-mail SCO at <A HREF="mailto:anz_info@sco.com.">anz_info@sco.com.</A>
