&gt; IIRR, the 2004 model Dell 8600 has a 128 or 256 MB ATI9600 Mobility =)

No kidding.  I've got a 64MB ATI9600 Mobility in mine, and I thought I
was lucky.  I haven't got it for games, though (although it runs UT2003
pretty nicely).

&gt; &gt; Does this even exist?
&gt; 
&gt; maybe, i think the Dell M60 has a 256MB nVidia ... but can't be sure,
&gt; i had to look for this last year as an artist wants to run
&gt; 3D Studio Max on his laptop, but we settled on the 8600 with a 9600m

nVidia cards are known for terrible 2D performance, so the ATI purchase
was more sensible IMHO.  I miss my Matrox G400, that was a damn nice
card.

&gt; &gt; If you want to play games, a laptop's *always* going to be slower than a
&gt; &gt; same-spec'ed desktop, no matter what.
&gt; 
&gt; true but there are some quick laptops out there now.
&gt; 
&gt; lots of the laptop vendors have model that can take up to 2GB of ram.
&gt; combine that with, say a ATI9600M and you're in business =)

But remember the CPU's in laptops are almost always slower than their
big brother counterparts, due to power usage, and an ATI Radeon Mobility
9600 doesn't compete at all with modern desktop video cards.  It does
OK, but certainly not high end.
