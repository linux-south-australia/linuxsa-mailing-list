&gt; &gt; Hello all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have multiple desktops configured under Mandrake 9.1, KDE and have
&gt; &gt; "Pager" on the Panel bar.  Pager shows the various desktops and seems to
&gt; &gt; work fine, except for one very irritating thing: whether I'm working in
&gt; &gt; one desktop or another, suddenly the desktop will change to another one.
&gt;
&gt; your not accidently hitting a keyboard shortcut are you? :)

;-) It'd be good if it was that simple, but alas not.  The switching occurs 
whether or not I have my hands anywhere near the keyboard.

That said, it might have something to do with mouse movement.  I can walk away 
from the computer for hours and come back to find the desktop that I left, 
still active.  So unless, Pager's left then returned to that desktop, it 
seems that some input is required on my part in order for this switching to 
occur.  Probably mouse movement I'd guess ?

Anyway, what are the shortcuts for Pager ? 

&gt; &gt; There appears to be no particular pattern to this activity, since the
&gt; &gt; desktop that KDE changes to might have no files open/programs running, or
&gt; &gt; it may have a heap of them running.  That said, it does tend to take me
&gt; &gt; more often to a desktop where there are files open.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm running Mandrake 9.1 and so it's possible that this 'bug' might have
&gt; &gt; been fixed in whatever version of Pager is in 9.2.  I've googled around a
&gt; &gt; bit but haven't yet found which rpm package Pager belongs to, and
&gt; &gt; therefore which package to upgrade.  Short of doing an install of 9.2
&gt; &gt; (probably a bit of overkill) can anybody suggest what package I should be
&gt; &gt; seeking to upgrade here please ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Andrew
&gt;
&gt; regards
