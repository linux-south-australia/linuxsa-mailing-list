&gt; Hi Robyn,
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Your rudeness is unbecoming of someone new to our
&gt;&gt; community and doesn't
&gt;&gt; forward your cause well of becoming known.
&gt;
&gt; Becoming known is not my cause nor is my aim to be
&gt; polite and correct.
&gt; The fact that I am new to the list gives me a fresh
&gt; perspective, you should take that as positive
&gt; feedback.

Somewhat arrogant  aren't we ?

&gt;&gt; Many subjects are discussed on this list ie Linux,
&gt;&gt; Linux Community, Our
&gt;&gt; various work situations and Life in General.
&gt;
&gt; I don't intend to discuss life in general or work.
&gt; If it's linux related OK. I'm really not interested in
&gt; anyone's financial situation or what colour their
&gt; shirt is. Tell me about your computer, your laptop,
&gt; how you've integrated software packages and so on,
&gt; yeah? and we're away.
&gt;&gt; We try to be a supportive community.
&gt; You are promoting this as a supportive list. I am not
&gt; seeking support from this list, it's not a tea party
&gt; nor a knitting circle or some other casual get
&gt; together. I want creative ideas, solutions, critical
&gt; thinking, treatment of technical issues, pointers to
&gt; linux news and resources, maybe we could compile a
&gt; list.

I would hazard to guess that you have subscribed to the wrong list. 
This list *is* about community, and all that goes along with that, with 
a Linux slant. Sure, technical discussions are held here, but so are a 
lot of other discussions, if you don't like that, or it's not what 
you're after, leave.

Dave
