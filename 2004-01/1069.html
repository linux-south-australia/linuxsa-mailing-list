<H1>Introducing Next Office</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
Got an email from a PC supplier I deal with sometimes.
It sounds a lot like openoffice but going to the website
it's a bit hard to tell.  Under the faq page it mentions
the names "writer", "calc", "impress" etc so sounds like
open or star office rebadged for the chinese market.
Anyway thought people might be interested...

(PS. sorry for dodgy formatting, it's from a html email)
Dave.
                
                
                Dear Resellers,
                 
                Microsoft is way too expensive, unreasonably expensive;
                Next Office is much lower in price but its functions are
                about the same as MS Office.  Next Office has the Open
                file formats that are international standard set by W3C,
                the worldwide organization that also set the standard in
                Internet such as "www." in all Internet addresses.
                 
                Now I'd like to introduce you about Next Office with
                which HP, Compaq and NEC PC/Notebooks in Hong Kong have
                been bundling their home-PCs and Notebooks in Hong Kong
                sales.
                 
                'Next Office' runs smoothly on all Windows
                XP/2000/NT/Me/9x platforms.
                 
                Next Office is the most versatile office-suite that is
                similar to Microsoft Office.  It includes Word
                Processing, Spreadsheet, Presentation and Vector Drawing
                and all these applications are compatible to MS
                Office. So it can open and save documents in Word, Excel
                and PowerPoint file formats.  For users who are familiar
                with MS Office, Next Office is easy to use. It offers
                all of Office's best features, such as spell checking,
                version-control and document-reviewing
                capabilities.  Next Office also supports XML open file
                format, defined by W3C.  XML is emerging as the new
                standard worldwide.  In addition, Next
                Office has powerful features like Text-to-Speech and
                Voice-enabled-Dictionaries.  For Professional Edition
                users, upon registration, users can enjoy one year free
                version upgrade that can be downloaded from
                www.nextoffice.net.
                 
                Next Office has the following benefits:

                freely. 
                 
                2. Chinese and English Voice Dictionary
                You can highlight the word and click the button of

                the speaker buttons, the dictionary will read the words
                and corresponding translations in English and Mandarin.
                 
                3. Text-To-Speech Capability in all 4 applications
                You may select the text content and click the button
                of“Next Speech” button, Next Office will read the
                selected text in English and Mandarin for you.
                 
                4. Output in PDF formats for all applications
                You can converted your documents prepared in the Next
                Writer, Next Calc, Next Impress and Next Draw into
                widely accepted PDF file format.  Next PDF output is the
                best among all office-suites in the world.
                 
                5. Mail-merge Mass Fax and Mass Email
                The mail-merge mass fax and mass e-mail function allow
                you to send large quantity of personalized email or mass
                fax to your customers for marketing purposes, without
                the need of the fax agent like WinFax (only for Windows
                xp users).
                 
                6. Bundled with large amount of clipart, templates and
                fonts
                Next Office comes with large quantity of clipart,
                presentation templates, certificate templates produced
                by professional designers in addition to the licensed 18
                Arphic Chinese True-type fonts.
                7. One-year free upgrade via Internet

                one-year free upgrade guarantee. Users can download new

                our website www.nextoffice.net and then use Next Office
                to open your MS Office files like .doc or .xls and see
                how well Next Office works.  If interested, I'd obliged
                if you could give me a reply.

                Frequently Asked Questions:
                 
                1. How to ensure the dealers selling oem pack with their
                PC in hard bundle?
                
                Ken: Our oem version is different from Retail version in
                packing.      The packing is different for oem and has
                no DVD box.     Different in content is outlined in my
                last e-mail's attachment.  OEM licenses has no rights
                for free new version upgrade.
                2. How can users register?
                Ken: There are two ways that users/customers can
                register their Next Office and hence get
                their one-year free download of new version upgrade: 
                      a) By fax of the registration form (the customer
                can print the registration during the process of
                installing Next Office)
                      b) On the web site: <A HREF="http://www.nextoffice.net">http://www.nextoffice.net</A>
                 
                You: Do you have English version in Next Office's
                website? 
                Ken: Yes, our website has 3 languages. 
                     Please turn (click) the language button on the top
                left corner.
                 
                You: Is Next Office compatible with MS office ?
                Ken: Yes, our is the best in terms of compatibility to
                MS Office. 
                     We are about one year ahead of Star Suite.
                     Users can save in Microsoft file formats and export
                files as pdf.
                     When you send pdf files to anyone, there is no
                compatibility issue. 
                 
                You: This product equal to MS OFFICE XP PRO OR MS OFFICE
                XP SBE?
                Ken: Next Office is similar to MS Office but we have no
                database.  
                     Our database is MySQL. From our survey, about 15%
                Office users use database.   
                
                
                We are selling very well in Hong Kong.  Many SME
                companies in Hong Kong are
                adopting Next Office.  We sold over 30,000 this year
                just in Hong Kong.
