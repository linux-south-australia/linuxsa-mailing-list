&gt; (Throws pebbles at Mark's high-horse...) :)
&gt; So - for a theory - discovering a public ISP URL that allows me
 &gt; unmitigated access into your backend database (this is NOT an
 &gt; Internode or Agile case I might add) and I browse around, have
&gt; a look and then notify you of it means I am liable for prosecution???

This is stupid, Paul.

You know as well as I do where the line in that case would fall.
As you posit in your email message, it comes down to intent.

You've hypothesised that the url was "discovered."  How was it
discovered?  Would the hypothetical individual under discussion
have heard about it and decided to exploit it for themselves,
or were they the source of the discovery?

If you innocently discover something like that and notify the
organization concerned, I'm pretty sure that no prosecution would
be forthcoming, and that if one *was* forthcoming that you'd win.

If, on the other hand, you heard about it through some third
party and decided to try it out for yourself instead of notifying
the affected organization, I'm pretty sure that they'd have
grounds to complain to the police.  After all, you didn't *have*
to gain unauthorized access to the system, did you?  You could
have just told them about what you'd "discovered."

As you say, intent matters.  s44 of the Summary Offences Act
in SA makes it unlawful to gain any access whatsoever to a
restricted access system without permission.  The concept of a
"restricted access" system is well-defined in the law;  So is
the concept of permission.  It makes no difference under the law
whether you downloaded credit card numbers, altered data, or
discovered secrets which you weren't supposed to see.  The mere
act of gaining access without permission is an offence, regardless
of whether you profited, benefited or caused any damage.

So:  you've made this "discovery".  What would you do about it?
It isn't hard for a court to make an assessment of "intent"
based on the answer to that question.

&gt; Even if I could or did copy credit card data for all the
 &gt; organisation's clients, which I could do because it is publicly
&gt; available information, is that illegal because a careless sysadmin
&gt; has rendered it publicly available? 

It's not "publically available" just because it's possible for
the public to access it.  If you've gained unauthorized access
to a restricted access computer system by exploiting the carelessness
of a sysadmin, expect to be prosecuted.

It also makes no difference whether you've copied that credit
card data anyway.  Gaining access without authorization is the
offence.

I'd recommend that anyone in South Australian jurisdiction who
is planning on breaking into a computer somewhere look the law
up.  It's a very powerful and broad piece of legislation which
extends trespass to include computer systems.  The penalties
are, shall we say, pretty serious.


&gt; (gee I thought they were timestamps - LOL).  If I add a root user
 &gt; to see if it works, is this also illegal?  No it's not.
[...]
 &gt; - can I be prosecuted?  No I can not IMHO - there is no intent.
&gt; That's laughable.  There is no intent there at all, no damage
 &gt; done and could not be prosecuted IMHO.

You're proposing that a court, when confronted with evidence that
you'd added a root user, wouldn't conclude that you had intent to
gain unauthorized access to a restricted access computer system,
and that adding the root user wasn't illegal?!

What planet are you on, Paul?  Are you serious?

The law doesn't care whether you had intent to steal, alter or
destroy data.  The law cares whether you knowingly entered
without permission.  That's all that matters.  Go directly to
jail, do not pass "Go", do not collect $200.  If you compound
the illegality by altering data (e.g., adding a root account),
how many other charges do you think you'll be clocking up?

&gt; In essence I suppose it is a very murky area - which is the reason 
 &gt; why so few people actually get prosecuted.  Proving actual damage
 &gt; and intent can be a very hard thing.

It's not a murky area.  Section 44 of the Summary Offences Act
was enacted in the late 80's.  Some of the members of this list have
been successfully prosecuted under its terms;  there's a volume of
caselaw supporting it.

It's not ambiguous.  You've just drawn the line between criminality
and legality in the wrong place.
