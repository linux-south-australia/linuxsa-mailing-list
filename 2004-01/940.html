Once upon a time Geoff Russell tapped upon the keyboard...

&gt; P.S. This post is about as much on topic as many others lately ;-)
&gt; 
Philosophically, (Ooh, what a big word; I hope I'm using it
correctly) there's some similarities between the bicycle and free
software "movements".

One time in history, a long time ago, bikes were what everyone used
to travel and move stuff around; just as once long ago software was
free and you could play with the source as much as you liked.

Then along came the evil oil companies who made the governments
around the world to tear up their train/tram lines, replacing them
with buses and the private car and cause the place to become
unpleasant for cyclists and pedestrians; and along came the AT&Ts
and Microsofts who said "No, you don't own it, you're just allowed
to use it. No you can't use it however you like, you can only use it
in the way in which we say." and then bribed the governments to
introduce things like DRM to make the lives of the FS developer
unpleasant.

Now, people of the world are realising that MS Windows isn't all
it's cracked up to be, and they are seeking other ways to do things.
And now oil is beginning to run out and maybe soon, people will
begin to realise that having a car isn't all it's cracked up to be
and they'll ride a bike.

 (An attempt at making this on topic).

 Michael.
