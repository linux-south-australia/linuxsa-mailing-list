&gt; &gt; Just been given an old laptop (thanks Shaun) and I need to put a
&gt; &gt; version of Linux on it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It is a Packard Bell Statesman plus. I think it is in the 200C series
&gt; &gt; model 810415. It has 7.4 M of ram (I think one of the chips is U/S), a
&gt; &gt; Cyrix 486 CPU and a Seagate 200 M hard drive. It has a floppy drive, 16
&gt; &gt; bit PCMCIA slot plus connectors for PS2, LPT, 15 pin VGA (outputs to
&gt; &gt; the CTR in colour - neat) and 9 pin COM port.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Firstly I need to get it on the network so I can store the current OS
&gt; &gt; images in case I need to recover them one day. Then find a way to
&gt; &gt; install a distro of some kind.
&gt; 
&gt; You'll need a 16-bit PCMCIA network card - not 32-bit cardbus, which 
&gt; although /may/ fit, won't work.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was thinking of Morphix or something like that which has been
&gt; &gt; optimised for the low-spec machine. With such low ram (and max has been
&gt; &gt; fitted) chances are that most downloadable packages will be too much
&gt; &gt; for installing on this little beast.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have discussed this with several at LCA including some of the greats.
&gt; &gt; No wonder Linus signed it with "Good Luck" and Bdale signed it with a
&gt; &gt; Debian symbol suggesting that it was probably the only thing from
&gt; &gt; Debian I would be able to get on it. Somebody has a photo of the
&gt; &gt; signing ceremony, would love a copy of it please.
&gt; 
&gt; Heh, Linus signed 'the goat' too :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions on which distro and how to install it?
&gt; 
&gt; Debian should install on it, I think :-)

Possibly, but not highly likely. You'll find that slackware probably
won't either. Many general purpose Linux distributions have a tendency
to use a reasonable sized ramdisk and quite a generic kernel. You'll
often end up having trouble on machines with less than 12MB or 16MB of
RAM.

What are you planning on running on the laptop? On a machine with that
little hardware, I'd build my own. It sounds like a danting task, but if
you know a bit about how your operating system works, you should be
fine. There's a replacement for glibc called uclibc
(<A HREF="http://www.uclibc.org/">http://www.uclibc.org/</A>), which is designed to be quite small. This
coupled with busybox and friends (<A HREF="http://www.busybox.net/">http://www.busybox.net/</A>), you'll have
a fairly standard-looking linux command line (with a few notable
omissions) in a few MB at most. It'd only take 20 minutes on a fairly
average machine to compile the two from source and a bit longer to
transfer it onto the box (or less if you stick the laptop HDD in your PC
temporarily).

It's possible to compile XFree86 4.3.0 to use the Linux Vesa Framebuffer
kernel driver. Compiled, it's around 700kB and is suitable for remote X
connections, etc. You can run local X applications, but you'll need to
build library dependencies against uclibc, etc, etc. This is where it
starts to get a little time consuming.

Or you could install NetBSD or OpenBSD. Both of which seem happy to
install/run on a machine with that little RAM and disk. NetBSD in
particular happily installed on my MIPS DECStation, which is a 20MHz
MIPS-based box with 8MB RAM and 200MB of hard disk space. It used to run
Ultrix, but I fixed that :-)

Hope it helps.

thx,
Matt
