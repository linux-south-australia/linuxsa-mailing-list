Hi all,
Its me again with the same questions.
Well after about a week of trying to get the ISDN card (netjet travervse
technologies) working under linux.

Well what I have found, yes the kernal does have the card in it as a
module (ya I dont have to complie kernals).

Problem. The ISp that I use has a portmaster 4 as the dial in to device
and only accepts 56K Data Over Voice and 64K data (thats a dollar per
hours per channell of 64k)

Whilst trying to get the blasted thing working, even talking to traverse
technology for help, I was spose to install a isdn4linux.ter.gz blar blar.
well the one on it is newer and during to --force it spat it.

well broken linux.

NOW what I am asking is there ANYBODY in adelaide that is willing to get
paidied to make my 56k dov isdn card work?

Or do I pay more money to cisco for more memory for the later IOS and use
that???

Anyway to get all my home services back on to the net (temp) winblows is
been used, pfft, spewing???


Come one some one has to know how to get 56k dov working.

Cheers a very stressed out Paul....
