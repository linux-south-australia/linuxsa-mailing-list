Clarkconnect / ipcop / smoothwall are all dedicated firewall dists, any
left over space is used for logs and squid proxy. They do not co-install
with any other OS, so don't try and install it onto a machine with
anything important on it ;)

The specs are fairly low, any machine that is pentium or higher, with a
couple of gig HDD and 32mb+ of ram will make a good box.

To install you burn the ISO to a cd, and stick in the cdrom drive and
reboot. If you machine is set to boot off cd the install will start and
you get asked a few questions and it should install fine. One installed
you useally have to use a browser to access the web interface, but check
the dists manuals.

I would install Smoothwall v2, I've always been impressed with the speed
they release patches for exploits etc... Never used ClarkConnect.

&gt; I am currently looking at Clarkconnect <A HREF="http://www.clarkconnect.com">http://www.clarkconnect.com</A>
&gt; From what I could see it's a RH clone with pretty much html UI for
&gt; management
&gt; I was wondering if it's all that different to a well setup RH box? (of which
&gt; I am incapable of achieving)
&gt; 
&gt; Also, it states it only needs 1gb of disk but how much is left?
&gt; What is included?
&gt; ftp/web/php etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Another alternative is ipcop but I haven't found the requirements for it
&gt; yet. Anyone have experiencer with this?
&gt; 
&gt; The reason for my possible move from freesco is it's inability to run poptop
&gt; (or m inability to set it up) people have done so but I can't seem to do it.
&gt; I even read the documentation (cough).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway all info appreciated
&gt; 
&gt; Evan
