&gt; &gt; For those who think what he did was ok, let me propose a
&gt; &gt; scenario.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Lets say you get home from the movies, your house appears to
&gt; &gt; be secure, but you find a note from me, .. blah blah
&gt; 
&gt; Not a bad analogy. However, If Id just forked out a couple of
&gt; hundred thousand dollars for Microsoft Home-Secure, and went
&gt; around with a big fat smile on my face believing my house to be
&gt; 'secure', as per the promises in the glossy brochures, then the
&gt; analogy might be a better one.
&gt; 

Hmm, this is a common problem. People assume that by buying
security technology and tools, they are automatically secure.
They feel they have ticked the security "checkbox", and don't
have to worry anymore.

Security tools out of context are provide perfect security,
because they don't have to provide any security. Put them in
context, and then your security is totally reliant on how those
security tools are used.

If you buy the best deadlock for your house, and then you
leave it sitting on the table, rather than installing it in the
door, can you then sue the deadlock vendor for a product failure
when you are broken into ? 

&gt; To complete the analogy, if this was the situation, then I
&gt; would have rights under some vague consumer laws to sue the
&gt; pants off the provider of the security system. That somehow
&gt; never seems to apply in the case where Microsoft is involved.
&gt; 
&gt; Im not sure if the tresspass analogy is entirely appropriate
&gt; either from the point of view of physical egress. Maybe you
&gt; could say .. 'you get home from the movies and there is a
&gt; message on the answering machine saying that I have observed
&gt; your premises from a remote location using my Acme-XRay
&gt; binoculars, and discovered some vunerabilities in your window
&gt; latch.'  Id think you were a dangerous nutter perhaps,
&gt; certainly someone to be watched, but I would not go further
&gt; than that.
&gt; 
&gt; -------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst Im not advocating or condoning this sort of behavior,
&gt; please consider - for many people this IS a war, that has been
&gt; fought now for at least 10 years, and one where the stakes for
&gt; the future are extremely high. Add to that the fact that the
&gt; enemy does not fight clean, and has massive financial and
&gt; political resources. In such situations, guerilla warfare is
&gt; born out of neccessity. Like all guerillas in all wars, once
&gt; the 'freedom fighters' are caught, they can expect to be on the
&gt; wrong end of a media circus, and then expect no quarter in
&gt; their judgment or sentencing. Freedom costs ...
&gt; 
&gt; This is really a tired old debate on whether or not 'The ends
&gt; justifies the means'. which usually boils down to the
&gt; observer's perception of the importance of the stakes at hand.
&gt; 
&gt; -------------------
&gt; and certain other industries. They just do a much better job
&gt; selling their case to the media than 
&gt; 
&gt; You also have to ask yourself what it is about computers and IT
&gt; that creates so many hackers, virus writers and general
&gt; fanatics - we dont see plumbers, electricians, cooks,
&gt; accountants, or doctors running around creating havoc and
&gt; trying to 'bring down the system' in their respective
&gt; industries through desperate acts of sabotage. 
&gt; 
&gt; We do however see this sort of behavior in bus & train drivers
&gt; (transport union), Nurses, Teachers, Waterfront workers, The
&gt; Greenpeace& Anti-War crowd, etc.
&gt; 

I see the issue as far simpler. Why do user accounts have
passwords ? To prevent unauthorised acess.

Did Darren have permission to attempt to access accounts he was
not authorised to ? Obviously not, otherwise he wouldn't have
been taken to court.

Did he accidently access these accounts, or was there intent.
According to the story, there was intent.

If Darren broke into a house, could he use the "bored" and
"curious" excuse ? No, he would probably go to jail.

Tresspass, whether onto physical or logical property is the same.

&gt; So, I think Darren should be treated with the same level of
&gt; respect as a striking train driver. He is not just a naughty
&gt; little boy who acted out of boredom, he did it for a reason,
&gt; and we should be allowed to know what those reasons are.
&gt; 
&gt; 

The action of striking is not against the law. Unauthorised
tresspass is.

What's even more surprising is that Darren was going to law
school. With a background in IT, you'd think he would be more
informed or interested in knowing what was legal or not when it
comes to "hacking" computer systems.

Of course, as most people on this list are from South Australia,
he effectively broke into each and everyone of our "homes". Why ?
Because we own the State Government, and it is our data that is
held on State Government systems. Do we know whether he violated
our privacy or not, by accessing are personal information ? Can
we be assured he didn't access our private information ? If he
did access our private information, what did he do with it, or
what is he going to do with it ?

Regards,
Mark.
