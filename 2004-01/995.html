Well not so much that I don't like it, I don't like the install pain I 
have seen others go through. I don't like arcane commands and I don't 
like to train the new user into jumping through hoops to get to where 
they want to go.

First and foremost I am a user and my niche is helping newcomers get 
into computing and especially get into open source.

The easier it is for them to not just install but to operate, the more 
satisfying their foray into open source will be.

Distros like Lycoris and Lindows are aimed very clearly at the desktop 
user and as such they achieve the aim of making the desktop look easy. 
Whether they make it look like windows or not isn't the real point, it 
is the experience they gain from using the distro that is important. 
Later they may notice that there are other worlds of Linux and the may 
navigate through those worlds. If they don't then from the user 
perspective they will still be happy in their easy to use non-windows 
world.

We need these users just as much as we need the command-line expert 
hacker. 

So do I like Debian? If it can give me a user interface that newbies 
can take to and happily click their way around then yes, I would like 
Debian. If others like Lycoris and Xandros and Lindows can put a coat 
of glossy paint over Debian and Linux and give the user a good 
experience then that is what I want to get used to so I can promote it 
and support it.

Does that help explain it?

BTW, hidden in the midst of that story is a coupon code that when 
entered at the Lindows order page will allow you to download their 
latest Lindows OS 4.5 Developer edition for free. The code will last 
till probably Friday US time so it may not work if you try it. I have 
my copy. I just need to burn it from the ISO. I am also going to 
download their LindowsOS LiveCD version. That version is freely 
available and free to distribute so others can try and see just what 
the Lindows scene is like. I am looking forward to it. I will still 
probably stay with SuSE - I have just FTP'd SuSE 9 but not installed it 
yet.

 Cheers,
 Ian
