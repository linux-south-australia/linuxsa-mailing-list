&gt; Why is it so hard to understand?  If I own a piece of property, I get
&gt;&gt; to decide who can lawfully access it -- That's what "owning" property
&gt;&gt; means.  Any access which I don't authorize is UNlawful access;  those
&gt;&gt; who unlawfully access my property should be prosecuted by the law.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Data is not property. Data is infinitely replicable, property isn't. 
&gt; This is the same misunderstanding that afflicts the RIAA and DMCA.


I'm not talking about the data, Steve.  I'm talking about the computer.
If I own a computer, surely I get to decide who can and can't have
access to it...?


&gt; The reasonable effort at security is to unplug your computer from the 
&gt; network. It's very easy and completely effective.

If that's the best you can do then you can stop now, because the law
doesn't agree with you.  It never has.

&gt; When you're plugged into the network, it's the same as being in a public 
&gt; place. People should be free to explore what is in public, and I 
&gt; certainly wouldn't be happy with trusting a bank that had not been 
&gt; thoroughly explored by a bevy of security experts AND amateurs.

That's total crap.  When you're plugged in to the network, parts that
you wish to make public are in a public space, and parts which you
wish to keep private are in a private space.

What's so magical about the TCP/IP Internet which makes it public,
while the TCP/IP network which feeds your banks automatic teller
machines is private?  The technology is no different;  The only
difference is that the bank makes sure you understand that you're
not welcome on their part of the network -- Even if you happen to
discover a poorly secured gateway which lets you onto it.

The idea that the Internet is one all-encompassing "public space" is
ludicrous.  It's a morass of public and private spaces, with barriers
between them, just like the real world.  And, just like the real world,
some of those barriers are permiable -- But they're still barriers,
and you're still not welcome on the "wrong" side of them.
