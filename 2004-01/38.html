&lt;quote who="David WOLVERTON"&gt;
&gt;&gt; Indeed.  We're also needing cameramen with own-supplied firewire
&gt;&gt; cameras to come to LCA to make this happen - you can be a helper, with
&gt;&gt; a discounted registration!
&gt;
&gt; PML...  Let me get this straight: You're actually asking for qualified
&gt; broadcast standard operators to come in with their own cameras and
&gt; *PAY* for the priveledge of *WORKING* through the conference?
&gt;
&gt; I think I can safely say after many years of accredited work broadcast
&gt; through OPTUS VISION, channels 2, 7, 9, 10 and even ACE - as well as
&gt; many hundreds of other hours working on un-broadcast projects where the
&gt; pjoject was either straight to to video screen(s) and/or to tape - as
&gt; everything ranging from a tech, to a camera operator to a director to a
&gt; producer - that you have no idea how funny this statement is when you
&gt; consider the value of what your asking for and then add to it the fact
&gt; that you want people to pay YOU to do it...  *UNBELIEVABLE*

David,


Linux.Conf.Au is a volunteer run event.  Lots of people are donating lots
of their time to make this happen.  Personally I've put in excess of 1000
hours into LCA2004 this year (in my spare time).

Just because you know how to point a camera doesn't make you any more
valuable or important as someone who normally contracts themselves out at
&gt; $100 / hour.  Same for a comparison between any 2 jobs.

Ryan was suggesting if someone would like to come to the conference at a
discounted rate, and they own and can point a DV camera, then approach
him.

We *could* pay professional rates for this sort of thing, and for all the
other specialist tasks that need doing, but then we'd be charging
$USD1,195 per head (see
<A HREF="http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/linuxworldny/V40/index.cvn?ID">http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/linuxworldny/V40/index.cvn?ID</A>=10127) for the
conference, not $AUS275 (for hobbyists).  *And* we've got better speakers
and a better conference! :-)
