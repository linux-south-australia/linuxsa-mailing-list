&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Think about photons
&gt; &gt; along the same lines as broadcast messages and walla.  
&gt; Someone that has
&gt; &gt; access to the sidewalk near this gate could easily listen 
&gt; to traffic that
&gt; &gt; the person who owns the gate is sending out, and again 
&gt; either analogy will
&gt; &gt; work (photons/messages). 
&gt; 
&gt; So, shining a torch at a gate latch at night (to generate reflected
&gt; photons for visual analysis) counts as what ?

ICMP and a flash light are conceptually the same to me because the photons
are being controlled just the sasme as ICMP is (:

&gt; What about if it is an MS-Wondergate that cant be broken into. If you
&gt; get caught trying to break into it, you will get slapped with 
&gt; a fine and
&gt; community service. However, if you own one, and you get caught taking
&gt; the latch mechanism apart, or worse, trying to sell a 
&gt; superior competing
&gt; product, then you get a massive lawsuit against you, and may 
&gt; well end up
&gt; in guantanimo bay, cuba, as a certified 'Enemy of Freedom(tm)'.
&gt; 
&gt; Burn it to the ground, I say !

I am not sure what category of belief I fall into but I do believe in "buyer
beware".  In the sense of if I buy something I take it upon myself to be
honest/responsible as to why I purchased it.  If I purchased it knowing full
well that I am going to use it in a way not intended (which includes quite a
number of possibilities) then being honest with myself I would know that I
could incur some sort of consequance (regardless of whether it is good or
bad) for it and therefore take that responsiblity.  I am not at all saying
that the penalties that currently exist for this type of scenario are the
correct penalties, but I think getting penalized for doing something that
you know isn't right is only fair.  Do I wish for a penalty everytime I
break the speed limit?  No I don't.  I just think that knowning the penalty
allows me to make a decision to either follow society (government) or not.
Also I don't think that most manufacturers (does a package of meat state
what it is for?) state on their product what the intended use is for, and
because of that then there should be no penalties.  I don't believe in the
statement of 'ignorance is no excuse'.
