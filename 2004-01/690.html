&gt;Okay here's the story;

&gt;*** Disclaimer: I've only found out about this stuff since he went and
&gt;buggered things up ***
&gt;
lol 

&gt;A friend of mine is installing SUSE 9.0 and wants a FAT32 partition to
&gt;share documents between Windoze and SUSE. Simple, right? Well he goes
&gt;and mounts the FAT32 partition as /home and has had no end of bother. I
&gt;assume this is because Linux tries to assign permissions to a partition
&gt;which it cannot do so to, yes?
that is not a sensible solution permissions or not.
(there are dists that work on FAT32 if he REALLY wants to do that.)

&gt;
&gt;Okay well he still wants that shared directory so I said, "Create the
&gt;partition and let SUSE pick it up and mount it onto your desktop as
&gt;/windows/C (or something like that)". Alternatively, if you wanted to
&gt;make the /home/[user] folder thing transparent with the FAT32 partition
&gt;(i.e., when he clicks on /home/[user], it opens his FAT32 documents),
&gt;symlink/home/[user] to wherever the FAT32 drive is mounted (although,
&gt;I'd prefer he didn't do this because I would imagine that you could
&gt;only control permissions to the /home directory and not subsequent
&gt;subdirectories).
&gt;
ah ha hmm.. 
&gt;So did I miss something? Is there a way to mount a FAT32 partition as
&gt;your/home directory or will the Linux folder permission thing just keep
&gt;getting in the way? I assume it will but I don't want to rule it out.
&gt;
If more than one user mount at /windowz or /home/windows or /mnt/windows
If just his good self then as you say mount at /home/user/windows

(assuming you have fstab set to vfat (or fat32 whatever fits his
windows file system. I believe you can even mount NT filesystems these
days ro )

In any case you should be able to sym link to the partitions
filetree from your desktop. I am not familiar with windows files
permissions but I have set ro  etc. successfully in similar
situations in the past....

BTW you could run his home directory on VFAT but as you can link to
anywhere on the doze file tree ...
