I'd just like to thank the following people for their efforts in making
Linux.Conf.Au 2004 rock.  It's always hard detailing a list, because you
always leave someone out, but I want to publicly say thank you to (at
least) these people.

The core organising team (the 'orange shirts') has basically been
together as a group since before LCA2003, and have been meeting most
Monday nights throughout the year to organise the event (some meetings
went longer than 6 hours!)  These guys have given up sleep, paid
employment, ignored their families, and never want to eat pizza again,
as a result of their involvement.  Thank you all - I really owe you guys
an awful lot - I couldn't ask to be part of a better team.

The following group of people have made significant contributions, in
one way or another, to LCA2004.  This might have been running a
miniconf, publicising the event, setting up the registration desk at
6:30am everyday, giving advice, manning a registration desk, getting
coffee, getting bugged for wearing a yellow t-shirt, or or doing things
that I didn't even notice.  All very important, and without you all the
conference wouldn't have worked.

for charity, and thank you for making it all fun to organise.

See you all in Canberra next year! :-)  They've already said they're
going to top Adelaide - so you'd better not miss it!
