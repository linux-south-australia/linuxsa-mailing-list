Howdy,

I've had a huge problem for months, and I've never thought once of
asking here.  Hell, if you guys can't answer it, nobody can, so here
goes...

I moved around 3-4 months ago to a place in Athelstone.  Great place, no
complaints at all, but the Internet here stinks.  8-14K dialup connects,
and I believe I'm on a pair gain + rim (but Telstra are hopeless and
won't really tell me anything).  When you're sharing the net, it's
truly, truly awful (Google, for example, usually takes 20 seconds to
load).

I do an incredible amount of remote administration/development via ssh,
so it's important I have a low latency connection.  I share the Internet
with my girlfriend, who does visit a fair few webpages, so the Internet
solution needs to be able to cope with this kind of usage whilst still
providing low latency (I'm happy to implement shaping/QoS).  Dialup at
these speeds is awful - really, it's truly awful (I said that before,
didn't I?).  I'm talking ~30 second lag in ssh on average.  As much as
I'd love ADSL with a high download cap, I can't get it.

Telstra won't improve the phone line service, being their usual helpful
'selves.  I can't get any of the DSL services.  I can't get cable.  I
can't get wireless as I'm both in a kind of valley, and around the back
of a hill, and I've already tried asking any houses in line of sight to
me if they can get DSL/Cable, but they're in the same boat.  It seems I
can't get ISDN either.

One-way sattelite is out of the question as latency is terrible (uplink
is still through a modem, downlink is usually in the US).

Any ideas, apart from moving (which isn't a current option)?  I'm
completely out of options, sadly, and I'm slowly going crazy. :-(
