Rubbish.  There are lots of meatspaces.  There is the meatspace in
the town square, which is treated in a certain way by the law.  There's
the meatspace in my front yard, which is treated a different way by the
law.  There's the meatspace in my back yard, which is treated
differently again.  And there's the meatspace in my living room, which
is still different, and in my bedroom, which is even more different.

There are lots of meatspaces.  And lots of laws to cover it in lots of
different ways.

You've picked the one bit of space and the one bit of law which you
like, and said, "Let's treat the entire Internet like this, regardless
of what the owners of the machines which make up the Internet want."

You think the Internet is a public square.

I don't.

And neither does anyone, anywhere in the world, who has ever written any
law whatsoever about computers and networks.
