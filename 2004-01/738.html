Your personal details should not be kept online in an accessible 
fashion. The fact that many companies do so are multiple disasters 
waiting to happen... and plenty of them have.

&gt;&gt; When you're plugged into the network, it's the same as being in a
&gt;&gt; public place. People should be free to explore what is in public
&gt;
&gt; My employers (SA Police) are plugged into a network. Surely you're not
&gt; advocating that information contained therein is for public 
&gt; consumption.

I'm advocating that much of the information that may be kept on the 
police network should NOT be plugged into the Internet.

The information about your investigations and other critical private 
information should be kept entirely separate, on different computers, 
on different networks, with no physical connection to the Internet 
whatsoever.

&gt; Unmitigated disaster comes readily to mind.

Exactly. And no amount of talking about it is going to change the 
physical reality of how your computers and networks are physically 
configured. You might be able to get me to agree with your viewpoints 
if you're really really eloquent and persuasive, but what about the 
people who aren't?

We're exchanging keystrokes and noise here... what's physically 
possible is always going to be the ultimate arbiter.

&gt; "No, no, I didn't look at the files showing that I'm being targeted by 
&gt; the
&gt; Child Exploitation Unit at all. I was just testing your security for 
&gt; your
&gt; own benefit."

Who really is to blame there? A criminal, who by definition is a 
criminal?

Or the police for being stupid enough to provide the connection to 
sensitive data?
