Hi David

I've noticed people are talking about your Billion as a possible 
security problem.

Ok, even if the Billion IS the problem, they have to get through that 
AND Windows XP.

So: (here is what i would do)
 Presuming they DID get thru the Billion easily, then they have to get 
through Windows XP.
 Two ways to do this:
    1. Vulnerability in the OS
    2. Trojan/Virus/Malicious program on WinXP letting them connect.

I would initial suspect a Trojan/Malicious program - these are probably 
a lot easier to use than an OS vulnerability (depending on how 
up-to-date your Windows install is). There are plenty of the so called 
'Back Door' programs out there (e.g. Back Orifice).

However, you may as well fix both these possible problems:
  - Running Windows Update should take care of OS vulnerabilities and 
running an updated virus scanner should get rid of Trojans...


After i had done that, i would start looking at my Billion or the 
possibility of installing another firewall..

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;  
&gt; Someone from our group (I'm not going to mention any names yet as I'm 
&gt; waiting to find out if they've got a good/legitimate reason) just 
&gt; E-Mailed me a copy of everything on my desktop; in a ZIP file.
&gt;  
&gt; Now assuming the best (that this persons had no idea about this 
&gt; because their PC was somehow commandeered without their knowledge) 
&gt; this still leaves me with the problem that I have a permenant ADSL 
&gt; 1.5mbit connection, behind a firewall that obviously isn't 
&gt; working/configured properly...  (Quite a dangerous condition I'm sure 
&gt; we'd all agree)
&gt;  
&gt; Now...  My limited understanding/skill lead me to believe that ALL 
&gt; ports are closed - and I honestly beleived that this shouldn't have 
&gt; been able to happen...  That said, it obviously DID happen/could 
&gt; happen again - and I honestly just don't have the skill/ability to 
&gt; figgure out what's missconfigured and close it off.  (I'm only a 
&gt; wannabe Geek)
&gt;  
&gt; That said, it occurs to me that because some of you guys ARE the 
&gt; best/brightest that Australia has to offer - I should
&gt; ask if someone is willing to take half an hour or so to help me 
&gt; out...  So here's my request: I'm willing to pay anyone with the 
&gt; appropriate skill level to come over and have a look at my firewall so 
&gt; they can help me inhibit anyone but the most skillful/determined of 
&gt; hackers doing this sort of thing again.
&gt;  
&gt; My OS is: WIndows XP
&gt; My Modem is: Billion
&gt; My ADSL is: Internode
&gt; My Suburb is: Highbury
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;
