&gt;If that were the case, we could definitely agree that 
&gt;Micro$hizenhou$sen as a collective had lost their minds.

Don't take this personally, but I don't know that paying out M$ 
is terribly constructive (much as it is one of my favorite pastimes too ;).


The reality is that MS do make some really really good products, but 
the unfortunate downside to that reality is that their really really good 
products only work really really well with other really really good MS
products.

This is one of the major selling strengths of open source, ie: the lack
of vendor lock in and the fact that you can drive your own ICT destiny
rather than following a particular vendors endless upgrade cycle.

One point was made very well by Con Zymaris in his presentation at the
OSiG conference early last week.  The cost of changing your technology
when your business requirements change isn't factored into the purchase
process.  If one is "locked in" to a vendor then this cost of change is 
usually astronomical because you need to change both the underlying 
technology as well as the software.  (case in point, SAG's reliance on
Exchange as their messaging platform)

I could go on, but I have lots of work to do using my less than wonderful, 
non-standards compliant desktop environment :P
