&gt; that'd be a great idea, if only i could carry as much just stuff 
&gt; on my bike as i could in my car! hmmm... i didn't see any decent 
&gt; place to lock up a bike around the HP building ... so would they 
&gt; let you bring you bike inside/upstairs?

My paniers hold about 10kg either side. 

Over the course of a year you save hours of "looking for parking" time.

Then there is all the dead time you spend just plain driving places
and not even getting any exercise along the way. What a total waste of
time that is. 

Then, as you get older, there's all the time you save by not running
round looking for cheap viagra because your circulatory system isn't
all clogged up (seriously, the small blood vessels in the penis are the
first to get clogged - hence the hight rates of erection problems in
older men --- especially among big meat eaters). 

etc. etc. 

Cheers,
Geoff Russell

P.S. This post is about as much on topic as many others lately ;-)
