James Turner wrote an interesting article and presents some good
arguments, but makes an assumption which I don't agree with.
Follow me....

Too many developers do 'scratch the same itch', and as a result we do have
a confusing plethora of choices for the same function.  Sometimes that
gives choice, which is good, and that's a rationale with which we're
all familiar and probably even agree.  But sometimes it's not so good.
James's example of sound systems is a classic case of not so good.
A lot of software only works with one type of sound system, and when
your hardware is only supported on a different sound system, you've got
a problem.  Fortunately I sense that all other sound systems are going
away in favour of ALSA.  Maybe what we've seen is evolution at work.

It's also true that Open source developer love a good feud.  Hell,
unix people have been feuding ever since Berkeley started rolling
their own releases.  There's really nothing we like to argue more than
my religion is better than yours, be that editors, flavour of unix,
programming language of choice, and so on.  In fact, back in the 80's
we were so busy fighting amongst ourselves that we failed to notice
that the year of unix was coming until it had already passed us by.
The year of unix never actually came, because unix was just too hard
for the market.  We had the year of Windows instead.  Pity about that.

And it is true, too, that we don't take criticism well.  I sure don't*.
It bugs the hell out of me when some total newb idiot hints that I might
have been less than optimal and suggests a possibility of an improvement.
If they're so smart how come they aren't finding faults with their
own code?  Turkeys.

Obviously we have a chip on our collective shoulders with regard to
Microsoft, and SCO have just joined them, but that's because Microsoft
and SCO really are out to get us.  To be fair, we're out to get them,
too, but that's because we're better, free, and available in source.
We've been held hostage by them for too long and now that a light has
been turned on at the end of the tunnel it's only natural that we should
stampede over them to regain control of our own destinies.

But the assumption that James makes, actually I think he infered it,
is evident from his comment that, "[Windows users'] have to be told why
Linux is better (and it really has to be better for them), not just why
Windows is trash."  For those that missed it, the assumption is that
we want people to convert from Windows to unix.  I disagree.  I don't
want them to.  I don't care if they do, in fact I'm almost filled with
apathy at the notion.  Let them come if they want to, but let us not
make ourselves into the image of our enemy just to seduce our enemies
supporters into switching camps.  Let's not forget our heritage, the
wonderful, elegant, powerful one-liner commands that we used to compose
for what is otherwise difficult on other platforms.  Forgoe the GUI if
it means forgoing the power of unix (and it usually does.)  If the
Windows users don't get us, let that be their problem, not ours.
