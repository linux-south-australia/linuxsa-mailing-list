same story here

&gt; What a shambles that event made of that part of the city.

the event organisers just seem to ignore parking these days,
and there is just not enough parking in the city after 6pm...

&gt; The presentation was interesting (same as what was given by Anand at 
&gt; LCA).

I think the best thing that came out of the talk,
was that the installer will be simpler without
losing any of its usfulness.

So if you have anything thats a little to tricky for
the main install environment you can build a uDeb to
do the dirty work and present that clean interface to 
the user without having to compromise that clean shiny
text interface =)

cheers,

Kim
