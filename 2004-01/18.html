Once upon a time Gary Idler tapped upon the keyboard...

&gt; It's supply and demand, simple economics :-|
&gt; If prices were $10 you couldn't hold a conference like
&gt; this, there would be too much interest. 

I'm not sure where what I'm about to write fits in to this
discussion, but it's vaguely related to the above quote.

I was part of the organising collective for the 2003 Students of
Sustainability conference (and the 2004 one now, too), held at
Flinders University (sort of) back in July.

Anyway, we did this awesome, intense, 5/6 day conference of about
500 people.

Registration costs were $120 unwaged and $150 waged (and we did not
require presentation of concession cards etc), and people could
apply for further concessions if they needed it.

The registration fee was inclusive of campground accommodation and
all meals. Some field trips were extra.

Here's the budget:
================================================================
SOS 2002 Seed grant                     	$12,000.00
USASA Donation                          	 $5,000.00
Project Aware Grant                     	 $2,500.00
Dept for Env/Heritage                   	 $5,000.00
Community Development Grant - City of Mitcham	   $800.00
Donation from NUS SA                        	   $600.00
Australian Volunteers Donation              	   $400.00
Registrations	                                $58,947.21
AUSAID	                                         $6,041.00
TOTAL  RECEIVED INCOME	                        $91,288.21
	
EXPENDITURE	
Catering					$45,483.79
Printing					$2,805.00
Transport					$3,194.94
Postage						$1,574.82
Entertainment Costs				$2,470.00
Stationery/Art Expenses 			$1,149.65
Equipment Hire/Room Hire			$8,794.96
Seed Grant 2004					$12,000.00
Miscellaneous Cost				$2,664.25
Outstanding Invoices (as advised by collective member)	$1,500.00
Repayment to AUSAID				$2,400.00
	
TOTAL ACTUAL EXPENDITURE	$84,037.41
	
Surplus/Deficit	$7,250.80
================================================================

I'm sure a $10-$20 lca fringe conf could be done if people put their
minds to it.

If anyone wants to know more about what the 2003 conference was,
there's a link to the archived wiki on the home page of the 2004
conference (to be held in Melbourne):
