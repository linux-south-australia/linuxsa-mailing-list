&gt; So - for a theory - discovering a public ISP URL that allows me

&gt; and then notify you of it means I am liable for prosecution???  Even 
&gt; if I could or did copy credit card data for all the organisation's 
&gt; clients, which I could do because it is publicly available 
&gt; information, is that illegal because a careless sysadmin has rendered 
&gt; it publicly available?  (gee I thought they were timestamps - LOL).  
&gt; If I add a root user to see if it works, is this also illegal?  No 
&gt; it's not.

It is illegal.

&gt; If I do a search and one of the links opens up a pile of kiddie pr0n 
&gt; sites - which are illegal images to download in Australia - can I be 
&gt; prosecuted?  No I can not IMHO - there is no intent.

You can be prosecuted.

&gt; That's laughable.  There is no intent there at all, no damage done and 
&gt; could not be prosecuted IMHO.  Try to prove "wilfully and knowingly 
&gt; committing a crime" - you'll have a hard time doing it.  If something 
&gt; is open without any "keep out" signs there is no problems with people 
&gt; taking a look.  If a sysadmin leaves a gaping hole then people are 
&gt; entitled to walk through it, especially if that hole is publicly 
&gt; available.  Sysadmins can't hide behind the law for poor workmanship.

I agree... it is laughable, but unfortunately that's the way it is. 
That's why I have problems with the current situation.

I do not understand how Mark Newton and others can defend this.
