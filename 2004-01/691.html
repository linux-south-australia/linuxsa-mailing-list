&gt; &gt;Okay here's the story;

&gt; &gt;*** Disclaimer: I've only found out about this stuff since he went and

&gt; lol
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;A friend of mine is installing SUSE 9.0 and wants a FAT32 partition to
&gt; &gt;share documents between Windoze and SUSE. Simple, right? Well he goes
&gt; &gt;and mounts the FAT32 partition as /home and has had no end of bother. I
&gt; &gt;assume this is because Linux tries to assign permissions to a partition
&gt; &gt;which it cannot do so to, yes?
&gt; that is not a sensible solution permissions or not.
&gt; (there are dists that work on FAT32 if he REALLY wants to do that.)

Ugh, indeed.  Permissions are going to go right out the window, which is what /home is all 
about.  This is not a solution at all.

If he wants to share documents, just mount the windows partition under /mnt/c or something, 
and symlink ~/Documents to /mnt/c/Documents\ And\ Settings/Username/My\ Documents.  
Then just tell him when he wants to use his documents, go to home, go to Documents, and 
wha'la.

If he's one of these users that's going to whine that it isn't exactly like Windows, tell him that it's 
a good thing :-)  What baffles me is people, when wanting to try an alternative desktop, expect 
things to happen in the exact manner that it happens under their previous desktop - you tell 
me, what's alternative about it then? :-)

&gt; If more than one user mount at /windowz or /home/windows or /mnt/windows
&gt; If just his good self then as you say mount at /home/user/windows
&gt; 
&gt; (assuming you have fstab set to vfat (or fat32 whatever fits his
&gt; windows file system. I believe you can even mount NT filesystems 
&gt; these days ro )

You can, but usually as read only - writing is deemed dangerous, I've seen it corrupt partitions 
before, so beware :-)

&gt; In any case you should be able to sym link to the partitions
&gt; filetree from your desktop. I am not familiar with windows files
&gt; permissions but I have set ro  etc. successfully in similar
&gt; situations in the past....

Nod, you can do this.
 
&gt; BTW you could run his home directory on VFAT but as you can link to
&gt; anywhere on the doze file tree ...

You could do this too, but permissions go right out the window, and there's things that do check 
ownerships and such that will probably fall over.  Not recommended.
