But how do we get Linus to the fish market?

How about if we convince a book store to pay him to do a book
signing. Then we get 600 conf attendees to descend on the mall
outside Dymocks and shout "We want Guy. We want Guy." That
should attract several thousand screaming teenage girls and the 
riot squad. We explain later that they were screaming "We want 
that guy" and really freak him out.

Or perhaps we could ring the Premiers office and tell them the
"Leader of the Free World" might be making a surpise visit and 
to get ready with the state reception ;-)

Or we could just dress him up in a penguin outfit and have
several hundred tshirt wearing geeks laugh at him. Hmmm, that 
gets my vote.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Something I didn't know? Linus is jumping on a plane to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oz!
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gee, I wonder what he's going to be doing.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Everyone, remember to act surprised!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; When Linus was at the AUUG conference, a few years ago, he
&gt; said he didn't feel famous because he was only recognised in
&gt; computer conferences. He said he'd feel famous when he was
&gt; recognised in a fish market.
&gt; 
&gt; I propose we hold a happening.  I'd like as many people as
&gt; can be roped in, to go to the fish market at a time when we
&gt; know Linus will be there, approach him, greet him by name,
&gt; and leave.
