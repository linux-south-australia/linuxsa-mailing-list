I am new to instaling a Linux OS and Clark Connect iso
Having read much the past 6 months or so, and now attempting to get 
practical, along the way, i realy did not understand much of what I have 
read.
But I want to get away from MS and this where I feel am "comfort zoned" 
to start.
Many have given up, emailing me with their version of "helps", and 
seemingly it's become a bit of a joke.
But I neeed my firewall. I have dabdled with CC and it is what I have 
chosen to "insure" my home network.
I would gladly pay someonme to just do it, in a way I save time.
It's been since sunday I have tried to get something to work, only to go 
half way thru the install, and when the "check CD integrity" section 
comes on the screen, it fails due to a corrupt CD.
Well, I burnt now the 7th iso, after trial and error, at first the 
"burn" of the iso was wrong, XP pro needs another bit of 3rd party 
software to do the job correctly. I was not aware of this at first.

Now, I had to download the Clark Connect iso image again, and this took 
another 4 hours.
I suspected it was corrupt in the first place.

Having read the instructions on your web page, 
<A HREF="http://www.md5summer.org/help.html">http://www.md5summer.org/help.html</A>
I have specific questions this time, as to how to do it.
To some, it may seem a simple task, but for others like me that just 
don't seem to get a grasp of it by reading, until the practical is done 
right first, then what we read, all of a sudden it makes sense !
So, here we go

1. Clark Connect iso is now in folder of XP Pro C:/root 
folder/clarkconnect-2.1
Note: the folder name is exactly as I have named it, having read your 
help files first.
When I did the download of the iso image, it went directly to *that* folder.

2. QUESTION: At this point, do I now burn the iso image on CD, *then* 
MD5 while it is on CD ?
    ANSWER 1: Burn iso to CD first, then MD5 ?
    ANSWER 2: MD5 iso before burning to CD in current folder ?
     YOUR ANSWER:

3. QUESTION: Do I extract the MD5 software into the same folder as the 
image ?
    YOUR ANSWER:

4  QUESTION: <A HREF="http://clarkconnect.org/download/home.current.html">http://clarkconnect.org/download/home.current.html</A>
                          *MD5:* 277f54f9c51e445e1d4928b7ea4ecc92
                          *Size:* 381 MB

                           Where/how do I utilize the MD5 number on CC 
download web page ?
                             Is it a file in txt ? Is it already in the 
iso ?
   YOUR ANSWER:


This is all I have for now, I hope this is seen as feedback, from a 
perspective of PC users that are migrating away from MS products and 
desperately need to communicate that most just do not understand the 
help instructions at this stage.
This is no one's fault, but a glitch that can be corrected, by assuming 
we do not realy know it all, and some learn by doing, then the reading 
makes sense.

Your help in this matter would be much appreciated

Regards

Pete
