&gt; Just been given an old laptop (thanks Shaun) and I need to put a
&gt; version of Linux on it.
&gt;
&gt; It is a Packard Bell Statesman plus. I think it is in the 200C series
&gt; model 810415. It has 7.4 M of ram (I think one of the chips is U/S), a
&gt; Cyrix 486 CPU and a Seagate 200 M hard drive. It has a floppy drive, 16
&gt; bit PCMCIA slot plus connectors for PS2, LPT, 15 pin VGA (outputs to
&gt; the CTR in colour - neat) and 9 pin COM port.
&gt;
&gt; Firstly I need to get it on the network so I can store the current OS
&gt; images in case I need to recover them one day. Then find a way to
&gt; install a distro of some kind.

You'll need a 16-bit PCMCIA network card - not 32-bit cardbus, which 
although /may/ fit, won't work.

&gt; I was thinking of Morphix or something like that which has been
&gt; optimised for the low-spec machine. With such low ram (and max has been
&gt; fitted) chances are that most downloadable packages will be too much
&gt; for installing on this little beast.
&gt;
&gt; I have discussed this with several at LCA including some of the greats.
&gt; No wonder Linus signed it with "Good Luck" and Bdale signed it with a
&gt; Debian symbol suggesting that it was probably the only thing from
&gt; Debian I would be able to get on it. Somebody has a photo of the
&gt; signing ceremony, would love a copy of it please.

Heh, Linus signed 'the goat' too :-)

&gt; Any suggestions on which distro and how to install it?

Debian should install on it, I think :-)

That said though, there are many distros around the place designed for 
older machines.

R

&gt; BTW, I have the Xircom PE3 Printer port to Ethernet adapter if that
&gt; gives somebody ideas on how to do the extraction and install.
&gt; I cant get it to work under the version of WFW3.11 that is still on the
&gt; machine (but not for too long).
&gt;  Cheers,
&gt;  Ian
