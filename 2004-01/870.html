&gt; &gt; if I follow the steps of mounting /home to a new partition
&gt; &gt; what happens to
&gt; &gt; the old space?
&gt; The old space still exists but depending on whether you use 
&gt; `mv` command or
&gt; the `cp` command to move the contents of the old device to 
&gt; the new device
&gt; will determine if the data is still there as well as the new place.
&gt; well there wasnt much data my concern is since I redirected 
&gt; the path to
&gt; somewhere else will the space not being used anymore be 
&gt; availble to the
&gt; system on HDA1 - I guess it should be but I wasn't sure.

I actually used to do this quite alot when I was building my home "lab" so
to speak and I found that the most common thing I was doing over and over
was dealing with software configuration issues among others of course.  For
instance I would move say /home to /1 (bad naming perhaps but it is my brain
:) and then when I logged in of course it was pointing to /home which well
nothing existed anymore.  So what I came up with was a very simple solution
of `ln -s /1 /home`.  I wouldn't have done this for work but I can easily
say it was acceptable to me at home.  I start getting lazy by using the bash
shell's '~' for my home directoy and forget that most apps I use don't
understand the '~' until they start complaining.
