Hi folks,

today while attending our City of Salisbury Australia Day Awards I met 
up with representatives of the Laotian community who have a community 
centre a few streets away in Salisbury North. I offered them help with 
a loan of a computer through SNNN and also help with Operating Systems 
and software in their own language.

I have researched and found a version of Linux is available for them. I 
have still to get around to chasing up the availability of software.

1. Any suggestions on software that might be suitable.
2. Any good sites that might help them settle in and start researching 
and making contact with those still in Laos or those who might have 
emigrated to other countries? 
3. I was really impressed with the work at <A HREF="http://www.jhai.org">http://www.jhai.org</A>
 - a battery powered computer running on about 12 watts that is topped 
up by somebody pedalling on a bike operating a generator. And 
connecting through a WiFi link from treetop to water tower over to the 
nearest big town about 10k away.

Any other sites like that?

Oh, and anybody want to work with them to teach them how to use Linux 
in their own language?

 Cheers,
 Ian
