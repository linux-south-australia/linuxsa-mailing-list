Hi Andrew,

If you want to set this PC up as an ethernet bridge, only one Interface 
needs an IP address. The other will simply bridge packets to the single 
IP. It's never a great idea to have more than one interface in the same 
subnet, as the routing tables for most OS's only allow one 
best-destination per route.

169.254.0.0 is defined in 

<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/00dec/I-D/draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-01.txt">http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/00dec/I-D/draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-01.txt</A>

This is used for a host to give itself an IP address when there is not 
one configured on an interface and no DHCP server can be found. Often 
you'll see it as the address on Windows PC's that can't connect to a Lan.

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;    I am having a frustrating time getting a new server up and going. The
&gt;problem seems to be strange entries in the routing table that are being
&gt;automagically set, but I cannot identify from where, since I cannot find any
&gt;config file that would be automagically loaded.
&gt;
&gt;    The server is a PII 266 with 64Mb RAM (I know - processing overkill and
&gt;memory starved, but it is only temporary). I have two 10/100 PCI Ethernet
&gt;cards, both RT8139 based (they were identical cards, but in the interests of
&gt;frustration, I lashed out and bought a different one to try and solve the
&gt;problem). These connect to a network switch and an ADSL router.
&gt;
&gt;    The software is a minimal install RH 9.0 (OK so I know RH better than
&gt;any distro, it may not be the best, but I know it or thought I did). The
&gt;installation went fine, and both network cards were correctly detected, and
&gt;configured for a /28 subnet as follows:
&gt;
&gt;    eth0    203.*.*.162 mask 255.255.255.240 bcast 203.*.*.175
&gt;    eth1    203.*.*.163 mask 255.255.255.240 bcast 203.*.*.175
&gt;
&gt;the idea being, 162 connects to the ADSL modem configured as 161, and 163
&gt;being connected to the network switch and the box acting as a firewall
&gt;webserver.
&gt;
&gt;ifconfig eth0 & eth1 both return the correct configuration and both cards
&gt;are at different addresses and irqs so no conflicts there.
&gt;
&gt;Other config files are as such:
&gt;
&gt;/etc/sysconfig/network
&gt;    NETWORKING=yes
&gt;    FORWARD_IPV4=yes
&gt;    HOSTNAME=machine.mydomain.com.au
&gt;    GATEWAY=203.*.*.161
&gt;
&gt;/etc/sysctl.conf
&gt;    net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
&gt;    net.ipv4.ip_always_defrag=1
&gt;
&gt;Now the frustrating part. I can ping both interfaces and the home network
&gt;from the firewall as I should be able to do. I can ssh into 162 ONLY which
&gt;is partially correct as the bridge is not yet set up, but I CANNOT ssh into
&gt;163. I have tried network cable swaps but to no avail. I have looked at the
&gt;default routing table set up by the machine, and there are some strange
&gt;entries I don't understand:
&gt;
&gt;route -n
&gt;
&gt;Dest                    Gateway        Genmask        Flags    Metric    REF
&gt;USE
&gt;203.*.*.160        0.0.0.0     255.255.255.240    U        0            0
&gt;0        eth1
&gt;203.*.*.160        0.0.0.0     255.255.255.240    U        0            0
&gt;0        eth1
&gt;169.254.0.0        0.0.0.0     255.255.0.0            U        0
&gt;0        0        eth1
&gt;127.0.0.0            0.0.0.0     255.0.0.0                U        0
&gt;0        0        lo
&gt;0.0.0.0        203.*.*.161     0.0.0.0                    UG     0
&gt;0        0        eth1
&gt;
&gt;As you can see, there are two things that jump right out: where is eth0
&gt;interface that is correctly set up elsewhere?, and where did 169.254.0.0
&gt;come from? What is stranger is that when I manually delete everything except
&gt;lo and create the correct entries and interfaces, eth0 still dissapears. The
&gt;routing table I was expecting should look something like this:
&gt;
&gt;Dest                    Gateway        Genmask        Flags    Metric    REF
&gt;USE
&gt;203.*.*.162        0.0.0.0     255.255.255.240    U        0            0
&gt;0        eth0
&gt;203.*.*.163        0.0.0.0     255.255.255.240    U        0            0
&gt;0        eth1
&gt;127.0.0.0            0.0.0.0     255.0.0.0                U        0
&gt;0        0        lo
&gt;0.0.0.0        203.*.*.161     0.0.0.0                    UG     0
&gt;0        0        eth0
&gt;
&gt;when I hook up the bridge, 162 and 163 should dissapear and be replaced by:
&gt;
&gt;203.*.*.162        0.0.0.0     255.255.255.240    U        0            0
&gt;0        br0
&gt;
&gt;OK, what I need help with is, where are the config files that would produce
&gt;the broken routing table, or how do I fix it. I know RH 7.2 has specific
&gt;files that set up the routing table in /etc/sysconfig, but RH 9 doesn't seem
&gt;to have this file.
&gt;
&gt;    I have been stewing over this a week now and just CANNOT get it going. I
&gt;have RTFMed all sorts of FMs, but still no joy. Your help would be greatly
&gt;appreciated.
&gt;    TIA,
&gt;        Cheers!
&gt;            Andrew
