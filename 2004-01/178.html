&gt; &gt; Rather than fork out for an expensive modem (since it'll only be for
&gt; &gt; work once I get ADSL going), I downloaded the 14k-limited driver
&gt; &gt; from Linuxant. It worked! And while it did indeed seem to enforce an
&gt; &gt; *average* limit of 14k bps (I did a whole pile of downloads and
&gt; &gt; averaged 1500 bytes/s), this was in fact faster than the same set of
&gt; &gt; downloads in Windows on my supposedly 45k bps line. So I suspect I
&gt; &gt; have a crummy throughput with my ISP (well it is only $1/hour with Big
&gt; &gt; Button), so I might as well stick with the (free) 14k bps limited
&gt; &gt; version. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now that you have tried the 14k version, and discovered that it works to
&gt; your satisfaction, I urge you to spend US$14.95 and buy Linuxant's 56k
&gt; version.  Absent a revenue stream, Linuxant will be unable to continue
&gt; development of Linux drivers.  If we don't give them a modest sum for
&gt; their efforts, we will suffer in the future from lack of supported
&gt; devices.
&gt; 
&gt; It's only about $10 bucks, which is nothing for a business.

Well, probably more like $20, but the same is true.

However, I also downloaded the Linuxant drivers for my Laptop, which has 
an ALi AC-97 codec mumble in it, and the Linuxant drivers worked, but 
then, so did the slmodem or whatever code that I down loaded as well. It 
seems to be basically some sort of Intel 537 ...
