&gt; &gt; &gt; Just been given an old laptop (thanks Shaun) and I need to put a
&gt; &gt; &gt; version of Linux on it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is a Packard Bell Statesman plus. I think it is in the 200C series
&gt; &gt; &gt; model 810415. It has 7.4 M of ram (I think one of the chips is U/S), a
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cyrix 486 CPU and a Seagate 200 M hard drive. It has a floppy drive, 16
&gt; &gt; &gt; bit PCMCIA slot plus connectors for PS2, LPT, 15 pin VGA (outputs to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the CTR in colour - neat) and 9 pin COM port.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Firstly I need to get it on the network so I can store the current OS
&gt; &gt; &gt; images in case I need to recover them one day. Then find a way to
&gt; &gt; &gt; install a distro of some kind.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You'll need a 16-bit PCMCIA network card - not 32-bit cardbus, which 
&gt; &gt; although /may/ fit, won't work.

I have an old silver wavelan 16bit card that is supported by the 
wireless-tools from deb 3.0 2.4 CD. i have no wired nics though =(

&gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking of Morphix or something like that which has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; optimised for the low-spec machine. With such low ram (and max has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; fitted) chances are that most downloadable packages will be too much
&gt; &gt; &gt; for installing on this little beast.

pop the disk out and install on a more hefty PC then put it back in =)

in fact Ian, if you are coming this eve to the LinuxSA meet bring it
along, I have all the bits on me to do this...

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have discussed this with several at LCA including some of the greats.
&gt; &gt; &gt; No wonder Linus signed it with "Good Luck" and Bdale signed it with a
&gt; &gt; &gt; Debian symbol suggesting that it was probably the only thing from
&gt; &gt; &gt; Debian I would be able to get on it. Somebody has a photo of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; signing ceremony, would love a copy of it please.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Heh, Linus signed 'the goat' too :-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any suggestions on which distro and how to install it?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Debian should install on it, I think :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Possibly, but not highly likely. You'll find that slackware probably
&gt; won't either. Many general purpose Linux distributions have a tendency
&gt; to use a reasonable sized ramdisk and quite a generic kernel. You'll
&gt; often end up having trouble on machines with less than 12MB or 16MB of
&gt; RAM.

debian does need at least 16MB to install. tried this on another system
over the weekend. slackware needs 12MB also IIRR =(

&gt; What are you planning on running on the laptop? 

its an electric-notepad and electric-mail ...

&gt; On a machine with that little hardware, I'd build my own. 

i've done a similar thing on debian for my P75 wireless router =)

&gt; It sounds like a danting task, but if you know a bit about how your
&gt; operating system works, you should be fine. 

well, he will by the end of the process =)

&gt; There's a replacement for glibc called uclibc
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.uclibc.org/">http://www.uclibc.org/</A>), which is designed to be quite small. This
&gt; coupled with busybox and friends (<A HREF="http://www.busybox.net/">http://www.busybox.net/</A>), you'll have
&gt; a fairly standard-looking linux command line (with a few notable
&gt; omissions) in a few MB at most. It'd only take 20 minutes on a fairly
&gt; average machine to compile the two from source and a bit longer to
&gt; transfer it onto the box (or less if you stick the laptop HDD in your PC
&gt; temporarily).
&gt; 
&gt; It's possible to compile XFree86 4.3.0 to use the Linux Vesa Framebuffer
&gt; kernel driver. Compiled, it's around 700kB and is suitable for remote X
&gt; connections, etc. You can run local X applications, but you'll need to
&gt; build library dependencies against uclibc, etc, etc. This is where it
&gt; starts to get a little time consuming.

yes, but it may well be worth it. i was talking to someone at LCA about
a low memory set of packages on debian, (but can't remember thier name)
using FLWM or FVWM... and a low memory python ..

&gt; Or you could install NetBSD or OpenBSD. Both of which seem happy to
&gt; install/run on a machine with that little RAM and disk. NetBSD in
&gt; particular happily installed on my MIPS DECStation, which is a 20MHz
&gt; MIPS-based box with 8MB RAM and 200MB of hard disk space. It used to run
&gt; Ultrix, but I fixed that :-)

nice =) i've been fiddling with NetBSD and Debian on my Sparc 5's =)
one notices bloat very quickly on less than 32MB ram and 100MHz cpu ;)
 
cheers,

Kim
