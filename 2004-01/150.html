G'day Peter,
Lucent modems based on the "Venus" chipset are hardware modems.
Other chipsets from Lucent such as the "Mercury" are software modems.

The PCI version of the Venus chipset merely is seen as a com port with 
interrupt &gt;10 & i/o address in xxxx hex range, (i.e. not 2f8 like com2).

The chip is extremely flexible, coming in a few packages, supporting:
ISA
PCI
USB
PCMCIA

The package the modem manufacture uses would depend mainly on the 
interface they wish to support.

Linux support for software modems is pretty good, as other people have 
mentioned, so using an internal software modem isn't really a problem 
these days, as long as you have a P200MHz or so processor, (remember 
those...).

I'd suggest using one of these as they are cheap, reliable & common.

You'll have to do your homework to ensure you can get drivers, (lots of 
other folks have suggested how to identify the modem precisely & where 
to get drivers).

External softmodems are usually USB. You can get external hard USB 
modems, but they are rare & expensive. You've really got to look at 
specifics like do they use the Lucent "Venus" chipset.

Internal modems provide a neat, cheap solution but are a minefield to 
setup. External serial port modems are usually a doddle.

Corey Taylor correctly summarized the situation:

"In my experience, hard internal modems are near impossible to find anymore.
Hard externals are still everywhere and both internal and external softs 
are everywhere.I myself use a hard external modem (Swansmart Turbo II) 
and it's had zero trouble being picked up in every linux distro and Unix 
I've tried (RH7.3, 8, 9, Mdk 9.1, Gentoo 1.4, Debian Woody, Slack 9.0, 
9.1, FreeBSD 5.1, Knoppix 3.2, Vector Linux SOHO 3.2).
I did have trouble in Gentoo until I realised that I'd forgotten to 
emerge ppp..."

&gt; 
&gt; G'day all,
&gt; 
&gt; The computer I bought recently had a "soft" modem (i.e. basic hardware
&gt; which needs software (read Windows) to operate). I think it was the
&gt; Conexant HSF series. I asked the computer shop if they would swap it
&gt; for a hardware modem, which they were happy to do. But what they
&gt; replaced it with was a Conexant HCF series. This is no different: you
&gt; still need Windows to run it. When I queried this, they said these are
&gt; the only modems they ever sell.
&gt; 
&gt; I can download Linux drivers from linuxant.com but they cost
&gt; money. That's not such a big deal, except it seems a great pity that I
&gt; have to deal with the hassle of doing that.
&gt; 
&gt; Now what is going on here? Is it:
&gt; 
&gt; (a) It's impossible to get a real modem anymore, and all Linux users
&gt; download software drivers like from Linuxant;
&gt; 
&gt; (b) It's easy to get a real modem, I just need to shop around;
&gt; 
&gt; (c) I don't know what I'm talking about, there is no difference
&gt; between "hard" and "soft" modems. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; (d) It's impossible to get a real modem anymore, but I don't have to
&gt; download the drivers because all/most Linux distributions contain
&gt; drivers for all/most common soft modems. (I'm using RedHat 9).
&gt; 
&gt; If the answer is (b) I'd appreciate knowing a type of modem
&gt; (preferably internal) which is easy to get in Adelaide. The computer
&gt; shop seems cooperative and I suspect they'd get it for me if I asked.
