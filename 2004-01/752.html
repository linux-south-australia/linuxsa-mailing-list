Who is WinServer 2003 targetted at ??

For Big business / government, decisions are made in a slow moving
strategic fashion, and strategies are evaluated on a lot of different
levels.  The existence of this web page would not have much of a dent in
the way that these people already make their decisions.

For small / medium enterprises, they read all the blurbs that are thrown
at them, but at the end of the day they go with the recommendations that
they receive from trusted individuals that they deal with.

It is mostly this army of computer geek types on the ground that allowed
Windows to get where it is in the first place - by making
recommendations, pissing in people's ears, and even working overtime to
see their preferred solutions installed before a decision was ever made,
so as to bypass the process entirely by default.

These are the tactics that work perfectly well for Linux as well. Ive
done this a number of times in different situations - you just work out
what people are planning to do, and then you go off and do it anyway,
and shove the (linux based) solution under their noses before an
official decision is made. Its good enough to delay a decision
indefinately, and grow a whole network of linux systems in a business
before they have a clue that their business has become assimilated into
the Borg/Penguin.   


A bunch of wise man once said :
- A foot in the door is worth more than two birds in the hand.  
- The hand that rocks the keyboard rules the lan
- A grouse on the moor ne'er geht an auld lang syne
- The leprechaun always smiles on a Tuesday


&gt; 
&gt; I'd submit that the only way to fight a fire is to either put it out, or to
&gt; take away its ability to spread by back burning...  Accordingly, I think
&gt; it's time to out market MicroCrashes by getting proactivly agressive.
