&gt;&gt; I have ALL the LFS stuff downloaded, but now what?!?!?!?! I think I
&gt;&gt; need to do a lot of reading up before going any further.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have also downloaded ALL the Small Linux stuff. Still cant get it to
&gt;&gt; boot up for me :(
&gt;
&gt; That's the pain. :)
&gt;
&gt; Give Gentoo a go, compile a few things, read the ebuilds, then you'll 
&gt; be in better shape to tackle LFS.


Gentoo on a 486 is going to be *really* ugly unless he does his builds 
on another machine; I remember a friend building PHP3/Apache/MySQL on a 
486/66 years and years ago, and it took about a week.  Today's source 
would take even longer.

Are there any easy to follow guides on running Gentoo ebuilds on one 
machine, and moving it over to another install?  Probably the easiest 
way for Ian to do this is to actually install on another machine, 
configure as he likes, then use ghost to copy it to the laptop HD, but 
instructions on other methods won't hurt.

Something you may have forgotten though is that source-based distro's 
will ALWAYS take up more hard drive space than binary distro's, due to 
the extra development libraries and applications needed to compile this 
stuff; it can actually add up to be quite a bit, sometimes double what 
an identically-configured/installed binary distro would take up, often 
more.  I don't suppose Gentoo has a way of 'freezing' a system and 
removing un-needed development libraries and tools?
