&gt; &gt; I presume these "cheap" ones don't count as the sort of equipment

&gt; 
&gt; A safe presumption...  *Grins*
&gt; 
&gt; Without getting too bogged down in technical specifications, 
&gt; it'd be safe to say you'd have to add another (minimum) $27k 
&gt; onto your $1k budget to acquire a second hand camera that 
&gt; would do the job to 4:3 ratio (the standard tv ratio we've had 
&gt; since the 70's) analogue broadcast specifications... (That no-
&gt; one uses any more of course because the whole worlds MINIMUM 
&gt; standard is now 16:9 ratio (wide screen) digital... Which of 
&gt; course means that if you want to do something that's going to 
&gt; stand up to the test of time, you'd want it be 16:9 HDTV 
&gt; standard; which would add another $200k (minimum) on top of 
&gt; that again...

erm... There are at least 4 streams running, would that make it $800k?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think Ryan was hoping to reach people who:
&gt; &gt; - would be coming (or would like to come) to LCA anyway
&gt; &gt; - wouldn't mind paying less than what they would otherwise pay to
&gt; &gt;   attend the conference
&gt; &gt; - happen to own a firewire camera
&gt; &gt; - wouldn't mind pointing that camera at a speaker for a few hours each
&gt; &gt;   day
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sounds like a good deal to me.
&gt; 
&gt; That's probably because (with all due respect) you have no 
&gt; concept of how much work goes into producing a product that 
&gt; anyone wants to watch. *Grins*

The people who will want to watch the recording would probably watch it
under water with a clamp on their big toe. :)

&gt; 
&gt; For example, even a domestic camera operator would need to set 
&gt; up before the event including securing a power source, and 
&gt; then running power cord to it.

Maybe there are plenty of power outlets close to where they are needed
in the theatre, or the batteries will be enough...

&gt; 
&gt; Then (for Occupational Health and Safety reasons) you'd need 
&gt; to securely gaffe tape the power cable between the outlet and 
&gt; the camera as well as both procuring and setting up a decnt 
&gt; FLUID Head tripod. (One that moves smoothly instead of jerkily)

All valid points for a pro production. What it seems to me LCA is trying
to do here is to capitalise on a support offer from Apple for production
of a DVD. If you think about it, they aren't talking anything like
'Broadcast quality' - the whole lot will be on a DVD which is way below
Broadcast Quality anyway, and last time I checked a DVD only carries a
couple of hours full size movie. It would seem that the picture size
will be smaller and the compression cranked up to make it fit.

Given the low budget, the size constraints, the amateur equipment and
operators, perhaps David or someone else could help LCA do the best it
can with a less than PRO setup? I'm sure a few minutes of training, and
some pro eyes over the setup would make a big difference to the finished
article.
