I've had excellent success with middle-button/wheel mice on X under
Debian and on Windows where I use it with Unigraphics. Easy to set up,
nice to use, feels a bit strange under the middle finger for a while,
but you soon get used to it.
If you've got the option of going optical -- do it!
You won't look back, you'll never have to clean those sticky little
mouse furr balls off the contact rollers of your mouse again!


Cheers,
David Creed

Hi all,

Well, I don't really hate meeces.  I need to upgrade my mouse at home,
and was thinking of going with one of those USB wheel jobbies (either
optical or traditional ball, I'm not fussed).  Being a die-hard X user,
I'm addicted to the third button (and Plan9 requires it as well), and I
was wondering how people coped with mice where the third button involved
pressing down on the wheel.  I have one at work, and although it doesn't
do anything (as it's on a Windows
machine) it feels pretty unnatural  to do so.  How do people cope with
it?  Or are there actually three button mice with separate wheels? In
the words of Corey Taylor, "Thoughts?"

Cheers,
  Daryl Tester
