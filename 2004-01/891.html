&gt; This is stupid, Paul.

Riiiiight....  try that with someone else Mark.  Before you call this stupid I suggest you READ the Act.

&gt; You know as well as I do where the line in that case would fall.
&gt; As you posit in your email message, it comes down to intent.

&gt; If, on the other hand, you heard about it through some third
&gt; party and decided to try it out for yourself instead of notifying
&gt; the affected organization, I'm pretty sure that they'd have
&gt; grounds to complain to the police.  After all, you didn't *have*
&gt; to gain unauthorized access to the system, did you?  You could
&gt; have just told them about what you'd "discovered."

What - so go telling an organization before I'd actually checked out whether what I was told was actually correct or not?  I think I would be stupid to do that.  I would want to check the *facts* before I go to an organization and tell them.  The last thing I want is to tell an organization without checking whether it was actually true or not.

&gt; As you say, intent matters.  s44 of the Summary Offences Act
&gt; in SA makes it unlawful to gain any access whatsoever to a
&gt; restricted access system without permission.  The concept of a
&gt; "restricted access" system is well-defined in the law;  So is
&gt; the concept of permission.  It makes no difference under the law
&gt; whether you downloaded credit card numbers, altered data, or
&gt; discovered secrets which you weren't supposed to see.  The mere
&gt; act of gaining access without permission is an offence, regardless
&gt; of whether you profited, benefited or caused any damage.

&gt; So:  you've made this "discovery".  What would you do about it?
&gt; It isn't hard for a court to make an assessment of "intent"
&gt; based on the answer to that question.

I would tell the organization.  I always have and have never gone public with it.  (in theory of course) :)

Though some organizations *deserve* to be gone public on.  Their security is so up the creek (again not Node - I am a happy Node client) that their clients deserve to know IMHO - but I don't think you can do that and wouldn't try it.

But let's look at what the Act *actually* says about "gaining access without permission" that you are referring to Mark:

======================================
Summary Offences Act of SA Section 44:
Unlawful operation of computer system 

        44. (1) A person who, without proper authorisation, operates a restricted-access computer system is guilty of an offence. 

        (2) The maximum penalty for an offence against subsection (1) is as follows: 

        (a)         if the person who committed the offence did so with the intention of obtaining a benefit from, or causing a detriment to, another--$2 500 or imprisonment for 6 months; 

        (b)         in any other case--$2 500. 

        (3) A computer system is a restricted-access computer system if-- 

        (a)         the use of a particular code of electronic impulses is necessary in order to obtain access to information stored in the system or operate the system in some other way; and 

        (b)         the person who is entitled to control the use of the computer system has withheld knowledge of the code, or the means of producing it, from all other persons, or has taken steps to restrict knowledge of the code, or the means of producing it, to a particular authorised person or class of authorised persons. 
======================================

Hmmm - note particularly 3(a) - "the use of a particular code of electronic impulses is necessary in order to obtain access to information...." don't forget this is AND 3 (b) - it is withheld knowledge.

Sorry Mark your argument loses complete credibility here, you make it publicly available from a web site then it's not restricted, this particular Act says I can access it.  Period.

<A HREF="http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/Catalog/Legislation/Acts/S/SUMMARYOFF.htm">http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/Catalog/Legislation/Acts/S/SUMMARYOFF.htm</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/soa1953189/s44.html">http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/soa1953189/s44.html</A>

That's the references to the Act if you would like it.
Note in it's introduction it says:
This database contains copies of South Australian Acts as consolidated in 1991 and all subsequent Acts. 
Last updated: 28 August 2003 

&gt; Even if I could or did copy credit card data for all the
&gt; organisation's clients, which I could do because it is publicly
&gt; available information, is that illegal because a careless sysadmin
&gt; has rendered it publicly available? 

&gt; It's not "publically available" just because it's possible for
&gt; the public to access it.  If you've gained unauthorized access
&gt; to a restricted access computer system by exploiting the carelessness
&gt; of a sysadmin, expect to be prosecuted.

I don't think so given the above.

&gt; It also makes no difference whether you've copied that credit
&gt; card data anyway.  Gaining access without authorization is the
&gt; offence.

No - gaining access to a "restricted-access" computer system is an offence.  Not if it is publicly available information on the internet without a "code" to access it.  That's what the Act says...

&gt; I'd recommend that anyone in South Australian jurisdiction who
&gt; is planning on breaking into a computer somewhere look the law
&gt; up.  It's a very powerful and broad piece of legislation which
&gt; extends trespass to include computer systems.  The penalties
&gt; are, shall we say, pretty serious.

Agree.  I'd suggest they don't "break into" a computer system - it's not worth it.

&gt; You're proposing that a court, when confronted with evidence that
&gt; you'd added a root user, wouldn't conclude that you had intent to
&gt; gain unauthorized access to a restricted access computer system,
&gt; and that adding the root user wasn't illegal?!

&gt; What planet are you on, Paul?  Are you serious?

&gt; The law doesn't care whether you had intent to steal, alter or
&gt; destroy data.  The law cares whether you knowingly entered
&gt; without permission.  That's all that matters.  Go directly to
&gt; jail, do not pass "Go", do not collect $200.  If you compound
&gt; the illegality by altering data (e.g., adding a root account),
&gt; how many other charges do you think you'll be clocking up?

Yes it does Mark, stop using the Act and read it for a moment, see 44 (2) (a) and (b) of the act, the "intent" has to be there and be proven, otherwise no jail sunshine.  No intent - no jail.

&gt; It's not a murky area.  Section 44 of the Summary Offences Act
&gt; was enacted in the late 80's.  Some of the members of this list have
&gt; been successfully prosecuted under its terms;  there's a volume of
&gt; caselaw supporting it.

&gt; It's not ambiguous.  You've just drawn the line between criminality
&gt; and legality in the wrong place.

And rightly so they be prosecuted - if they intentionally do it they deserve everything they get.  Well - I'm only reading what the Act says - some of your arguments just don't hold up when you actually read the Act.
