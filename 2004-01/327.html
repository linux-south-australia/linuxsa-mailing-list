&gt;&gt; Perl descended from nawk?

&gt; Don't think descended in the sense of derived from, rather think of influence.
&gt; Clearly awk had a major influence on Perl, although I agree with your doubt
&gt; about nawk because I think Perl predates nawk.

I don't have a problem with Perl being descended from awk (in the
"influential" sense).  I certainly don't consider nawk to be much of
a derivation from awk.

&gt;&gt; Scheme from Algol 60?

&gt; I don't know Scheme, but after a quick read from www.scheme.org, might
&gt; I suggest that the Algol influence was block-structured and procedural
&gt; programming.  (Just a guess.)

Which would have been derived from its Lisp heritage, not Algol.

&gt;&gt; Bash from csh?

&gt; Bash borrows clearly from csh.  Command history (e.g. ls followed by
&gt; !-1) is straight out of csh.

I wasn't talking command line history, but I concede your point.

&gt; It borrows in other ways, too.

This is what I'm curious about; as far as I'm aware, it doesn't
share a lot in common with csh, syntactically or semantically
(e.g. "setenv" is a no go, file redirection clearly follows sh
behaviour).
