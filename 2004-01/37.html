David,

&gt; In sumary: I DID understand that no-one is talking about getting
&gt; professionals to come in and do this...  But let's be honest here...  Do
&gt; you want to be able to hear the audio? Then it needs to be set up
&gt; properly.  Do you want to be able to see the speaker?  Then someone needs
&gt; to be working the camera that knows how to focus and frame.  Do you want
&gt; people to sue you for tripping over your cables and scraping their knee? 
&gt; Then you have to gaffe the cables down.  Do you want each speaker to be
&gt; taped in all the different areas of the Venue you're featuring?  Then you
&gt; need to have set-ups where each speaker will be.  Do you want to be able
&gt; to SEE each speaker?  Then you need to understand lighting requirements.

You have missed our point, but I was expecting you to do so. We are not
producing this for the general public, we're producing it for a specific,
well-defined audience.

&gt; Geoffrey, I've only lightly touched on the very tip of the Iceberg to
&gt; illustrate to you that the reason it probably sounds like a good idea to
&gt; you because (like the majority of people) you don't understand how much
&gt; work goes into producing even a bad product - much less a good one that
&gt; doesn't look amateur...  :-)

Well, the audience won't care if it looks amateur. They will care if it
happens. I can see you're a perfectionist, that's fine. We don't require a
perfect or even good product...

DSL

(1) I know what's happening; those who can't, won't or don't care about
    Linux.Conf.Au are now trying to detract from it. *hmmm*
