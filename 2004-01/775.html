&gt; Well considering the speed at which criminal networks function these

&gt; advocating something like that lessens the speed of communication

&gt; your view is unrealistic and compromises have to be (and have been)

Not good enough, and not the way it's done either.

Sensitive information is segregated onto internal networks that have no 
physical connection to public networks. Separate computers are utilised 
for access to public networks.

&gt; And anyway, since you want to push the 'reality' angle, here you go; 
&gt; banks
&gt; DO put personal details on networks and SAPol DOES put sensitive files 
&gt; on
&gt; networks. That ain't about to change any time soon so they have a
&gt; responsibility to protect stakeholders in the information and have been
&gt; given the mandate to punish those who try to breach any security 
&gt; measures
&gt; put in place, benevelent or not. Arguing that Banks and other places
&gt; shouldn't put info on networks is about as effective as arguing that
&gt; crackers just shouldn't try to breach security in the first place.

Funny, the military doesn't agree with you. Then again, it builds 
information systems that hold up in wartime situations instead of 
taking cheap shortcuts.

Tell me more about these sensitive files on public networks... are they 
really connected to public networks? How are they protected? Are there 
any plans to move them to private networks? Any intention of properly 
implementing at least SECMAN 3 to adequately protect this information?

I hope the situation isn't as bad as it sounds, as there are ways of 
properly managing information in a secure and safe way. It would be 
incredibly irresponsible to bypass those procedures out of ignorance or 
for convenience.
