Hi all,

Sorry about the repeated mailing, but our requirements have grown again... We've
appointed one person, and we need two more. One of those positions is for
someone very technically capable, able to learn new things and pass them on to
others in the team. The second position is for someone with a few years of Unix
experience under their belt, and some familiarity with web applications and
networking. Both positions require high performance under pressure, an ability
to deal with clients in a professional manner, persistence, and lots of
teamwork.

We don't have a specific closing date, but we are looking for people to start
very soon, and are already interviewing. If you are interested, please contact
me off-list, or call me on 0412 827 805, and I will send you the Job Spec and
directions on how to apply. If you know of anyone else who may be available,
please pass this on to them, and ask them to contact me directly.

Cheers

rr

Quoting Richard Russell &lt;<A HREF="mailto:richardrussell@adam.com.au">richardrussell@adam.com.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; This is not a job ad. I just happen to work for someone who may be wanting
&gt; to
&gt; employ some people in the near future.
&gt; 
&gt; The work involves configuring Apache, compiling and configuring custom
&gt; Java-based software, some SSL setup, and assorted other bits and pieces -
&gt; some
&gt; networking knowledge helps, as does some systems admin experience.
&gt; Familiarity
&gt; with scripting, HTML and some Java would also help. It's all on high end
&gt; Sparc
&gt; hardware running Solaris 8 and 9, in a Windows desktop environment. There's
&gt; also the opportunity for some overseas travel. It's relatively demanding
&gt; work,
&gt; mainly because there's so much going on at once, and it's mission-critical
&gt; for
&gt; the client, rather than because of difficult technical problems.
&gt; 
&gt; There's likely to be more than one opportunity, and it's likely that there
&gt; will
&gt; be more in the coming year as well. I'm purposefully leaving the level of
&gt; the
&gt; position unclear, because that really depends on the skills and experience
&gt; of
&gt; the applicants.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone's interested, email me off-list (I'll be immediately unsubscribing
&gt; again), and I'll put you in contact with the right people. I have no vested
&gt; interest in being an intermediary (I'm not a recruiter, or in HR, and there
&gt; is
&gt; no "spotter's fee"), and I'm not acting in any official capacity by sending
&gt; this email, I'm just keen to help find the right people for this work...
&gt;
