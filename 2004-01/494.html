&gt; The circumstances under which the US President can/will engage the
&gt; US in a 'police' action are not that broad, and the level of perceived
&gt; provocation has to be high. To actually declare war requires the
&gt; approval of Congress and the level of perceived provocation has to
&gt; be even higher.

You've TOTALLY missed my point, Richard.

What *you've* focused upon is the mechanics of one of the reasons I was
listing that people in today's society might use to state why they
vehmenantly hate America...  What *I* was trying to focus on was that
although there are many legitimate reasons why people can choose to hate the
United States; what is NOT reasonable is to take the vehemently extremist
tone that Richard did.

As to what you wrote (specifically) I'm not quite sure which brain washing
branch (CIA, NSA, etc) has gotten to you, but I'd just like to point out ONE
of the circumstances over the last half Century alone where the United
States has engaged in what it chooses to call 'Police actions'...  That
being Cuba.  The only threat (originally) was that America had invested
large sums of cash in Cuba as a holiday destination and it's decendancy
towards Communism after the Revoloution was against the investments of the
power brokers that got John F. Kennedy into the White House.  In this
instance, there was no Cuban provocation whatsoever as they were in no way
able to threaten the United States in any way, shape, manner or form.  As a
matter of fact, it was not until AFTER the bay of pigs invasion America
brokered that Castro chose to enlist the USSR's assistance in providing
nuclear missles - primarily to DEFEND against further American agression.
Further examples include Grenada, Korea, Vietnam...  Need I really go on?

The signifigance/relevance of this refresher course in American history is
that American business follows in the steps of it's President's (or is that
the other way around?) utilising the strategy of proactivly
isolating/crushing (by any means possible - legal or otherwise) anything
that threatens their desire to attempt to dominate their arena.  This is
what we see SCO trying to do - just as it's what we see Microsux having done
(continuing to do) for many many years...  Accordingly, I would submit that
even though your Post completely misses the point that *I* was trying to
make; I not only believe that what I wrote was relevant to what *I* was
trying to say - but was also relevant to the original posting in every way.

Just a FINAL clarification: The checks and balances system that is SUPOSED
to seperate Legislative and Executive power (Congress and President) and
prevent either from doing whatever they darned well want - with 0
accountability - was effectivly eliminated recently (and publicly) thanks to
911.  Thanks to Bush's parties skillful manipulation of events, the party
successfully removed its obligation to go before Congress to decleare war by
declaring a blanket war on 'Terrorism'  And because America defined its
enemy so broadly and Congress was so stupid to not force the Bush
administration to be more specific - America can currently (with 0
accountability) send troops, missles (etc) everywhere in the world right
now, any time, any where, any place - under nothing else except the pretext
(whether it ends up true or not) that the target nation(s) are hiding
terrorist cells and/or weapons of mass destruction...  (Whether it ends up
being true or not)

Dangerous times we live in indeed when a war exists that has no specific
enemy - except that which the Bush administration chooses to define as
one...
