&gt; Romana, David, 
&gt; 
&gt; Happy new year,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; nonetheless, for many of us, its just part of the
&gt; &gt; budget that won't
&gt; &gt; stretch. 
&gt; 
&gt; Why advertise that fact on this list. If you can't go,
&gt; you can't go, get over it :-| 

because it MAY be something that can be incorporated into future confs.
because awareness is a step towards change.

from the tone of your response, i have to wonder - do you wish we on lower 
incomes would quietly sit back and say nothing? if so, sorry for disturbing you:)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; i just wish it was possible that such events could
&gt; &gt; be more open to the
&gt; &gt; greater, struggling, coalface type community - to
&gt; &gt; whom even 99 dollars
&gt; &gt; is a hefty whack. i know too many people on austudy
&gt; &gt; who would prefer to 
&gt; &gt; eat, for example....
&gt; 
&gt; It's supply and demand, simple economics :-|
&gt; If prices were $10 you couldn't hold a conference like
&gt; this, there would be too much interest. If you play
&gt; your cards right the money invested could show a
&gt; profitable return. Networking. If you want it, go get
&gt; it!

no, but perhaps there is a way to change things. perhaps there are ways
to offset costs further. each conf teaches the next one more. sitting
back not mentioning the difficulties means noone is the wiser, so
nothing is learnt.

certainly, the organisers of this one bend over backwards to learn
adapt, and assist. they are proactive, responsive, and certainly not
prone to complaining if they are made aware of things like this.

&gt; &gt; certainly, the organisers have all been happy to
&gt; help
&gt; &gt; computerbank/itshare sa whenever they could. they
&gt; &gt; are community aware.
&gt; &gt; but shaun, as coordinator of computerbank/itshare,
&gt; &gt; is certainly even
&gt; &gt; more aware of the disparity issue. its the raison
&gt; &gt; d'etre of what we do.
&gt; &gt; scarcely a sob story, no? a sob story would be
&gt; &gt; whinging WITHOUT doing
&gt; &gt; anything.
&gt; 
&gt; With all respect, this isn't about
&gt; computerbank/itshare. 


with all respect, it is about community, the linux community, and
interested parties. itshare is such a party. 

which of our recipients could afford even the concession rate? answer : 
none. hence they missout on involvement. ok, the vast majority of them 
wouldnt be interested. but the one or two who would, well, if the 
organisers are aware of the difficulties, may be offered ways of attending.

hoping for a kinder, more inclusive new year for everyone,
r:)
