Hi List,
I have a small collection of functional 486 boards and chips with ram which
I need to remove from the carport. I checked with Computerbank but they are
too low level.
I was using them as DSL routers (2 of them) and they work fine. I since
upgraded to a handme down p1 so they are surplus.

If anyone is interested can you contact me off list, failing that they will
end up at the tip.

Items
486-sx33, dx66, dx-133
2 486 mobos caseless, 1x 16mb ram, 1x 4 mb ram (slots are free)
1 digital pc with 8mb ram 2 110 hdds which was my router it's a slim line
most of the pieces are loose but I only needed the fdd from it anyway. Comes
with KBD and mouse (hehe)
1x Panasonic kxp1180 dot matrix works fine been in a box for 2 years though
1x HP laser toner not sure its state as it's in a sealed box and I never got
the HP I was intending to.
1x internal ISA fax/modem 14400 - works great (for its time)
1x internal ISA 2400 modem - my first modem *sniff*
small box of assorted ISA nics  and video cards they were working a year ago
when they got put away

from memory that's about it.

I would rather the lot go than dribs and drabs

Thanks
Evan
