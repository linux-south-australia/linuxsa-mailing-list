&gt; I admit to being that :-)
&gt; and I challenge others on this list to admit to
&gt; cranking out pages and pages of yawn-inducing drivel.
&gt;
&gt; Gazza,

I'll take your challenge Gazza!!!

I hereby publicly admit that (just today) I inadvertantly shoved my foot =
so
far into the back of my throat that I'll be passing toe nails for the =
next
month!!!  ;-)

That said, I'd also like to point out that I didn't INTEND on pointing =
DSL's
one and only fault out to him in front of the entire group (Sorry M8) =
nor
did I deliberatly intend on making a horses rear end of myself while =
trying
to make the point that (I thought) it was ludicrous to ask someone =
capable
of doing a reasonable job digitising the event to pay for the priveledge =
of
doing so... (Sorry to everyone else - especailly including the =
Organisers)

The difference accordingly (as far as *I* can tell) is that although I =
may
pop out mini-novels of mind numbing drivel (no extra threads upon =
threads
agreeing please) ;-)  at least I can honestly say that I'm not out to
deliberatly alienate and/or offend anyone - and have the decency to
apologise when I realise that I've inadvertantly done so...

David WOLVERTON
