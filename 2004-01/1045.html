It seems to be a six-degrees thing. The worm spoofs addresses when 
sending, and learns new addresses to spoof based on other infected 
emails it is receiving.

I had an idea today was going to be fun when I unzipped the first 
attachment to see 2 files at a glance in the temporary directory:

$ ls
readme.htm
.exe

I went to check out  the readme.htm with a command line tool, and the 
tab autocomplete showed me that it was in fact 1 file that had exactly 
the right number of spaces in the file to wrap the line on a standard 
80-column terminal. An interesting coincidence. In windows gui zip 
utlities, I guess the .exe part isn't visible - clicking on a .htm can't 
be harmful, right? :)

&gt;That might be a good hint. Is it possible that there are some infected
&gt;customers who still point to that box?
&gt;  
&gt;

Not very. All customers are configured to point to a hostname that has 
long since been pointed elsewhere. The mails coming directly to this box 
are coming from IP's outside of our network and on the other side of the 
world that wouldn't be allowed relay, so it's unlikely that anyone has 
this host set as their SMTP server unless they're particularly tolerant 
of not being able to send mail.
