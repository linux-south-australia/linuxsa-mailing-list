You're allowed to record private information in chalk on the sidewalk 
if you really want, but don't have any expectation that your 
information will remain private just because it's behind a firewall.

If you seriously expect that a few swiggles of ink on some bits of 
mashed up wood makes a difference, you need to think again.

&gt; What if, in a few years time, it turns out that the firewall has a bug,
&gt; and you know about the bug and I don't;  Does that mean that, as far
&gt; as you're concerned, the private info I have behind the firewall is
&gt; now "public" because you can access it?

It means that I should be able to tell you about the bug in your 
firewall without being prosecuted. Imagine if telling you that your fly 
was unzipped meant I could be prosecuted for perving at your willy!

For that matter, how was the bug discovered? Only by someone trying to 
break the security on the broken firewall!

&gt;&gt; I'm advocating that much of the information that may be kept on the 
&gt;&gt; police network should NOT be plugged into the Internet.
&gt;
&gt; Why is the Internet so special?

Because it's really really public and there's a really really good 
chance that someone will have a go. Consider that all the email viruses 
and DoS attacks are actually examples of successful automated hacks 
with nobody to be caught. Nothing prevents those viruses from having a 
payload that compromises security in far more imaginative ways.

Do you have any objections to the police keeping your private 
information on a public webserver? What about on a public machine with 
ROT-13 encryption? Where is the line drawn, and why are you drawing a 
line when you're arguing that the law provides the protection you want?

&gt; You reckon that the only way I can have any expectation of privacy
&gt; is to disconnect myself from the network.  Is the telephone network
&gt; included in that?  How about the road network...?

Yes. Yes. Yes. You can choose which bits of information to connect and 
which bits to disconnect.

Someone brought up the example of convenience. There's much better ways 
of handling this... for example, rather than storing private 
information in plain-text, that information could be stored in crypto 
with the customer providing the key.

&gt; Pah.  Stupid, stupid argument.  We don't need to have this fight, we
&gt; can have it in the courts.
&gt;
&gt; (because, at the end of the day, you KNOW you'd lose this argument in
&gt; front of a judge)

You have a touching faith in the law, completely missing a number of 
important points that invalidate your perspective:

	1) The law can only be applied to people who are caught.
	2) The law in one country is different from the law in another country.
	3) There are people who don't care about the law.
	4) There's probably a law against flying planes into buildings.

Your faith in the law protects you against one, and only one group, of 
people... those who get caught. It's a very small group when considered 
against the wider world, and against people who don't care if they get 
caught (eg, people who fly planes into buildings).

In a war, all the laws are out of the window except for the Rules of 
Engagement (and only if they get caught). So should a peacetime economy 
build and base itself on weak structures that can be destroyed at the 
push of a button? It is irresponsible to be deliberately weak to save 
money, then cover their arses with bits of paper.

Think Microsoft and the way they don't care about security since it 
didn't impact on their bottom line until recently.

&gt; And neither does anyone, anywhere in the world, who has ever written 
&gt; any
&gt; law whatsoever about computers and networks.

There you go again. Show me a judge, and I'll show you someone who has 
no idea about computers and networks. For that matter, many laws are 
written by politicians. How much respect do you have for Richard 
"Luddite" Alston's technical prowess and deep understanding of issues?

&gt; So we have laws:  If you take advantage of the fact that physical
&gt; security isn't perfect, and go somewhere where you aren't supposed
&gt; to go, expect to end up in jail.

Gotta catch them first! Where's Osama bin Laden? While he may 
eventually be caught, there are many others who never will be.

How many unsolved crimes are on the police files? They're all people 
who didn't get caught.

&gt; Replace the word "physical" with "network" in the paragraph above
&gt; and the rule still holds.

Incorrect. Physical reality has analogies but no direct correlation 
with information.

&gt; Stupid argument.  It's already been, gone, and been settled.  Why are
&gt; we having this discussion?

Because you're wrong and I'm right. :)
