Subject: RE: Oh My init 1 remotely not good

&gt;
&gt; Hi List,
&gt; This is more annoying but anyway
&gt; I was trying to move the home partition from hda1 to hdb1 on a freesco
&gt; gateway to provide more space and well I probably misread the
&gt; steps but when
&gt; doing an init 1 I lost my connection to this as I was doing
&gt; it remotely.
I suppose you might already realize this but init 2 is most likley what you
were intending?  single user networked mode?
hehe - yeah big whoops

&gt; if I follow the steps of mounting /home to a new partition
&gt; what happens to
&gt; the old space?
The old space still exists but depending on whether you use `mv` command or
the `cp` command to move the contents of the old device to the new device
will determine if the data is still there as well as the new place.
well there wasnt much data my concern is since I redirected the path to
somewhere else will the space not being used anymore be availble to the
system on HDA1 - I guess it should be but I wasn't sure.

&gt; mount -t umsdos /dev/hdb1 /mnt/router/pkg/home

This will work just fine considering you actually have a directory called
/mnt/router/pkg/home and you have at least copied what you wanted from hda1.
Although you will have to update your /etc/fstab to reflect this change upon
successive reboots.

Yes already done (it isnt quite that easy in this case) because the mstab
(go figure) is on a ramdisk and you can never actually save it so I had to
place it in rc_user script to do it.


I hope I answered this question without missing it entirely (:
not you got it fine
Thanks
Evan
