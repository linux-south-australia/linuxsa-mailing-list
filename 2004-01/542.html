Can anyone out there in user land come up with a legal reason why
Telstra seem to be able to MAKE YOU buy one of their ADSL modems when
you sign up for a Bigpong ADSL account?
Go to the Bigpong ADSL signup pages and see if you can get past the
hardware selection page without selecting (and therefore buying) one of
their modems.
They only have 2 to choose from. One is a USB single port jobby and the
other is a 4 port ethernet modem/router with limited functionality.

I rang them last month and said that I wanted to use my hardware and not
their (over priced) gear and the Bigpong drone just repeated that you
have to choose one of the two on offer, etc.

This raises 2 questions-
How can they MAKE you buy one of their modems when the other guys will
let you use your own.
Why don't they actually tell you the makes and models of the crap they
are pedalling. (poetic license taken here- it may not actually be crap
but then we don't know, do we?)

For this reason I have recommended private clients sign up to Internode
and iinet. At least they let you choose your hardware.
(this was not intended to restart a Dlink v Billion v
'insert-favourite-brand' here type debate)
