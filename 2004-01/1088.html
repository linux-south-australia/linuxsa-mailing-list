&gt;&gt; Using www in www.organisation.tld is a nice convention...

&gt; 
&gt; As someone who works with Internet all the time, one of my pet peeves is 
&gt; when I tell someone to use a perfectly good hostname in a web browser 
&gt; and through some kind of subconcious brain process they prepend 'www.' 
&gt; to it.

thats the 'convention' we have been hammering into them for the last 8 
or so years...

 &gt; These days I find myself adding 'www' cnames to DNS in advance
&gt; rather than correcting people. 

I suppose that it reinforces the 'convention'.
Its not going to hurt any one.
Really its avoiding heartache down the track for you and the 'client'.

 &gt; 'UseCanonicalName' in Apache can also be a subtle way to make
 &gt; the point :)

=) /me re-reads his old /etc/apache/http.conf ...
ah, ok ... well most folks would never know or care anyway.

&gt; Given that the majority of domain names are used for just a web site and 
&gt; email, don't you find the 'www' somewhat superfluous?

Technically it might be unneccesary. You'll need to teach your 'users'
or 'clients' all over again. Its only a small amount of pain on your 
part to aleviate all the support dramas later down the track. IMHO.

You and I know that typically web traffic is on port 80,
and email between servers is on port 25. But the vast majority
of folks out there don't care and don't want to have to know.

Whether or not this is a good thing, is a hard call, but at least
it means there are a reasonable amount of good jobs for those that
do want to know all this technical thuggery =P

cheers,

Kim Hawtin
