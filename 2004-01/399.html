FWIW,
We bought her one of the $1499 laptops from Officeworks.  In the end much 
easier than mucking around with secondhand laptops.

The Presario2100 seems to be identical or very very similar to the Compaq 
NX9xxx series of business laptops currently available.  They have a good 
feature level and seem pretty well built.  Didn't have Knoppix to test 
booting linux but I assume it'd work to a certain degree.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; Okay with all this talk of laptops I've got a bit of a request:
&gt; 
&gt; One of my sister's is going Overseas in 3 weeks to study and needs to take a 
&gt; laptop with her (she wasn't going to but really it's silly not to).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, she obviously has slightly limited funds, but not as bad as some.  
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have or know where I can get a decent secondhand laptop for 
&gt; around $800?
&gt; 
&gt; By decent I mean at least a 600-700Mhz PIII with 256MB Ram and 14" screen?  
&gt; I've had a look on EBAY and I can get fairly close to this figure, but 
&gt; whilst normally I'd buy personally from EBAY, I'm going to have to "support" 
&gt; this device remotely so I'd like something I can see first.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions on places to look?  Anyone have one they'd like to sell? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
