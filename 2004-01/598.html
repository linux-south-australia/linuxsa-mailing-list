&gt; Can anyone out there in user land come up with a legal reason why

&gt; Go to the Bigpong ADSL signup pages and see if you can get past the
&gt; hardware selection page without selecting (and therefore buying) one of
&gt; their modems.
&gt; They only have 2 to choose from. One is a USB single port jobby and the
&gt; other is a 4 port ethernet modem/router with limited functionality.
&gt; 
&gt; I rang them last month and said that I wanted to use my hardware and not
&gt; their (over priced) gear and the Bigpong drone just repeated that you
&gt; have to choose one of the two on offer, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; This raises 2 questions-
&gt; How can they MAKE you buy one of their modems when the other guys will
&gt; let you use your own.

IANAL, but I believe that the relavent laws are stil in place,
concerning bundling. A seller of a product or service cannot force you to buy a
product or service with another product or service.

You will have to check this, as its several years old. This is main
lever with which selling a Microsoft Operating System on a laptop, for
example the Toshiba Laptop bundled with MS Windows 95 debarkle in 1996,
etc...

&gt; Why don't they actually tell you the makes and models of the crap they
&gt; are pedalling. (poetic license taken here- it may not actually be crap
&gt; but then we don't know, do we?)

Now, this is not to say that Telstra can't force you from not using
non-approved hardware from the local, relavent telecommunications
body... but if Telstra is only selling two products, they better have a
very good reason why they are not giving you a choice as a consumer.

I was told today about the experience a friend of mine had with Telstra
about how Summertown did not have ADSL, how the only choice was ISDN,
how Telstra gave four different and conflicting pricing models for the
service. So after logging a complaint with the ACCC, the response was,
"When we (ACCC) get enough complaints of a particular type we will act."

cheers,

Kim
