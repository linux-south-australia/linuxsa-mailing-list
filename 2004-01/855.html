&gt; That is an astonishing comment.  Has it escaped your notice that with
&gt; only one or two exceptions, Linux distros depend on installing binary
&gt; packages and NOT compiling applications?

I understand what I said could have been misinterpreted.  By no means 
was it bias towards users who have difficulty compiling applications; 
more-so the mentalities and attitudes.  I worded it wrong, apologies if 
you took this personally, because it certainly wasn't meant to be so.

I guess what I said is invalid.  The OSS community is perceived by the 
attitudes of the majority, and sadly, they're not always positive and 
helping.

&gt; among minority groups.  The more mainstream Linux becomes, the less
&gt; there will be silly "why should you" (want to do what I can't do)
&gt; comments.

I hope so.  I'm finding the more mainstream it's becoming, the more of 
these attitudes are becoming commonplace.  :-(

&gt; I think that the BSD community suffers less in this regard because Un*x
&gt; is well established and well regarded, so no "apology" is needed.
