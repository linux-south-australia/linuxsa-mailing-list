Hi Romana, 
 
&gt; because it MAY be something that can be incorporated
&gt; into future confs.
&gt; because awareness is a step towards change.

Change what? The dictates of money? The power of the
"haves"? Post 9/11, the only change is a widening of
the gap between rich and poor. 
Conferences are about networking. They support the
greater "good" (or "bad") of increased economic
growth, whether they are open source or not. 

The fact that you take the perspective of the "have
not" doesn't change anything. The quest to improve the
plight of the "have nots", runs the risk of becoming
altruistic patronisation. Just another form of power.
In the end everyone's in it for their own (self,
family or tribe) benefit.

&gt; &gt; It's supply and demand, simple economics :-|
&gt; &gt; If prices were $10 you couldn't hold a conference
&gt; like
&gt; &gt; this, there would be too much interest. If you
&gt; play
&gt; &gt; your cards right the money invested could show a
&gt; &gt; profitable return. Networking. If you want it, go
&gt; get
&gt; &gt; it!
 
&gt; no, but perhaps there is a way to change things.
&gt; perhaps there are ways
&gt; to offset costs further. each conf teaches the next
&gt; one more. 
&gt; sitting back not mentioning the difficulties means 
&gt; noone is the wiser, so nothing is learnt.

Yeah, right, -&gt; offset costs further: maybe microsoft
would like to sponsor the next conf :-)
I haven't heard you mention any specific ways to
'offset costs', or have you mentioned any
difficulties. Be more specific, realistic. Publicising
your insolvency/helplessness doesn't qualify as such.

&gt; which of our recipients could afford even the
&gt; concession rate? answer : 
&gt; none. hence they missout on involvement. ok, the
&gt; vast majority of them 
&gt; wouldnt be interested.

These statements are presumptuous to say the least :-|

I'd like to see constructive postings that describe in
more detail the difficulties you are referring to, not
to mention some more constuctive proposed solutions a
la DSL.

shuss,
Gazza
