&gt; Hi Shaun,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; OK, so myself and the 100 odd people that we
&gt; &gt; introduce to linux every
&gt; &gt; year are just told to sod off because we dare
&gt; &gt; question the price.
&gt; 
&gt; Wrong conclusion.
&gt; Be realistic, it's a great price. 
&gt; There are ways to get admission to a conference if you
&gt; really want to. Put your energy into that, then you're
&gt; being constructive. 
&gt; Sheesh, I'm sure if you explained your situation to
&gt; the appropriate people, you would get the desired
&gt; outcome.

are you really as silly as your emails make out? cause thats exactly
what he did.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's supply and demand, simple economics :-|
&gt; &gt; &gt; If prices were $10 you couldn't hold a conference
&gt; &gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; this, there would be too much interest. If you
&gt; &gt; play
&gt; &gt; &gt; your cards right the money invested could show a
&gt; &gt; &gt; profitable return. Networking. If you want it, go
&gt; &gt; get
&gt; &gt; &gt; it!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The implication being that the price is kept high to
&gt; &gt; keep out unsuitable
&gt; &gt; attendees- nice one.
&gt; 
&gt; Wrong again. And not constructive/positive.
&gt; You're taking the victim's perspective, so you'll be
&gt; treated like one. There are enough victims in the
&gt; world. Take the problem solver's perspective and help
&gt; mankind transcend.

unlike you, who thinks that solving involves derisive emails, this man
helped found computerbank sth australia, now itshare sa.

thats several years of hard work at solving environmental problems,
inequity problems for low income earners, and providing open source
solutions.

havent noticed you putting that energy into problem solving.

if thats being a victim, we could do with more 'victims'.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; Some people are not looking to profit out of every
&gt; &gt; experience. I wish to
&gt; &gt; learn, participate and help- you know like a
&gt; &gt; community ...
&gt; 
&gt; The reason why something doesn't work always has a
&gt; cause. Find the cause, solve it and... voila, you have
&gt; a solution. Community is nothing without the
&gt; individual.


and you, as an individual, are contributing. well, im giving you a huge
leap of faith on that one. but we all KNOW shaun is. thats teh
difference.
