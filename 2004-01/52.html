Hi Wayne,

&gt; I have to say I found your responses somewhat offensive and I hope you have
&gt; the good grace to apologise to those that I believe you've been so rude to,
&gt;
and the many others on the list who are unable to attend because of simple 
financial constraints.

I attended LCA2003 thanks to the generosity of Sun as the Regional Delegate 
from South Australia. I found a whole new view of Linux and the open source 
movement and I have tried to bring that new view back to share with those who 
could not join the conference with me.

This year I am again attending thanks to concession arrangements. I am also 
providing my time to support the conference - it might even get close to 100% 
if there are other roles found where I can assist. I don't mind giving my 
time because supporting the conference in a physical manner is a way I can 
support the development of open source. I am not a programmer or hacker, I am 
not even an experienced Linux user, but that doesn't stop me from helping 
where I can. Helping the conference to run smoother is my practical support.

I would love there to be a way more of the local users could share in the 
conference but constraints of costs and room limitations means that the 
conference has to charge a reasonable amount in order to cover the costs. It 
also has to limit the number of attendees because of the available theatre 
space thus spreading the cost over a smaller user base. The full fee is 
probably appropriate for those who can gain direct benefit for their 
employment. The concession fee is a good compromise and means that many who 
might otherwise be unable to attend because of the full fee can participate 
at a more reasonable fee.

I don't see any easy answers available to the organisers but perhaps there 
could be more open days where the general Linux user can attend and 
participate / network and at a low day fee. With the availability of the 
transcripts and recordings of the speakers that may be just the compromise 
needed to share the conference amongst a wider audience without compromising 
the integrity and leadership that LCA provides.

Like Michael I am very excited about LCA2004 and strongly urge those who 
might be contemplating attending to extract the digit and register. This is 
going to be a heck of a conference and not to be missed if you have the 
opportunity to attend. For the others like Shaun et al, the session 
recordings and the reports from those who attend will have to be all that is 
available to you for this year. Perhaps things will be different next year.

Thanks Michael and Team for putting this together. It wont be long before it 
is the 18th and you can start to merge back into family life again &lt;G&gt;

 Cheers,
 Ian
