Hi Peter and ALL

Drivers for the Conexant modem have been available for Linux for longer than
a year at <A HREF="http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/,">http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/,</A> these modems and drivers actully
work very well on an OS that can manages it resources correctly.

Cheers
Mike

Subject: Modems and "Soft" Modems under Linux


G'day all,

The computer I bought recently had a "soft" modem (i.e. basic hardware
which needs software (read Windows) to operate). I think it was the
Conexant HSF series. I asked the computer shop if they would swap it
for a hardware modem, which they were happy to do. But what they
replaced it with was a Conexant HCF series. This is no different: you
still need Windows to run it. When I queried this, they said these are
the only modems they ever sell.

I can download Linux drivers from linuxant.com but they cost
money. That's not such a big deal, except it seems a great pity that I
have to deal with the hassle of doing that.

Now what is going on here? Is it:

(a) It's impossible to get a real modem anymore, and all Linux users
download software drivers like from Linuxant;

(b) It's easy to get a real modem, I just need to shop around;

(c) I don't know what I'm talking about, there is no difference
between "hard" and "soft" modems. :-)

If the answer is (b) I'd appreciate knowing a type of modem
(preferably internal) which is easy to get in Adelaide. The computer
shop seems cooperative and I suspect they'd get it for me if I asked.
