&gt; Hi,
&gt; Okay with all this talk of laptops I've got a bit of a request:
&gt; 
&gt; One of my sister's is going Overseas in 3 weeks to study and needs to take a 
&gt; laptop with her (she wasn't going to but really it's silly not to).

is this going to be a 'laptop' proper and be bragged all over the palce?
or is this going to be a portable desktop?

you could be better of spending money on a really cheap small footprint 
PC and buying the monitor and other peripherals overseas, just a thought.

&gt; Any suggestions on places to look?  Anyone have one they'd like to sell? 

i would sugest giving the toshiba portege a wide birth. i bought two 
second hand from a liquidation sale, ex-dot-bomb so to speak and they 
were both good for about twelve months. however, the laptops went in one 
trip through aiport security at heathrow, signapore, sydney, brisbane 
and adelaide... completely fscked now =(

dainty laptops don't seem to travel well =(
my old NEC Lavie has been dropped, bounced and survived the same trip 
through airport baggage! go the desktop replace laptop =)

cheers,

Kim Hawtin
