Hi Ryan,

&gt; &gt; I moved around 3-4 months ago to a place in Athelstone.  Great place, no
&gt; &gt; complaints at all, but the Internet here stinks.
I just moved from Athelstone (Ryan Avenue) afew months ago, where (after
moving in) I discovered that even though I was promised by Hell$tra that I
could have ADSL - prior to moving from Firle - that the entire
infrastructure of Athelstone is exclusivly RIM system based; and thus
incompatable with ADSL...  Having fought (and won) against Hell$tra on
previous occasions, I once more stepped up to the crease and faced spins,
bouncers and even bodyline - all to no avail...

I fought them, begged them, pleaded with them and even threatened them - but
after almost 7 months of every trick in the book (and then some) I finally
had to admit that even though I'd won battles against them in the past
(which I can't discuss thanks to the confidentiality contracts they've made
me sign) they had most definatly won the war in Athelstone.

Consequently, although I'll be VERY happy to see you (or anyone else for
that matter) prove me wrong; just as I'd be as equally happy to see you pull
a trick that *I* didn't think of - I've now met quite afew people scattered
throughout all of the area that have had the same woes as us and so am
unhappy to advise you NOT to hold your breath...  :-(


&gt; 8-14K dialup connects
I remember quite afew times that I'd have to dial in 2 or 3 times just to
get a stable connection. (My phone bill was HORRENDOUS) As a matter of fact,
the FASTEST I ever remember connecting was 22.something - using a *56.6*!!!
LOL


&gt; &gt; Any ideas, apart from moving (which isn't a current option)?  I'm
&gt; &gt; completely out of options, sadly, and I'm slowly going crazy. :-(
Sorry Ryan, but I'm affraid you'll most probably have to do what we did and
move...  (Which is a darned shame; because Athelstone is - imho - one of the
very best areas in all of SA I've ever lived in apart from the slow band)

e people there. Very wholesome... They use words like 'Cripes'. ('For
Cripe's sake.') "Who would that be, Jesus Cripe's? The son of 'Gosh' of the
church of 'Holy Moly'? I'm not making fun of it.... You think I wanna burn
in 'Heck'?" ...Andy ROONEY
