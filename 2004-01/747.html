What does "accessible" mean, Steve?  The way you're talking, it sounds
like you believe "accessible" means "able to be reached through any
manner whatsoever, even unintended methods which nobody knew about but
which everyone had gone to great extents to prevent."

If I put up a firewall, am I allowed to record private info on systems
behind it?

What if, in a few years time, it turns out that the firewall has a bug,
and you know about the bug and I don't;  Does that mean that, as far
as you're concerned, the private info I have behind the firewall is
now "public" because you can access it?

&gt; I'm advocating that much of the information that may be kept on the 
&gt; police network should NOT be plugged into the Internet.

Why is the Internet so special?

What if it isn't on the Internet, but there's an unauthorized
internet-accessible gateway which you can exploit?  (say, a
misconfigured firewall)  Does that make it a public part of the
Internet now?

You reckon that the only way I can have any expectation of privacy
is to disconnect myself from the network.  Is the telephone network
included in that?  How about the road network...?  Should I be forced
to build a house with no doors and no windows to prevent you from
breaking into it?  And what happens when you discover some new explosive
technology which can break down my concrete?

Pah.  Stupid, stupid argument.  We don't need to have this fight, we
can have it in the courts.

(because, at the end of the day, you KNOW you'd lose this argument in
front of a judge)
