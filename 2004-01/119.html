LCA needs camera operators and firewire cameras!

As part of the fun at Linux.Conf.Au 2004, Apple are sponsoring 
production of a DVD highlighting the best parts of the conference.

For this to happen though, we need your help!  We're looking for more 
LCA Helpers (which means a discounted registration) - this time, 
people with video cameras willing to spend a few hours a day recording 
various bits.  The more, the merrier, and the better the DVD shall be.

As we're a volunteer ran event, we can't supply cameras, it's 
preferred if you can supply a firewire camera.  Apple have sponsored 
our production equipment, so there'll be an Apple G5 you can dump 
content from your cameras on via firewire, which we'll later edit for 
the DVD.  Spare media (MiniDV tapes, or whatever your camera uses), if 
you've got any, would also be quite useful.

If you're interested in being a camera operator, but you're without a
firewire camera, or you have a firewire camera you'd be willing to lend
us for the event, we're also very interested hearing from you.  We're
also looking for tripods for the speaker recording, and spare media
(MiniDV, etc) so if you can supply them, please let us know.

(Just to be clear, we consider you a 'camera operator' if you know how
to operate a camcorder; no qualifications necessary).

Be part of making this wonderful event even better!  Contact Ryan 
Verner (<A HREF="mailto:xfesty@computeraddictions.com.au">xfesty@computeraddictions.com.au</A>) if you're interested in 
helping out.
