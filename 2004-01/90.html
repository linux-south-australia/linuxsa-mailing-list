Gary,

&gt; &gt; I don't think he was being rude.  Perhaps we has
&gt; &gt; being harshly blunt,
&gt; 
&gt; I admit to being that :-) 

Yes, I can see that.

&gt; and I challenge others on this list to admit to
&gt; cranking out pages and pages of yawn-inducing drivel.

But how does one define "yawn-inducing"? Obviously what I consider this will
be and is different to what you consider it. I challenge you to crank out
pages and pages of "yawn-inducing drivel" to help define it.

You do seem extraordinarily good at it.

DSL

(1) Oh, and by the way, if you don't like the social aspects of the open
    source community in South Australia or its mailing lists, go pester some
    other people

(2) I count virtually every other person of substance on this list either
    mocking you or arguing against you

(3) My advice? Give up, put up, shut up and/or go away. It's really quite
    simple

(lol)
