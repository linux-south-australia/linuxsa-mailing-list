David,

&gt; &gt; You have missed our point, but I was expecting you to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (1) I know what's happening; those who can't, won't or don't care about
&gt; &gt;     Linux.Conf.Au are now trying to detract from it. *hmmm*
&gt; 
&gt; David, there is nothing that I've ever said or done (ever) that suggests
&gt; that I have ANYTHING but praise for Linux.Conf.Au and this last statement
&gt; accordingly is just plain OFFENSIVE...

Oh please, has the New Year softened your skin or something ;-P ?

&gt; I don't understand how illustrating why it's not reasonable to ask
&gt; people to come in 2 hours early to present a decent digital copy of the
&gt; conference - as well as having to PAY for the priveledge of doing so - can
&gt; possibly come under the catagory of detracting from the Conference
&gt; itself!!!???

I'm more pointing out that this attitude of "There's no hope", "It's not
good enough" and so forth is just plain, well, detracting. At least, in
another e-mail you're offering to help.

As to that you can either:

 * contact *me* off list
 * contact Michael Davies (<A HREF="mailto:michael@msdavies.net">michael@msdavies.net</A>)
   (if you'd prefer not to deal with me. LOL) 
 * contact Ryan Verner (<A HREF="mailto:xfesty@computeraddictions.com.au">xfesty@computeraddictions.com.au</A>)

;-)

&gt; And while I won't be attending LCA2004 for personal reasons; I have
&gt; never said/done or even suggested that I have ANYTHING but the utmost of
&gt; respect for the conference and/or its speakers -- and especially
&gt; considering that I've never made comments about my views of the price, I
&gt; think your statements(above) are the perfect illustration of why I've seen
&gt; you in so many knock-down word wars over the last 4 odd months I've been
&gt; lurking here...

I say things as I see them and I have a tendency to say them out loud to
whomever chooses to listen.

&gt; May I respectfully suggest that in future you take the time to proofread
&gt; over your E-Mail's looking specifically for comments that can be taken as
&gt; offensivly agressive unbased statements *such as the above* before hitting
&gt; your 'send' button?  :-)

I do actually proof read my e-mails. The originals would start World War III
;-P

*heh*
