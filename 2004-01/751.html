Battle Report 2004:

For years Linux/BSD/OSS has won significant gains from Microsoft in a
series of battles on the periphery of Microsoft's Empire.

Microsoft has managed to pretty well ignore the threats, since they did
not attack it's core business and revenue sources.

Open source (particularly Apache/PHP/MySQL)  has managed to all but
destroy Microsoft's hopes of ever dominating the internet server
infrastructure. With IE browsers running at some huge percentage, all
would have been lost if Microsoft owned the servers as well - god only
knows what the Net would be like if that had been allowed to happen. 
Winning the internet server war is like winning air-superiority.

As we head into 2004, the OSS troops are massed on the outskirts of the
MS Evil Empire capital, and the battle of the desktop is looming.

OSS Heavy artillery, in the form of OpenOffice, has made it clear that
we are ready to take on the source of 90% of their profit.

Gnome and KDE are getting polished up, and distros are putting the
effort in to create a nice slick desktop replacement. 

Cheap 64bit desktops are here now, which has taken MS off-guard. Fedora
Core - 1 for AMD64 released today, where is XP64 ?

Not that the battle for the desktop is about to start in earnest,
Microsoft can no longer ignore their nemesis - so expect the propaganda
machine to fire into action now, since it is the only real defense that
they have left.  

A Microsoft-financed SCO kamakaze attack looks sucessful from the point
of view of SCO committing suicide, but it has done nothing to contain
the massed swarms of Linux infantry advancing towards Redmond.

Microsoft is pinning a lot of it's hopes on not-yet-available super
weapons, such as Longhorn and Palladium. They are what, 12 months off ? 
Can Microsoft really hold off the desktop assault for a whole 12 months
relying only on propaganda ?

Time will tell.
