Reminds me of the time circa 1995 when I wasnt employed in an IT field, that
we had our local branch office connected to our Head Office in Sydney. It
was a Windows NT Server 3.5 environment.

My experience with Networks at that stage was Bulletin boards and connecting
Amigas together using Null Modem canles. Anyway, I clicked on this Icon (
network neighbourhood ) and behold..there were all these other computers
that came up in the list. I selected a few of them and nothing much of
interest until I selected one that had quite a bit of sensitive information
of the direction the company was going, strategic reports, financial
analysis etc.

I spoke to my manager about this and he suggested I raise the issue with our
Head office IT department. When I did I got a response along the lines of "
What the F&%k are you doing snooping around". Needless to say they removed
the windows share fairly quickly and implemented  better policies on where
to store information.

My own manager was very happy that I'd found this problem although it was
quite by accident.

&gt; Otherwise, we'd lose our jobs and/or be prosecuted (criminal or civil)
&gt; [see: Darren Kruse]

Just to clarify: wasn't implying anything about what Darren had done except
that, from the media reports (admittedly from the Advertiser), he had
overstepped the bounds of what his role was.

[several people asked me to clarify/expand on this - I have no insider
knowledge about the case ...]
