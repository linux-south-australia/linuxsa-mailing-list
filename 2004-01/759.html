&gt; The thing about a gate on the house is that you can tell if 
&gt; it's strong by looking
&gt; at it from a distance. No-one can tell if you looked at it 
&gt; from a security angle
&gt; when you walked by, and it isn't illegal to walk by and look 
&gt; at the gate, is it?

Well technically you are being completely passive and non-intrusive while
"looking" at this gate.  That gate that belongs to whoever is actually
giving off Photons or in a network sense could be broadcast messages that
are configured incorrectly (or arguably correctly).  Think about photons
along the same lines as broadcast messages and walla.  Someone that has
access to the sidewalk near this gate could easily listen to traffic that
the person who owns the gate is sending out, and again either analogy will
work (photons/messages). This doesn't make it illegal but what is illegal is
that if any action is taken directly against the gate because now you can
see (thanks to the photons) that the latch isn't even closed, or in the
network scenario has no password on it (or default).  I suppose if you were
blind there might be exceptions.
 
&gt; On a network, everything can be recorded, including any sort 
&gt; of casual 'looking'
&gt; at your 'front gate'. Hundreds of people 'push' on your 
&gt; network 'front gate' every
&gt; day. Wouldn't that be called 'Attempted Break-in' in the law 
&gt; book? How come we
&gt; only get excited about the people who push on the weak part 
&gt; of the gate?

Laziness / confidence / ignorance (possibly misplaced).

&gt; Which part of 'looking' is going to be called 'pushing' Can 
&gt; we have someone
&gt; charged for it, even if our defenses are adequate?

Whether the law agrees with me or not (I think it does), no part of looking
should ever IMO be consdidered unlawful.  It's the puching part after having
been sent messages (or photons) that I consider IMO to be unlawful.
