Gary,

&gt; 1. A list is a dynamic entity -&gt; changing all the
&gt; time.

Your posting format appears to be a little strange. I think that you must
have an autowrapper set between 50-60 characters.

&gt; 2. Those of you who suggest moving on to another list
&gt; are misconceived. I am now part of this list,
&gt; therefore I could equally tell you to go jump. My
&gt; presence changes the nature of this list, accept it,
&gt; I'm not leaving. From now you'll have me to contend
&gt; with.

It's such a pity that your own arrogance prevents you from seeing,
understanding or heeding that which the others are saying. But then again,
if one does see, understand or heed that which others are saying then one is
probably not arrogant.

&gt; 3. I speak for an 'x' number of silent subscribers.
&gt; Some of you willfully forget that there are many out
&gt; there who equally detest the amount of crap that
&gt; sometimes goes on this list but don't have the nerve,
&gt; gusto, audacity or literary skills to say so.

Oh, the old "I have a horde of nameless warriors who are too frightened to
speak out" argument".

&gt; 4. I caution DSL about snippet5 above.

Do you now?

&gt; To use the term 'person of substance' is
&gt; discriminatory and puts your contribution in a
&gt; questionable light.

Seeing you choose to ignore what you term as the "pecking order", of course
you would find it discriminatory as opposed to a simple statement of the
facts from a particular point of view.

&gt; (you imply that there are persons of lesser substance!
&gt; ouch).

Oh, but there are, there are. Get over it and move on.

&gt; Mockery is a demonstration of fear (1. you
&gt; cannot discern/reconstruct/replicate the real argument
&gt; and therefore resort to sardonic/demeaning responses
&gt; -- 2. you feel threatened in your [brittle] position
&gt; of security -- 3. you're a mob creature who enjoys
&gt; throwing stones). Were you aware of that?

Some of us are most arrogant aren't we? Every response some of us make
simply digs our own grave deeper and deeper. But then again, some of us are
having an attempt at drawing the worst of the other and might I say, one of
us is succeeding.

/me hands Gary some *more* rope
