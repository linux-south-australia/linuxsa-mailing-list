Most of your criticisms aren't failings of PDFs per-se, but are configurable
by whoever sets up your document.

 &gt; It requires that the whole document be downloaded before even Page 1 can
 &gt; be viewed,

That's not actually true.

 &gt; & the layout is really setup for printing, not viewing.

That's the specific problem which PDF is intended to solve (i.e., a 
representation of a document which looks the same on-screen as it will
look on paper), so that's hardly a failing.

 &gt; Just the other day I wanted to print out a .pdf, but the font was way
 &gt; too large.
 &gt; So I set about trying to change it, & found that it couldn't be done 
 &gt; because the font type/size was locked in the document.

You can shrink the whole document if you want :-)

 &gt; And of course you
 &gt; can't even cut/paste the text from it into a word processor.

Yes you can;  But only if the individual who created the document
wants you to.

(you've seen the "i-bar" text selection tool in the Acrobat reader toolbar,
haven't you?  it's there for a reason)

 &gt; The fact that it is a proprietary format is the icing on the cake.

It's not proprietary.  It is documented, and there are third-party readers
and writers.  You don't have to use Adobe's tools if you don't want to.

 &gt; Let it die a quick death!

Not likely.
