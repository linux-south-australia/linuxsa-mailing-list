Howdy Daryl,

I'm currently using the base model Logitech USB optical wheel mouse on 
my Fedora Core 1 desktop, and I like it. I don't mind using the middle 
button (i.e. pressing down the wheel), but I got used to it on windows 
first (the logitech drivers allow you to set the middle button to 
something at least slightly useful, like double click). It got detetcted 
properly by the FC1 installer, the mouse wheel sorks as expected, it all 
works fine.

I'm not sure about the advanced buttons on some of the fancier 
multi-button models (MS explorer, Logitech MX500 etc), as I've never 
tried them, but I'm sure at least the main 3 + wheel would work. You 
could always buy them from somewhere like officeworks that will let you 
return them for full refund if they don't do what you want.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I don't really hate meeces.  I need to upgrade my mouse
&gt; at home, and was thinking of going with one of those USB wheel
&gt; jobbies (either optical or traditional ball, I'm not fussed).  Being a
&gt; die-hard X user, I'm addicted to the third button (and Plan9 requires
&gt; it as well), and I was wondering how people coped with mice where
&gt; the third button involved pressing down on the wheel.  I have one at
&gt; work, and although it doesn't do anything (as it's on a Windows
&gt; machine) it feels pretty unnatural  to do so.  How do people cope
&gt; with it?  Or are there actually three button mice with separate wheels?
&gt; In the words of Corey Taylor, "Thoughts?"
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;   Daryl Tester
