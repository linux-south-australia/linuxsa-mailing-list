&gt; I think it will go onto Fedora or RedHat 9.0 or SuSE 9.2 or Mandrake
&gt; (latest) without a glitch. I've not heard of it running on a *BSD but I'm
&gt; sure that it would.

It could hardly be easier to get going on FreeBSD (as usual):

# cd /usr/ports/www/rt3 && make install

You can set some environment variables if you'd rather PostgreSQL than
MySQL, and for other configurables if you want.

I second most of David's comments, although I actually quite like the
interface. As with most of RT, there is a heavy emphasis on
extensibility and power. The interface is quite usable once you get
used to it.

If you want something out of the ordinary, it's not as easy to hack on
as other projects might be. It uses HTML::Mason, which is an
incredibly powerful package (think PHP, except perl, and it doesn't
suck ass) but probably something few have experience with.

The author is also communicative (via the mailing lists) and can be 
contracted to write your features for you.
