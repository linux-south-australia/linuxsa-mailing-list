Hi David,

On Fri, 30 Jan 2004 00:35:55 +1030, David WOLVERTON wrote
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Someone from our group (I'm not going to mention any names yet 
&gt; as I'm waiting to find out if they've got a good/legitimate 
&gt; reason) just E-Mailed me a copy of everything on my desktop; 
&gt; in a ZIP file.

Hmm. Could you check the headers on that email? (or post them to the
group, removing incriminating evidence like user names but leaving all
the transport stuff in)

There are a couple of possibilities. Either someone actually did this,
which we all know is illegal, or it just looks like someone did it.

Do you have anything unusual on your desktop? (Maybe the contents of the
zip are generic windows XP desktop contents?)

Could this be the work of a virus on your machine? Do you have a virus
checker, is it up to date, is it running? Have you run a scan since this
happenned?

&gt; 
&gt; Now assuming the best (that this persons had no idea about 
&gt; this because their PC was somehow commandeered without their 
&gt; knowledge) this still leaves me with the problem that I have a 
&gt; permenant ADSL 1.5mbit connection, behind a firewall that 
&gt; obviously isn't working/configured properly...  (Quite a 
&gt; dangerous condition I'm sure we'd all agree)

Actually, to my mind, that's the worst. That would mean that your system
is wide open and anything that tries can log in without trouble.

&gt; 
&gt; Now...  My limited understanding/skill lead me to believe that 
&gt; ALL ports are closed - and I honestly beleived that this 
&gt; shouldn't have been able to happen...  That said, it obviously 
&gt; DID happen/could happen again - and I honestly just don't have 
&gt; the skill/ability to figgure out what's missconfigured and 
&gt; close it off.  (I'm only a wannabe Geek)
&gt; 
&gt; That said, it occurs to me that because some of you guys ARE 
&gt; the best/brightest that Australia has to offer - I should ask 
&gt; if someone is willing to take half an hour or so to help me 
&gt; out...  So here's my request: I'm willing to pay anyone with 
&gt; the appropriate skill level to come over and have a look at my 
&gt; firewall so they can help me inhibit anyone but the most 
&gt; skillful/determined of hackers doing this sort of thing again.

As someone already suggested, grab an old box and run IpCop, Smoothwall,
ClarkConnect on it.

If you really have to, there are some half decent firewall apps for
windows that work substantially better than the standard stuff.

Regards,

Michael
