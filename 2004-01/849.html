&gt; &gt; a die-hard X user, I'm addicted to the third button (and Plan9 requires
&gt; &gt; it as well), and I was wondering how people coped with mice where
&gt; &gt; the third button involved pressing down on the wheel.  I have one at
&gt; &gt; work, and although it doesn't do anything (as it's on a Windows
&gt; &gt; machine) it feels pretty unnatural  to do so.  How do people cope
&gt; &gt; with it?  Or are there actually three button mice with separate wheels?
&gt; &gt; In the words of Corey Taylor, "Thoughts?"
&gt; 
&gt; You get used to it.  I have seen really odd mice though up in computer shops in that huge 
&gt; computer complex near chinatown in Sydney, with two wheels on the side of the mouse, so 
&gt; alternatives exist, but I'd suggest they'd be even wierder :-)

i have a range of usb wheeled mausbochs... i make heavy use of the
middle (third) button ... i'm a paste'a'holic =)

over the years X has adapted (slowly) to new mice hitting the market,
as have i, but there are a range of inexpensive mice hitting the shops
for under 10$ having both USB and a wheely third button =) most that
i've tried work well under X but some pretend to be ImPS/2 but aren't
or don't seem to be fully compiant =/

cheers,

Kim
