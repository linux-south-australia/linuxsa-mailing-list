I think we might be getting lost in Analogyworld here, guys.

At least answer me this; of the sysadmins amongst us, who would *like* it
(or at least be ambivalent) if someone cracked their network and told them
it was in their best interests that they did? How inclined would be to
believe them? How inclined would you be to beat the living snot out of them
(okay, ambitious for a network geek)? :-)

Okay so you'd be acting on impulse rather than using your cerebral cortex
but even when one's rational mind kicks in, I would  personally still feel a
little violated. I'm pretty distrustful of people in general (and no it's
not because I work for the cops) and I'd be wondering, even if the cracker
provided me with a full and detailed report of what happened, "What *aren't*
they telling me?"

&gt; Think about photons
&gt; along the same lines as broadcast messages and walla.  Someone that has
&gt; access to the sidewalk near this gate could easily listen to traffic that
&gt; the person who owns the gate is sending out, and again either analogy will
&gt; work (photons/messages). 

So, shining a torch at a gate latch at night (to generate reflected
photons for visual analysis) counts as what ?

What about if it is an MS-Wondergate that cant be broken into. If you
get caught trying to break into it, you will get slapped with a fine and
community service. However, if you own one, and you get caught taking
the latch mechanism apart, or worse, trying to sell a superior competing
product, then you get a massive lawsuit against you, and may well end up
in guantanimo bay, cuba, as a certified 'Enemy of Freedom(tm)'.

Burn it to the ground, I say !
