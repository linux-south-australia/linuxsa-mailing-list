Ryan, David,

Okay, so you are both in Athelstone???

I might have a bit of good news for you then, just maybe...

Telstra have plans to upgrade the RIM in Athelstone with an ADSL MINIMUX.

This means that those people connected to that RIM can then get ADSL
(provided you aren't pair-gained also*).

Telstra have this upgrade slated for the 20th of February.

So.... even if you are pair-gained(*) as well as being on the RIM...try
applying for ADSL through your chosen provider on around the 20th of Feb
this year, if it fails, try again, and keep trying a few times. As it may
take Telstra a while to update their records to indicate that theres a
minimux installed there. (this was the case with Oakden late last year).

Once this goes ahead, you should be in for a fighting chance to get ADSL...
make sure you get in early, because the minimuxes only have limited ports
available on them.

(*) Even if you are pair-gained, you may still be able to get ADSL because
Telstra may be able to 'transpose' your line to straight copper to the RIM.

&gt; Hi Ryan,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I moved around 3-4 months ago to a place in Athelstone.  Great place,
no
&gt; &gt; &gt; complaints at all, but the Internet here stinks.
&gt; I just moved from Athelstone (Ryan Avenue) afew months ago, where (after
&gt; moving in) I discovered that even though I was promised by Hell$tra that I
&gt; could have ADSL - prior to moving from Firle - that the entire
&gt; infrastructure of Athelstone is exclusivly RIM system based; and thus
&gt; incompatable with ADSL...  Having fought (and won) against Hell$tra on
&gt; previous occasions, I once more stepped up to the crease and faced spins,
&gt; bouncers and even bodyline - all to no avail...
&gt;
&gt; I fought them, begged them, pleaded with them and even threatened them -
but
&gt; after almost 7 months of every trick in the book (and then some) I finally
&gt; had to admit that even though I'd won battles against them in the past
&gt; (which I can't discuss thanks to the confidentiality contracts they've
made
&gt; me sign) they had most definatly won the war in Athelstone.
&gt;
&gt; Consequently, although I'll be VERY happy to see you (or anyone else for
&gt; that matter) prove me wrong; just as I'd be as equally happy to see you
pull
&gt; a trick that *I* didn't think of - I've now met quite afew people
scattered
&gt; throughout all of the area that have had the same woes as us and so am
&gt; unhappy to advise you NOT to hold your breath...  :-(
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 8-14K dialup connects
&gt; I remember quite afew times that I'd have to dial in 2 or 3 times just to
&gt; get a stable connection. (My phone bill was HORRENDOUS) As a matter of
fact,
&gt; the FASTEST I ever remember connecting was 22.something - using a
*56.6*!!!
&gt; LOL
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any ideas, apart from moving (which isn't a current option)?  I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; completely out of options, sadly, and I'm slowly going crazy. :-(
&gt; Sorry Ryan, but I'm affraid you'll most probably have to do what we did
and
&gt; move...  (Which is a darned shame; because Athelstone is - imho - one of
the
&gt; very best areas in all of SA I've ever lived in apart from the slow band)

&gt; Cripe's sake.') "Who would that be, Jesus Cripe's? The son of 'Gosh' of
the
&gt; church of 'Holy Moly'? I'm not making fun of it.... You think I wanna burn
&gt; in 'Heck'?" ...Andy ROONEY
