This discussion has been, at times, quite silly.  For example, if Stephen
really thinks that data cannot be stolen then I'd like to invite myself to
browse his company's filing cabinets.  I'll bring my own photo-copier. :-)

Likewise, the idea that it's okay to break into a networked computer
system because it's public infrastructure, not private, is patently daft.

On the other hand, if passwords fly by in the clear on a government
network, and I find that out just by looking at the wire, I don't think
I should be severely punished.  And if I should be, then so should the
operators of the network.  It's not reasonable to leave your car unlocked
with the engine running, and it's also unreasonable to leave your network
unlocked with the computers running.  I think that, despite the words
Stephen has been using, his angst is along those lines.

When somebody rattles doors, to use the prevailing analogy, in order to
see if they are open or not, not for malicious purposes but so that they
can then report problems, they probably have broken the letter of the law,
but have they done a good thing or a bad thing?  Is it a bad thing to
check if your computer doors really are locked?  A lot of them aren't,
which is why the Internet is such a hostile place.  It doesn't get less
hostile by slapping down someone for looking at problems.

I'm minded, not surprisingly, of Robert T Morris and the Internet worm.
He did bring down the internet, and it appeared that he did so because
his program was buggy.  If his program hadn't been buggy perhaps nobody
would have noticed what was going on until he'd changed it to do something
more than just spread.  I don't know what he planned but I do know what
he did, which was to graphically hilight some old security flaws that
had been ignored for years and years.  After his program escaped those
flaws were quickly fixed.  He was widely demonised for what he did, yet
there were also those who felt he'd done a service.  He'd made vendors
remove master passwords from sendmail, fix well known buffer overlows
in fingerd, and so on.  That was a good thing.
