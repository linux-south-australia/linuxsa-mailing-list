And with an attitude like that (fair, unbiased, etc.) you're sure to get
flamed on most lists. :-)

&gt; Thoughts?

There is a lot of this sort of thing. You'll find that any of the OS
factions around (Windows included) will have their
rabid^H^H^H^H^Hdedicated followers. You'll not see as much of it from
the Windows community, but I really think that that's because there
isn't really a community.

I was flamed quite badly for asking an NT admin list how to do a
particular thing on a Windows box that I'd been doing on a Unix machine
(a form of transparent proxying). Having said that, there were also a
few people who helped me with my problem.

You'll often find that some of the camps are worse-informed than some of
the Unixy types. Many Windows users (for example) will bag Unix
endlessly, but haven't seen a Unix box. Ever. Many Unix people have done
some kind of Windows systems admin or something.

Either way, I use the right tool for the job. That often ends up being
some flavour of Unix, but there are times where I've used something
else.

thx,
Matt
