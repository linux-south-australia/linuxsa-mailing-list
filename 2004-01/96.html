Hi all,

In answer to some responses to my arrogant,
provocative, against-the-grain posts, herewith a
collective reply: 

First some snippets I've chosen to respond to:
&lt;snippet1&gt;
If you had more of a clue about who uses this list,
you'd know you'd 
have to be really special to be able to strut around
like the only 
rooster in Chicken Run. I'm prepared to suspend
judgment pending proof 
of whether you've got the goods.
So... do you?
&lt;/snippet1&gt;

&lt;snippet2&gt;
The difference accordingly (as far as *I* can tell) is
that although I may
pop out mini-novels of mind numbing drivel (no extra
threads upon threads
agreeing please) ;-)  at least I can honestly say that
I'm not out to
deliberatly alienate and/or offend anyone - and have
the decency to
apologise when I realise that I've inadvertantly done
so...
&lt;/snippet2&gt;

&lt;snippet3&gt;
OK, I'll admit that much of what I crank out is
yawn-inducing drivel 
(thank god, someone who can spell drivel properly
shows up :-)
&lt;/snippet3&gt;

&lt;snippet4&gt;
sorry gazza - just because YOU, oh great newbie, think
its mind numbing
drivel, doesnt make it so.
gazza, if we fail to meet your high expectations - you
are free to seek other lists. but your incredible
arrogance so far in joining a list then informing
everyone how it SHOULD be - well, its breathtakingly
entertaining.
stop being silly, relax, participate, stop being so
damned abrasive.
&lt;/snippet4&gt;

&lt;snippet5&gt;
(2) I count virtually every other person of substance
on this list either mocking you or arguing against you
&lt;/snippet5&gt;

There is a perception that one must be knowlegdeable,
have proven ones credibility, or been on a list for
'x' time for ones posts to be tolerated.
This is kwatsch. :-)
1. A list is a dynamic entity -&gt; changing all the
time.
The tide never comes in the same way twice. Those of
you who feel threatened in the relative security of
the list are showing your resistance to that change,
or denying it completely. That's OK. 
2. Those of you who suggest moving on to another list
are misconceived. I am now part of this list,
therefore I could equally tell you to go jump. My
presence changes the nature of this list, accept it,
I'm not leaving. From now you'll have me to contend
with.
I don't believe in personalisation, so I won't attack
people personally (you can feel safe :-). By all means
attack me personally (I know who I am, I can handle
it). I acknowledge that there is something called
pecking order (a remnant from an ancient non-wired,
non-networked past, a form of bullying) but I don't
comply with its machinations, or subscribe to its
impositions.
3. I speak for an 'x' number of silent subscribers.
Some of you willfully forget that there are many out
there who equally detest the amount of crap that
sometimes goes on this list but don't have the nerve,
gusto, audacity or literary skills to say so.
4. I caution DSL about snippet5 above.
To use the term 'person of substance' is
discriminatory and puts your contribution in a
questionable light. 
(you imply that there are persons of lesser substance!
ouch). Mockery is a demonstration of fear (1. you
cannot discern/reconstruct/replicate the real argument
and therefore resort to sardonic/demeaning responses
-- 2. you feel threatened in your [brittle] position
of security -- 3. you're a mob creature who enjoys
throwing stones). Were you aware of that?

It's all good :-)
time out,
Gazza
