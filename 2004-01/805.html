&gt; Well technically you are being completely passive and non-intrusive 
&gt; while "looking" at this gate.  That gate that belongs to whoever is 
&gt; actually giving off Photons or in a network sense could be broadcast 
&gt; messages that are configured incorrectly (or arguably correctly).  Think 
&gt; about photons along the same lines as broadcast messages and walla.  

It's not about passivity, it's about intent (which is related, but not
the same thing).

Breaking security (network or physical) requires a conscious decision
to trespass.  Everyone who does it knows they're breaking the law,
and they also know that the network operator or property owner won't
welcome their intrusion.  But they make a decision to do it anyway.

The act of making that decision turns their activity into an
illegal act.

They may explain it as, "I was only looking," or, "I was pointing
out your security holes," but that's just a bullshit rationalization.
In their own minds they know why the law is coming down on them.
Whether they "blame society" or admit that it was 100% their own
decisionmaking process which landed them in court is up to them, but
that's separate to the issue of whether they made a conscious
decision to carry out a criminal act regardless of the wishes of the
property owner.
