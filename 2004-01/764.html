&gt; &gt; The thing about a gate on the house is that you can tell if 
&gt; &gt; it's strong by looking
&gt; &gt; at it from a distance. No-one can tell if you looked at it 
&gt; &gt; from a security angle
&gt; &gt; when you walked by, and it isn't illegal to walk by and look 
&gt; &gt; at the gate, is it?
&gt; 
&gt; Well technically you are being completely passive and non-intrusive while
&gt; "looking" at this gate.  That gate that belongs to whoever is actually
&gt; giving off Photons or in a network sense could be broadcast messages that
&gt; are configured incorrectly (or arguably correctly).  Think about photons
&gt; along the same lines as broadcast messages and walla.  Someone that has
&gt; access to the sidewalk near this gate could easily listen to traffic that
&gt; the person who owns the gate is sending out, and again either analogy will
&gt; work (photons/messages). This doesn't make it illegal but what is illegal is
&gt; that if any action is taken directly against the gate because now you can
&gt; see (thanks to the photons) that the latch isn't even closed, or in the
&gt; network scenario has no password on it (or default).  I suppose if you were
&gt; blind there might be exceptions.

Ok.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; On a network, everything can be recorded, including any sort 
&gt; &gt; of casual 'looking'
&gt; &gt; at your 'front gate'. Hundreds of people 'push' on your 
&gt; &gt; network 'front gate' every
&gt; &gt; day. Wouldn't that be called 'Attempted Break-in' in the law 
&gt; &gt; book? How come we
&gt; &gt; only get excited about the people who push on the weak part 
&gt; &gt; of the gate?
&gt; 
&gt; Laziness / confidence / ignorance (possibly misplaced).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Which part of 'looking' is going to be called 'pushing' Can 
&gt; &gt; we have someone
&gt; &gt; charged for it, even if our defenses are adequate?
&gt; 
&gt; Whether the law agrees with me or not (I think it does), no part of looking
&gt; should ever IMO be consdidered unlawful.  It's the puching part after having
&gt; been sent messages (or photons) that I consider IMO to be unlawful.

So intercepting or monitoring the network for messages from your front gate is ok,
but connecting to it without authority is not.

Sounds ok to me, as long as I won't get pinged for accidents :) What about Korea
and China? 

What about the fact that the front gate has been beaten on for so long, that it's
considered normal that have the hinges groan all the time under the weight, and
all the time, the owner has made no attempt to uphold his right to an un-pushed
front gate? Does that Right-of-way rule still exist? (the one where a right of way
could be created across someone's property by a history of use of a certain path
or whatever, even though it encroached on property)

Michael
