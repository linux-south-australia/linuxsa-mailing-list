I'm sure we all saw the boxed vendor Linux CDs for
sale for $100s in the bookstores a few years back.
These disappeared after the bookstores didn't move
enough of them to justify the display space.

Today I went into the RMIT Bookshop.  Bought 3 CDs
of Fedora binaries for $20.  No display, just on
the shelves like paperbacks.  Asked at the counter,
they've sold one set a day during the holiday --
a nice consistent business which justifies a permanent
position on the shelves.  They don't stock too many
at any one time, as people won't buy an old release
and, unlike books, their supplier won't take back
unsold copies.  Interestingly, they don't hear in
advance of new releases (despite prospective release
dates being well known in the Linux community).

As well as Fedora they had Mandrake, Debian and
Slackware (which apparently they are not going
to stock again).

They've no idea how many to order for the busy
period at the start of semester.

Commoditisation of software in practice.  Sure
it's a uni bookshop and they are unique businesses,
and RMIT is a engineering-centered university.
But it is good sign of things to come all the same.

Cheers,
Glen
