Just read the news again SCO's latest lawsuit against Novell, and the
Lawsuit against them by CyberKnight in Oz (regarding fraud - making
groundless threats)
----------------------
Whats this gonna look like this time next year ?  Time to look in the
crystal ball ...

21 Jan 2005, Utah. SCO Group files suit against the US Legal System.

A spokesman for the SCO Group (Owner of all code ever written for Unix,
including all Unix like operating systems, with the exception of those
parts of MS-Windows which may be considered Unix-like), announced today
that they are taking the entire US legal system to court, in the wake of
the devastating rulings against them in recent cases.

"The US Courts have shown over and over again that they have
consistently failed to understand our position, with regards to the
ownership of code. We charge that the courts must have been manipulated
and/or biased by parties unknown in order to have reached these
outrageous decisions !."

SCO will be asking for an immediate injunction against the entire US
legal system, and will be seeking unspecified damages. Due to the
injunction against the legal system itself, this recursion infers that
the case shall be adjourned in perpetuity, or until a favourable
decision has been reached. Legal experts have advised that technically,
this case will have to be settled out of court, so to speak.

SCOX stock prices have surged back to their highs of 12 months ago on
the back of this news.
