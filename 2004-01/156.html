&gt; I strongly dislike PDF as an online format.

So propose another one.  PDF has been successful because it DOES work well 
and isn't too proprietory.

&gt; It requires that the whole document be downloaded before even Page 1 can
&gt; be viewed, & the layout is really setup for printing, not viewing.

No it doesn't - the progressive loading ones can view pages at a time.

Yep - Online's typically HTML.  But PDF rocks for printing or transporting.  
I deal with lots of PDF documents (most vendors like Cisco that I deal with
barely print anything anymore) and so being able to have a document as a
single unit that prints the same is great. I can save them as a single file
on my laptop to refer to when onsite.  I can print them, they have indexes
and are ugly like saving HTML to a series of files which often don't work
when not online.

&gt; So I set about trying to change it, & found that it couldn't be done 
&gt; because the font type/size was locked in the document. And of course you
&gt; can't even cut/paste the text from it into a word processor.

Not quite sure what you mean about a font being "too large".  The idea with 
PDF is that you as an author get to set how you want it to print.  It's NOT 
an editable format at all (well not much).  Usually however, I have success 
cutting and pasting - you just have to ask the PDF reader to do that.

&gt; The fact that it is a proprietary format is the icing on the cake.

Well, as I said above, propose a decent format to me that does the job as
well.  PDF isn't perfect but it's better than straight postscript (which has
all of the same issues above but has other issues like page sizes - Letter
vs A4 which the Americans don't seem to have figured out).  PDF works well
for what it's intended to do - which is as a readonly portable document
format.  It's not a wordprocessor editable document.

&gt; Let it die a quick death!

And go back to what?  Word documents?  They're much worse.  You've had a 
single bad experience.  I wish I could show you how bad straight Postscript 
and/or word documents used to be.
