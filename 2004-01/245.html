<H1>[OT?] UIS - Reorganising my document system</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I am in the process of moving my primary workstation from Win2K to OSX 
on a Powerbook.
This has prompted a review of the way I work and one thing that has 
annoyed me for a while is that email and other documents are 
organisationally too separate. What I mean by this is that I get 
communications from people in various forms; email, word docs, pdfs, 
txt etc. etc.
I tend to organise them in a directory structure that relates to the 
job, client etc. Email is not in this structure but has its own 
independent structure of folders/mailboxes which largely duplicates the 
structure I have for my other documents. I would like it to be all in a 
single unified structure.

Further to this I would like to associate metadata with each file so 
that I can record notes and other information against a file and use 
the metadata to search on various information. For example in an email 
the headers would just be used to generate some of the metadata. This 
might also allow me to "thread" files in a similar way that I get 
threads in my email. I may wish to "thread" on various criteria e.g. 
subject or senders name or company or date or job number etc.
A document may belong to more than one "thread" but there should only 
be one copy of the document.

I need a unified information system...  UIS - UIS Information System
(always wanted to use one of those recursive acronyms :-)

With such a system I would no longer need an email client _and_ an 
Explorer/Finder application as they would be replaced by, or one of 
them enhanced to become, a UIS browser. This would allow me to view all 
of my documents based on definable criteria e.g. by date, by keyword 
e.g. LinuxSA so I see all the e-mails from this list etc.

Anyone seen anything like this?

Perhaps I can just cat 1 &gt;/dev/UIS
and all will be rosy, but it may be more complicated than this.

If no one can set me straight, maybe this could be a fixit topic for 
the conference next week?

Regards
Andrew Braund
