&gt;Follow these simple rules and there's a good chance you wont need a
firewall or virus 
&gt;checker.

You've got to be joking...  AV software is an unfortunate necessity in the
Windows world.

Manual opening of email attachments is only one of many ways that a Windows
box can be broken by a virus/trojan/worm

&gt;Even if you're sure the email wasn't forged, don't open the attachment
unless you were
&gt;expecting them to send it to you, or unless they explain what's in the
attachment when they 
&gt;send it.

Just because you're able to verify that "mom and dad" intended to send you
the attachment and even if they can explain what's in it - that doesn't make
it not a trojan.  Especially if you've advised "mom and dad" them that they
don't need AV software.

&gt; You know... I think you're right.  But it might as well have been the

&gt; unqualified to do...

If there was one rule which you should follow to keep yourself safer it
would be never open an email attachment.  If you can't follow that one rule
then make never open an email attachment unless you know the person who sent
it to you, and you know that it really was sent by that person, and you know
that the person really meant to send it to you.

It's trivially easy to forge the sender of email, so just because the email
claims to be from "mom and dad", don't assume that it is.
You can believe that it really was from "mom and dad" if they start, "Dear
Prickles," or some other endearment which they always use.
Even if you're sure the email wasn't forged, don't open the attachment
unless you were expecting them to send it to you, or unless they explain
what's in the attachment when they send it.  If "mom and dad" send you an
email asking how you enjoyed your holiday in Paris, and include an
attachment without any explanation, you should consider that perhaps the
attachment is a virus that attaches itself to all outgoing email.
To be safe you should flick them back a message asking what's in it, and
wait for their reply before opening it.

Follow these simple rules and there's a good chance you wont need a firewall
or virus checker.
