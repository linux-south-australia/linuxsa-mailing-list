I think we've exchanged our views, so I'll just make a few more 
additional points then leave it at that.

&gt; For all your denigration of my reliance on law, what else should
&gt; I rely on?

Nothing. The law gives you the ability to vindictively seek revenge for 
wrong-doing... it doesn't prevent the problem from happening in the 
first place. So yes, go ahead and press charges. I can't stop you. I 
can only disagree with you.

I come from the perspective of engineering to avoid or risk mitigate 
the problem in the first place. An appropriate level of protection is 
where the effort to overcome security costs more than the gains from 
breaking in. Perhaps this is a military approach to information 
security, but I find the American "lawsuit" mentality bewilderingly 
inefficient.

&gt; It seems to me that without laws, the only way I can prevent
&gt; unauthorized access of my property is by NOT OWNING ANY
&gt; PROPERTY.

Data is not property. Data is not property. Repeat as a mantra until it 
sinks in.

The analogy of data as property is only useful in limited situations 
but it is not a full and complete correlation. The fact that the law 
currently takes this view is more reflective of traditional (ossified) 
perspectives than any higher truth.

Pointing to the law as justification for your views means agreeing with 
Richard Alston! For that matter, what do you think of the DMCA? It's 
law, baby!

&gt;&gt; For that matter, how was the bug discovered? Only by someone trying 
&gt;&gt; to break the security on the broken firewall!
&gt;
&gt; But how was it exploited?  By someone who knew they wouldn't be welcome
&gt; attacking it.

But how was it discovered? By the same means. Don't overlook the 
discovery phase or it's an invalid chain of reasoning.

&gt; I think the line is drawn when the police, showing all due diligence,
&gt; take reasonable steps to protect the information.  Steps which are
&gt; proportional to the sensitivity of the data.  Some police data would
&gt; be on their public website (contact details, press releases, etc).
&gt; Some would be behind a firewall.  Some would be behind multiple
&gt; firewalls fed by encrypted network links.

Exactly. So who is going to punish the State Government for _not_ 
having shown due diligence? Why is Darren Kruse being punished for 
having jiggled the door knob? How was anyone going to tell the State 
Government that they hadn't shown due diligence?

On one hand you argue that due diligence is needed, then on the other 
hand you argue against any and all methods by which this due diligence 
can be proven!

That's the crux of the matter.

&gt;&gt; In a war, all the laws are out of the window except for the Rules of 
&gt;&gt; Engagement
&gt;
&gt; We're not at war, Steve.  We're just living in a world where we
&gt; have to tolerate a small number of criminals.

I disagree with building weak infrastructure that can be blown away as 
soon as things get serious.

It saves a bit of effort now, but when banks start collapsing (bet that 
huge insurance company in the World Trade Centre wished they'd had an 
off-site backup!), the economy starts falling apart (oh wait!) and 
massive frauds on a large scale (oh wait, again!) become regular 
activities (wait, it is!) because of weak information security (hold 
on!), it's pretty damned apparent that something's wrong.

And when there is no way of testing and reporting problems, that closes 
off the only avenue for finding and fixing them.

In summary, I think this exchange shows the situation is more 
complicated than "private property, keep off!".
