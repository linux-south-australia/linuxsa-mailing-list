&gt; Indeed.  We're also needing cameramen with own-supplied firewire =
cameras
&gt; to come to LCA to make this happen - you can be a helper, with a
&gt; discounted registration!

PML...  Let me get this straight: You're actually asking for qualified
broadcast standard operators to come in with their own cameras and *PAY* =
for
the priveledge of *WORKING* through the conference?

I think I can safely say after many years of accredited work broadcast
through OPTUS VISION, channels 2, 7, 9, 10 and even ACE - as well as =
many
hundreds of other hours working on un-broadcast projects where the =
pjoject
was either straight to to video screen(s) and/or to tape - as everything
ranging from a tech, to a camera operator to a director to a producer - =
that
you have no idea how funny this statement is when you consider the value =
of
what your asking for and then add to it the fact that you want people to =
pay
YOU to do it...  *UNBELIEVABLE*
