Yes,
I'd second Enermax as good PSUs.  I've got one.

&gt; They have numerous problems with them, from fluculatiing voltiages to

&gt; I fully recommend getting rid of them ..... That's what I did, and
&gt; install a enermax

&gt; Subject: Reliable P4 system power supplies?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; G'day,
&gt; 
&gt; I've found that a set of 4 P4 systems with a moderately aggressive
&gt; nVidia card are unreliable, with the video card showing corruption on
&gt; the initial boot screen, locking up during operation, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; There's a reasonable suspicion that the power supplies are to blame
&gt; (350W power supply, but a fairly generic brand rather than a
&gt; high-profile manufacturer).
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to source some reliable power supplies and swap over the
&gt; supply.  A major concern is reliability: I would like to use a
&gt; brand/model which will last a long time.
&gt; 
&gt; I've looked briefly at the following brands:
&gt; 	- Codegen
&gt; 	- PC Power and Cooling
&gt; 	- Antec.
&gt; 
&gt; Any feedback on people's experiences with these brands is welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm interested in hearing about Adelaide dealers for these brands, and
&gt; also in hearing about other brands (and associated Adelaide
&gt; dealer(s)) that people like because of their quality and reliability.
&gt; 
&gt; cheers,
&gt;
