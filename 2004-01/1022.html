&gt; I  was hoping that some one can help me.
&gt;         Have done basic Linux/Unix training (mostly taught myself) and
&gt;         was wondering if anyone can suggest any courses that I can do
&gt;         to improve my skills.
&gt;         I have done a small amount of PHP scripting and was not too
&gt;         impressed with that so Further training and understanding of
&gt;         PHP scripting would be great.
&gt;         I have used basic Unix in my previous and also current
&gt;         workings.
&gt;         Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Searching through the archives of this mailing list, you'll see a number
of well-labelled advertisements by a company called IIT Training. You
can find out more about them from their website
(<A HREF="http://www.iit-training.com.au/">http://www.iit-training.com.au/</A>). There are a number of people on this
list that have attended their Hands-On Linux course and I'm sure they'd
give you an honest opinion of the course off-list.

I hope that this helps.

thx,
Matt
