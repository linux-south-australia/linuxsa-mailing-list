Sounds to me like you bought the wrong laptop.

Also note that powering down your HDD to early will actually use more power.
If it powers down too quickly it will always be powering back up again using
more power than if it was just left running. Maybe you can replace your HDD
with a slower RPM disk?

You should also be able to underclock your video card as well. GPU and RAM.
This will help. But if you underclock it too much, it will crash and burn.
You should be able to change your CAS/RAS latency up, which will slow your
RAM marginally, POSSIBLY giving you SOME SLIGHT power usage advantages.

You could always do as previously suggested, get an iBook. Or get a Centrino
based laptop. Or buy another laptop with a bigger battery. Some lappies have
the ability to have a 2nd battery attached.

If battery life is this important, it begs to be asked why you didn't think
of this when  you bought it?

Hi -

&gt; Seriously though, ACPI is known to be broken and strange on some 
&gt; laptops, even newer ones.  There's also other ways to increase battery 
&gt; life, such as spinning down your hard drive after no usage (hdparm 
&gt; does this afaik), dimming the LCD, and not using audio, all which seem 
&gt; to have more effect than reducing the processor speed.
I'm enticed by the dmesg claim that the CPU's burning 20 watts, and can be
reduced to 10 watts. On a 30 watt-hour battery, that's huge. In general, are
these sort of claims accurate?

LCD dimming works (/proc/acpi/toshiba/lcd), but only reduces screen power
usage from 5W to 2W.

Gwyn.
