&gt; The reasonable effort at security is to unplug your computer from the 
&gt; network. It's very easy and completely effective.

Effective does not mean efficient either.  Driving to work is 

extremely scary to me considering that you inherently trust 
everyone on the road not to swerve and hit you.  So the 
solution IMO isn't to just park your car and let it collect 
dust, or in your scenario for the net to unplug it.  Why even 
have it?  I see that you are not being security conscious by 
reading this email?
 
&gt; When you're plugged into the network, it's the same as being in a 
&gt; public place. People should be free to explore what is in 
&gt; public, and I 

That's quite interesting because I believe that Central 
Station in Sydney is public as well as let's say the train 
station here on North Terrace?  I would be very very 
irritated (to say the least) if someone started running their 
hands through my pockets.  Sure what might be in my pockets 
can be re-produced but it is still in my pants which in my 
opinion belongs to me wherever I am at regardless of it being 
public or private, and if I choose to share it with them then 
it is my right but it certaintly isn't their right to just 
start putting their hands in my pockets because I am in a 
public place.
