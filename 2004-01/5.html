&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Spare us your sob story!
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Did you notice there is a concession option?
&gt; 2. This is a very well priced conference considering
&gt; world prices for similar events.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy new year,
&gt; 
&gt; Gazza,

Gazza,

not all people have concession card, but still cant justify the money.
thats not a sob story, and its sodding rude to put it as such:)

yes, it may be well priced in comparison to other events, i'm not
denying that. i think the organisers are/have been doing a great job.

nonetheless, for many of us, its just part of the budget that won't
stretch. hard to explain to kids that father xmas decided the xmas funds
would be much less this year so daddy or mummy could attend lca;)

i just wish it was possible that such events could be more open to the
greater, struggling, coalface type community - to whom even 99 dollars
is a hefty whack. i know too many people on austudy who would prefer to 
eat, for example....

this is NOT a criticism of geoff, michael, david et al. i know shaun
didnt mean it that way either. its just we need to be aware of the
disparity in the community with info tech, and info tech related
events, and those who can afford them.

certainly, the organisers have all been happy to help
computerbank/itshare sa whenever they could. they are community aware.
david has contacted us and is trying to help organise SOMETHING. the
organisers made sure they got sufficient sponsorship for one rep from
each state. still, there is so much disparity.

but shaun, as coordinator of computerbank/itshare, is certainly even
more aware of the disparity issue. its the raison d'etre of what we do.
scarcely a sob story, no? a sob story would be whinging WITHOUT doing
anything.
