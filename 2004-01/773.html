SCO Announces ANZ Availability of SCO Intellectual Property License

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Sydney, January 20 2004

The SCO Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: SCOX), the owner of the UNIXR operating
system and a leading provider of UNIX-based solutions, today announced
the availability of the SCO Intellectual Property License to companies
and organisations in Australia and New Zealand.

The company began the worldwide roll out of the license in the UK,
France and other European countries last week, and plans to make the
license available to many more countries and regions by February 1.

The SCO Intellectual Property (IP) License permits the use of SCO's
intellectual property, in binary form only, as contained in Linux
distributions.  By purchasing the license, customers are properly
compensating SCO for the UNIX source code, derivative UNIX code and
other UNIX-related intellectual property and copyrights owned by SCO as
it is currently found in Linux.

Pricing:
The SCO IP License is currently available at introductory pricing of
AUD$999.00 per server processor and AUD$285.00 per desktop processor.
The company is also offering the license to embedded device
manufacturers that use Linux to run their devices.

In addition to extending the license to customers worldwide, the company
also announced that the license will shortly be made available through
select SCO resellers.  SCO resellers who are interested in obtaining
more information about providing the SCO IP License to their customers
can contact SCO at <A HREF="mailto:anz_info@sco.com">anz_info@sco.com</A> after February 1, 2004.

"While we have identified several problem areas at issue within Linux,
we also want to be fair to customers and allow them to continue using
Linux and our intellectual property unencumbered," said Chris Sontag,
senior vice president and general manager of SCOsource, the intellectual
property licensing and protection division of The SCO Group, Inc.  "We
believe the SCO IP License helps customers satisfy the legal
requirements to continue using SCO's UNIX intellectual property in Linux
in a forthright way while properly compensating the company for use of
its property."

Kieran O'Shaughnessy, SCO's Regional General Manager, Australia and New
Zealand, said he will begin briefing the company's local distributors
this week regarding the SCO IP License's introduction.

"The SCO IP License helps organisations in Australia and New Zealand to
protect and leverage the investments they have made in Linux while
providing the means for them to continue day-to-day business without
interruption," he said.

Availability:
Commercial business end users of Linux, based on the 2.2 kernel and
later, that are interested in more information or in purchasing the SCO
IP License in Australia or New Zealand can call +61 2 9440 7577 or
e-mail SCO at <A HREF="mailto:anz_info@sco.com.">anz_info@sco.com.</A>
