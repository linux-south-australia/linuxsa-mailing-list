&gt; It is against the law to look under the curtain! 

Isn't that what the law is for?  Isn't the law of trespass an
acknowledgement that security isn't perfect, that private individuals
can't prevent other individuals from trespassing if the trespassers
are determined enough, and that therefore the law exists to use the
power of the state to punish those who don't take the hint from
property owners...?

Do you believe the laws of trespass on private property should be
abolished to make them consistent with your view of network security?

I can't stop you from breaking into my house.  If I build a steel
door, you can use a gas-axe.  You can use explosives.  You can
rip security mesh off its hinges.  You can use an angle grinder to
cut through bars I might put on my windows.  You have all sorts of
options, because physical security isn't perfect.

So we have laws:  If you take advantage of the fact that physical
security isn't perfect, and go somewhere where you aren't supposed
to go, expect to end up in jail.

Replace the word "physical" with "network" in the paragraph above
and the rule still holds.

I don't care whether my network security is 100% bulletproof;  I choose
to connect to networks.  I shouldn't have to isolate myself from the
electronic world to stop trespassers, any more than I should need to
isolate myself from the physical world to protect my physical property.

Stupid argument.  It's already been, gone, and been settled.  Why are
we having this discussion?
