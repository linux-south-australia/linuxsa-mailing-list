&gt; Nothing. The law gives you the ability to vindictively seek revenge for 
&gt; wrong-doing... 

Actually in this case, you'd be committing a criminal act if you hacked
someone's systems. The Police would be obligated to press charges and
determine the charges to be pressed regardless of the victim's thoughts on
the matter. What you're talking about is the torts follow-up to a criminal
trial where compensation is determined by a court which decides the level of
injury to the victim caused by the perpetrator of the offence.

&gt; I come from the perspective of engineering to avoid or risk mitigate 
&gt; the problem in the first place. An appropriate level of protection is 
&gt; where the effort to overcome security costs more than the gains from 
&gt; breaking in. Perhaps this is a military approach to information 
&gt; security, but I find the American "lawsuit" mentality bewilderingly 
&gt; inefficient.

Again, you're talking torts, we're talking criminal law. Totally different
mindset, terms and consequences from that. I'm starting to see where some
misunderstandings have arisen.

&gt; Data is not property. Data is not property. Repeat as a mantra until it 
&gt; sinks in.

&gt; The analogy of data as property is only useful in limited situations 
&gt; but it is not a full and complete correlation. The fact that the law 
&gt; currently takes this view is more reflective of traditional (ossified) 
&gt; perspectives than any higher truth.

Last I checked that regardless of whether you agreed with the 'mantra' you
mention above, in the eyes of the law, data IS property.

&gt; Pointing to the law as justification for your views means agreeing with 
&gt; Richard Alston! For that matter, what do you think of the DMCA? It's 
&gt; law, baby!

The fact that what he's saying IS law is irrelevent. He's stating his views
on how data (particularly sensitive data) should be dealt with and the law
happens to agree with him. You may as well be saying that you believe
dropping something should result in it falling up rather than down because
it's better.

&gt; Exactly. So who is going to punish the State Government for _not_ 
&gt; having shown due diligence? Why is Darren Kruse being punished for 
&gt; having jiggled the door knob? How was anyone going to tell the State 
&gt; Government that they hadn't shown due diligence?

&gt; On one hand you argue that due diligence is needed, then on the other 
&gt; hand you argue against any and all methods by which this due diligence 
&gt; can be proven!

&gt; That's the crux of the matter.

No it's not. He's arguing for an alternative discovery method than yours,
not the absence of one. I would have thought that as an engineer who has to
advocate solutions, you would have ben cautioned against Straw Man Fallacies
like that. A cheap and ultimately invalid way of arguing your point used
almost exclusively by politicians because almost everyone else has figured
out it doesn't work.

&gt; And when there is no way of testing and reporting problems, that closes 
&gt; off the only avenue for finding and fixing them.

Yet again you patently show the invalidity of your argument by advocating
your solution as the only one and that anyone not using it must be doing
nothing when that's palpably not the case.

And while I'm at it, I'll repond to your earier email:

&gt; Nothing about crypto prevents it from being a broadcast medium.

True but I wasn't referring to cryto here. I was referring to how limiting
public networks limits the speed at which information can be exchanged. For
example, in a recent operation, a website updatable by any of the coppers on
duty was set-up so they could update details changing constantly whilst the
operation was in effect. It was viewable by all involved at once so that if
you needed an update on the situation as a whole (spanning three states at
any one time), you coudl get it without going through comms to find out the
latest info told by someone who might not have the whole picture having gone
through his s/sergeant and sergeant to do so. 

Sure it wasn't terribly secure but it was quick. I don't deny that it's
insecure by nature but several incidents which would have blown up in the
past weren't allowed to do so because people were updated with all the
latest info as quickly as possible and decisions could be made must faster.

&gt; SECMAN 3 isn't for sysadmins. I presume you mean you're an analyst in a 
&gt; non-technical area.

Intelligence Analyst with a BSc. majoring in chemistry. My quals aren't in
computers at all. If you want to know how to blow something up,
however...........

&gt; But you shouldn't rely on this, because there will be people who hack 
&gt; in and don't get busted. You have a duty of care to ensure that 
&gt; sensitive information is adequately protected, without saying "but 
&gt; but... we have a LAW that says you can't!".

This was probably always going to happen given that you're not a lawyer or
in justice at all but you're missing the point of laws. They're not
protections but deterrants. They're meant to make the perps think before
breaking them. Then if they make the decision to do so and get caught,
they're in trouble. 

There's little physically stopping you from breaking into a pub to steal
alcohol so why not do it and then grab a random patrol on the road and tell
them "I broke into a pub and borroweda little alcohol and you didn't see me.
Your protections in place to prevent people from doing this are inadequate.
Just remember I did it for your information and have no interest in the
alcohol. Here it is. See ya!"

&gt; So back to the original point... I would far rather be told of security 
&gt; problems by helpful hackers, than to discover weaknesses in malicious 
&gt; circumstances. I'm informed by the former, victimised by the latter.

So there are no hackers out there who would hack in and tell you about it to
give you the impression that they'd been helpful  whilst using the
information for other purposes? You make an enormous assumption there, mate.
I wouldn't.

Your argument here rests on the benevolence of hackers in totality. Since it
doesn't exist (yes Virginia, there are people who would tell you one thing
and do another), why would you take the risk? You may well be informed by
'helpful hackers' but how about those who only appear helpful? What
processes have you put in place to deal with them?
