&gt; Dude... While I respect the fact that you have a right to not like
&gt; American's, their version of Democracy and/or their Presidents tendancy to
&gt; invade any Country that won't do what he tells them to do/when he tells them
&gt; to do it/the WAY he tells them to do it - how about toning down abit here?
&gt; :-)

That is actually almost as irrelevant as the original posting. The 
circumstances under which the US President can/will engage the US in a 
'police' action are not that broad, and the level of perceived provocation 
has to be high. To actually declare war requires the approval of Congress 
and the level of perceived provocation has to be even higher.

A more correct answer would have been that the US has been very successful 
in 'foisting' some of the core ideas in their legal system on other 
countries through various means. In addition, in practical terms, large US 
companies tend to have the resources to go after you using the legal 
system in your country and individuals tend not to have the resources to 
defend themselves, so the result is the same.

The original poster simply has his head in the sand.
