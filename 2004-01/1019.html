Hi Romana,

&gt; signed by linus-hence must keepable
&gt;
to be kept for life!

Oh, and don't forget, also signed by Bdale including the Debian spiral 
&lt;G&gt;

I have double checked the memory configuration, 2M onboard + 3 x 2M 
chips gives me 8 meg maxed out. The ram is very different from any 
others I have seen so chances of getting larger chips is really 
doubtful.

I tried the other drives and was shocked when the 12G was identified 
but it didn't seem to have an OS on it so have no idea if it was being 
addressed. I joked that I should leave it in and son agreed, "just 
think of the brag value". Mmm, 486, 8 M RAM, 12 G drive. Seems a bit 
out of proportion ;-)

Besides, with those two signatures who cares about the specifications, 
I already have attention - perhaps I could sell it to DSL?

 Cheers,
 Ian
