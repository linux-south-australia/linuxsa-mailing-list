&gt;Any Clarkconnect users on the list:

Yup.  It's been handling my DSL connection for the last 18mo or so,
mainly because I'm too lazy to setup a custom box myself :)


&gt;I am currently looking at Clarkconnect <A HREF="http://www.clarkconnect.com">http://www.clarkconnect.com</A>
&gt;From what I could see it's a RH clone with pretty much html UI for
&gt;management

Pretty much, slightly modified (apt is used for updates etc) but it's a
fairly standard RH installation under the hood.


&gt;I was wondering if it's all that different to a well setup RH 
&gt;box? (of which I am incapable of achieving)

Not really, perhaps a little light on in the way of software, but
that's better for a gateway box anyway, less is good. Being a standard RH
install underneath you can add extras anyway.  Think apt repositories ;)


&gt;Also, it states it only needs 1gb of disk but how much is left?
&gt;What is included? ftp/web/php etc.

df from my CC box @ home (I manually partitioned it during install):

Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda2             5.1G  444M  4.5G   9% /
/dev/hda1              97M  9.1M   83M  10% /boot
none                  188M     0  188M   0% /dev/shm
/dev/hdb1             8.0G  203M  7.4G   3% /var


&gt;Another alternative is ipcop but I haven't found the 
&gt;requirements for it yet. Anyone have experiencer with this?

It's not bad, but not quite as customizable as CC, very much a 
bare bones firewall, and a good one at that.
