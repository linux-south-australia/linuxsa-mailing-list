&gt; &gt; Indeed.  We're also needing cameramen with own-supplied firewire cameras

&gt; PML...  Let me get this straight: You're actually asking for qualified
&gt; broadcast standard operators to come in with their own cameras and *PAY* for
&gt; the priveledge of *WORKING* through the conference?

I don't think that's what Ryan's asking for.  If he was wanting
qualified broadcast standard operators, he probably wouldn't have
asked on the LinuxSA list :-).  (although Ryan's apparently found one
professional if that's what he was looking for :-).

With due respect to the other comments on this thread about LCA not
being cheap at $275, firewire cameras are (relatively) cheap consumer
items these days (&lt;$1k).  I presume these "cheap" ones don't count as
the sort of equipment that a "qualified broadcast standard operator"
would be using.

I think Ryan was hoping to reach people who:
- would be coming (or would like to come) to LCA anyway
- wouldn't mind paying less than what they would otherwise pay to
  attend the conference
- happen to own a firewire camera
- wouldn't mind pointing that camera at a speaker for a few hours each
  day

Sounds like a good deal to me.
