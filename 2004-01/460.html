&gt;&gt; So it's near the end of the first day of linux.conf.au's mini 
&gt;&gt; conference. There's a good vibe here - relaxed yet interesting. The 
&gt;&gt; conference packs are very well done, and I'm particularly impressed 
&gt;&gt; with Dan Shearer's instanta-demo CD. :)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I noticed something curious... nearly all the seminars I find 
&gt;&gt; interesting are South Australian speakers. Either we have a lot of 
&gt;&gt; them, or we're a very interesting bunch of people. :)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So far I've seen a couple of people I know... Romana Challans, and
&gt;the &gt; elusive David Lloyd disappearing around a corner. I'm sure I'll
&gt;meet &gt; more people (for that 2 seconds and 3d image!) as the main
&gt;conference &gt; kicks in.
&gt;&gt; 
I only got to meet people sorted by surname between H and K
(inclusive)..If quantity counts...

&gt;&gt; Wish you were here, etc etc.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Steve. :)
&gt;
&gt;nice finally meeting you steve:) yes, dsl was in run amok mode, a v
&gt;busy man:))
&gt;
&gt;i kept wondering if i should give out bags to poor emacs users,
&gt;burdened by their bad editor as they were...but i did anyway, with only
&gt;a small payout to pete gossner to be had for it...
&gt;
&gt;actually, there were times when it was so busy, we didnt have time to
&gt;read what people used! pete did notice his list was half and half emacs
&gt;v vi, might examine at more leisure on next help desk stint:)


Yeah and a surprising number of Xemacs users at that..
Have to note that Vi definitely was the flavour in the Debconf..
(which is excellent .. the conf and Vi :)

I don't think I have ever seen so many lappys in one place.. you can get
wireless in the lecture rooms if you stand up the back face SW and hold
your lappy over your head.... Well I am assuming that was what that guy
was doing ...

&gt;
&gt;gosh lca is FUN - please peeps- if you can, GET THERE!!!!!!!!!
&gt;

Yeah ...girls get the big water pistols :)

&gt;r, tired but had a blast (and saw linus too!)

Nah that was his body double... When the real Linus is about there is
this music and great lighting.... 

Pete
