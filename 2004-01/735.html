If you can make it happen, sure.

&gt; If that's the best you can do then you can stop now, because the law
&gt; doesn't agree with you.  It never has.

It used to be the law that the Earth was flat. I think it's still the 
law that women wearing jeans can't play guitar at mid-day.

Being the law doesn't make it right... it's just the common consensus 
at that point, defined by people who don't really know what the hell 
they're doing. Seen a judge that knows anything about computers yet?

That's why the law is continually revised and updated.

&gt; That's total crap.  When you're plugged in to the network, parts that
&gt; you wish to make public are in a public space, and parts which you
&gt; wish to keep private are in a private space.

If you can make it happen, go for it. If you can't make it happen, we 
need to know as fast as possible before someone really malicious comes 
along.

By punishing non-malicious hackers, we are depriving ourselves of early 
warnings of insecurities that _do_ exist, regardless of how many laws 
there are about it.

Wasn't there a law that made PI = 3? Computer security laws are the 
same kind of wish fulfilment. Can't legislate reality!
