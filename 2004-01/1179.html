&gt; Howdy,

&gt; Anybody clued up here on fixing dead pixels (as in, single pixel lines
&gt; down the monitor display some random color instead of the video
&gt; content) with laptop LCD screens?  I've had various laptops in the past
&gt; that end up developing this problem, and repair places always insist
&gt; that the LCD is completely stuffed and needs to be swapped, and at
&gt; usually some insane cost.

Yes, this is correct.

&gt; I'm sure in some cases though it may be as simple as a loose cable
&gt; or something, as moving the display can make the problem go away.

Not if it's individual pixels.  I see that you're talking about lines,
but I suspect the cause is similar.

&gt; Right now I've got a G4/500 Powerbook I'm trying to sell, and minus
&gt; some dead pixels on the right hand side, it's a great machine, still
&gt; runs software at blazing speeds, and has no other issues.  For
&gt; obvious reasons though, I've had no luck selling it at all.

Basically, there are two kinds of problems:

1.  Problems on the panel.  See above.  The panels aren't repairable
    as far as I know.

2.  Cable problems.  You're hoping that it's that.  I don't think
    that's the case.  I do have a laptop (well, Yana does) which
    demonstrates this problem.  It requires me to take apart the
    display every year or so and wobble the connectors.  The symptoms
    are dropout of some pixels across the entire screen, in a more or
    less uniform way.

Based on what you say, I fear you have a stuffed panel.  If anybody
else can point to a solution, I'd be interested in hearing about it.
