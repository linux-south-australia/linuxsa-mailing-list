Who started this thread? I did.
Why, 3 reasons-
1. I don't like Bigpong's tactics as the other ISPs don't force you to
buy their gear. ('nuff said by all, no need to rehash)
2. I have a lot of private customers that want to use Bigpond because of
the brand name. Its wasting their money and that sh!ts me.
OK, its not my money but its the principle.
3. Here in Alice we don't have the same choice of players in the ISP
market that you guys do down there. Most of the ISPs that offer ADSL
have appeared only recently here and have no brand recognition so most
people only recognise Telstra, Ozemail,etc.

&gt; &gt; Even though Im no expert on this I really think BPA have a right to sell a
&gt; &gt; package as such and the package is inclusive of 1 of 2 types of modems. They
&gt; &gt; arent sending you to a supplier or asking you to buy specific modems they
&gt; &gt; are saying heres the deal 100 years+first born and this modem for 1000/month
&gt; &gt; take it or leave it.
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly. I don't understand why people bother complaining about this
&gt; kind of jazz. Really, I don't. If punters don't like what Peter the Shoe
&gt; Peddler's selling, then said punter goes elsewhere. Is it that hard to
&gt; fathom?
&gt; 
&gt; Seeing as the product isn't exactly the bees knees anyhow, why, but why,
&gt; would *ANYONE* waste valuable heartbeats arguing the point? If they want
&gt; to sell an overpriced product, let 'em.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; And whilst it sounds silly they are not obliged to sell you anything if they
&gt; &gt; dont want.
&gt; 
&gt; Or, conversely and more importantly, Joe Punter isn't obliged to by
&gt; anything from anyone. 'Round here, if I don't like the shoes, I bugger
&gt; off and find me a better peddler
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; btw : take it easy on the flames plz
&gt; 
&gt; Heh :-) Nothing to flame about here. I'm more frazzled by the fact that
&gt; we're here writing installments to Telstra's Legal Position in Relation
&gt; to Bundling ADSL Modems (coming to a cinema near you) at half-passed
&gt; twelve on a Friday night.
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder what the average fitness level of LinuxSA'ers is. I wonder when
&gt; the last time aforementioned Mr Average went for a run, played a game of
&gt; footy or just got out of there chair and away from their monitor.
&gt; 
&gt; Christ! *WHO* the hell starts these threads?!
