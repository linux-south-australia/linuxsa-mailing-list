&gt;&gt; ...just E-Mailed me a copy of everything on my
&gt;&gt;  desktop; in a ZIP file.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Do you have anything unusual on your desktop?
&gt; (Maybe the contents of the zip are generic windows
&gt; XP desktop contents?)
Yes, I do/did. (Which was why I panicked.)

What I found interesting though was that when I had dissconnected my modem
from the swtich - I removed some of these icons and then saved the zip file
AGAIN to the desktop and unzipped it - it seemed to show all the CURRENT
contents of the desktop.

What's even MORE interesting is that I've looked for all the files that
MyDoom and other species of bugs I'm aware of leave as calling cards - and
can't find a single solitary one...  No Trojan's no Worms - nothing...

(Talk about perplexing!!!)  Consequntly (unless someone here has heard about
this particular zip file with no exe's or other executables on it that I
ran) then I'll have to conclude this was a wildly elaborate hoax that I fell
for.


&gt; Could this be the work of a virus on your machine?
&gt; Do you have a virus checker, is it up to date, is it
&gt; running? Have you run a scan since this happenned?
I DO. I run Trend Micro's latest version of PC-Cillin and I update it on a
DAILY basis.  It showed nothing - and still shows nothing...  I also ran the
online checker, and it too shows nothing.

Darned perplexing the whole thing is... Darned perplexing.
