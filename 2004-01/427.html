"He said he'd feel famous when he was recognised in a fish market."




Probably needs a line to cast out and then catch the fish in the first 
place to  *take* to the fish market ?

I am still sure the quote has a cryptic ring to it...
Like, why would someone feel famous just by going to a fish market to 
buy fish ?
Please....

&gt;Does Linus, in fact, eat fish..............

&gt;&gt;&gt;When Linus was at the AUUG conference, a few years ago, he said he didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;feel famous because he was only recognised in computer conferences.
&gt;&gt;&gt;He said he'd feel famous when he was recognised in a fish market.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I propose we hold a happening.  I'd like as many people as can be roped
&gt;&gt;&gt;in, to go to the fish market at a time when we know Linus will be there,
&gt;&gt;&gt;approach him, greet him by name, and leave.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If I was there, I'd do it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Someone will probably have to ask him to go to the fish market as a favor.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;"Say Linus, we're all out of fish for dinner, etc. and all the helpers 
&gt;&gt;are occupied, etc."
