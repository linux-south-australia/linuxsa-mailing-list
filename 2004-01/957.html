Yep..Been running CC for the last 18 months. Currently running version 2.0
Out of the box it comes with FTP server, Apache, PHP etc

I installed MySQL as well. My current install of CC is in Standalone mode as
I now have my modem/router doing the authentication, but is equally at home
as a Gateway device
Official and unofficial updates are here
<A HREF="http://www.clarkconnect.org/webapp/updates.jsp">http://www.clarkconnect.org/webapp/updates.jsp</A>

Pretty much anything that you can run on Redhat will run on CC and it works
well out of the box. It's VERY easy to set up. Friend of mine that knows
NOTHING about Linux got his CC box up and running.

Subject: Peoples experience with Clarkconnect?


Any Clarkconnect users on the list:

I am currently looking at Clarkconnect <A HREF="http://www.clarkconnect.com">http://www.clarkconnect.com</A>
&gt;From what I could see it's a RH clone with pretty much html UI for
management
I was wondering if it's all that different to a well setup RH box? (of which
I am incapable of achieving)

Also, it states it only needs 1gb of disk but how much is left?
What is included?
ftp/web/php etc.

Another alternative is ipcop but I haven't found the requirements for it
yet. Anyone have experiencer with this?

The reason for my possible move from freesco is it's inability to run poptop
(or m inability to set it up) people have done so but I can't seem to do it.
I even read the documentation (cough).

Anyway all info appreciated

Evan
