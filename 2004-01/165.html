Thanks to all who have replied. Here are a few things I have learned:

1. There seem to be 3 types of modems: hard (real) modems,
controllerless modems, and soft modems. Controllerless modems have
more hardware than soft modems but are still in reality soft modems
because they need special software to run them. You need to be careful
what you ask for because to some suppliers seem to think a
controllerless modem is a real modem.

2. Anything with a Rockwell or Conexant chipset is probably (perhaps
"certainly") a controllerless or soft modem. 

3. Several people mentioned free drivers from linuxant.com. They might
have been free once but not anymore. (They do supply a free version,
but it is limited to 14k bps). 

David Fitch mentioned 3 cheap, apparently hardware, modems he found:

&gt;"Discovery 56K Hardware Int PCI  Rockwell chipset" RRP $35
&gt;"DLink DFM-560I 56K PCI Hardware Modem" RRP approx $50
&gt;"Dynalink PCI 56K F/D Hardware Modem" RRP approx $40

This URL for the DLink modem says it uses the Rockwell chipset and
requires Windows:

<A HREF="http://www.dlink.com.au/products/modems/dfm560i/">http://www.dlink.com.au/products/modems/dfm560i/</A>

Based on that, I suspect all 3 modems mentioned above are
controllerless, not hard, modems.

It seems it is hard to get a hard modem for under about $150. 

In case anyone else has to go through the same procedure, here is what
I did:

Rather than fork out for an expensive modem (since it'll only be for
work once I get ADSL going), I downloaded the 14k-limited driver
from Linuxant. It worked! And while it did indeed seem to enforce an
*average* limit of 14k bps (I did a whole pile of downloads and
averaged 1500 bytes/s), this was in fact faster than the same set of
downloads in Windows on my supposedly 45k bps line. So I suspect I
have a crummy throughput with my ISP (well it is only $1/hour with Big
Button), so I might as well stick with the (free) 14k bps limited
version. 

I had to do one thing to get it going: after dialing, the modem must
have had trouble with the dial tones because it kept returning the
"BUSY" signal after dialing. I fixed this by changing the dialing
string from "ATDT" to "ATX1DT". This causes the modem to not try to
determine whether the phone at the other end is busy.

(This was with a controllerless modem. Linuxant have drivers for soft
modems also).


I must say this whole process has made installing Linux a pain and
would dishearten many novices. Since the linuxant 14k versions are
free, perhaps they should be included in the standard Linux
distributions (perhaps they are).

Thanks again for everyone's help.
