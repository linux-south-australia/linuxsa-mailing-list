&gt; Subject: SCO ANZ Announces IP License for Linux
&gt; X-cid: caldera.55667.2
&gt; 
&gt; SCO Announces ANZ Availability of SCO Intellectual Property License
&gt; 
&gt; FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
&gt; Sydney, January 20 2004
&gt; 
&gt; The SCO Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: SCOX), the owner of the UNIXR operating
&gt; system and a leading provider of UNIX-based solutions, today announced
&gt; the availability of the SCO Intellectual Property License to companies
&gt; and organisations in Australia and New Zealand.
&gt; 
&gt; The company began the worldwide roll out of the license in the UK,
&gt; France and other European countries last week, and plans to make the
&gt; license available to many more countries and regions by February 1.
&gt; 
&gt; The SCO Intellectual Property (IP) License permits the use of SCO's
&gt; intellectual property, in binary form only, as contained in Linux
&gt; distributions.  By purchasing the license, customers are properly
&gt; compensating SCO for the UNIX source code, derivative UNIX code and
&gt; other UNIX-related intellectual property and copyrights owned by SCO as
&gt; it is currently found in Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; Pricing:
&gt; The SCO IP License is currently available at introductory pricing of
&gt; AUD$999.00 per server processor and AUD$285.00 per desktop processor.
&gt; The company is also offering the license to embedded device
&gt; manufacturers that use Linux to run their devices.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to extending the license to customers worldwide, the company
&gt; also announced that the license will shortly be made available through
&gt; select SCO resellers.  SCO resellers who are interested in obtaining
&gt; more information about providing the SCO IP License to their customers
&gt; can contact SCO at <A HREF="mailto:anz_info@sco.com">anz_info@sco.com</A> after February 1, 2004.
&gt; 
&gt; "While we have identified several problem areas at issue within Linux,
&gt; we also want to be fair to customers and allow them to continue using
&gt; Linux and our intellectual property unencumbered," said Chris Sontag,
&gt; senior vice president and general manager of SCOsource, the intellectual
&gt; property licensing and protection division of The SCO Group, Inc.  "We
&gt; believe the SCO IP License helps customers satisfy the legal
&gt; requirements to continue using SCO's UNIX intellectual property in Linux
&gt; in a forthright way while properly compensating the company for use of
&gt; its property."
&gt; 
&gt; Kieran O'Shaughnessy, SCO's Regional General Manager, Australia and New
&gt; Zealand, said he will begin briefing the company's local distributors
&gt; this week regarding the SCO IP License's introduction.
&gt; 
&gt; "The SCO IP License helps organisations in Australia and New Zealand to
&gt; protect and leverage the investments they have made in Linux while
&gt; providing the means for them to continue day-to-day business without
&gt; interruption," he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Availability:
&gt; Commercial business end users of Linux, based on the 2.2 kernel and
&gt; later, that are interested in more information or in purchasing the SCO
&gt; IP License in Australia or New Zealand can call +61 2 9440 7577 or
&gt; e-mail SCO at <A HREF="mailto:anz_info@sco.com.">anz_info@sco.com.</A>
