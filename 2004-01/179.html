&gt; I write straight PostScript for breakfast and don't understand what
&gt; you are complaining about.  I particularly don't understand why you
&gt; draw a qualitative distinction between PostScript and PDF -- they're
&gt; almost the same.

David, I probably didn't explain myself well - I actually have nothing 
against PS (I have written stuff in PS too - esp involving printing from 
billing systems etc) but:

Before PDF (Mid-Early '90s)a lot of companies I used to deal with (eg. Sun,
SGI etc) used to ship documents as PS, mostly built from FrameMaker, 
InterLeaf, etc.  (The stuff created out of TeX stuff usually worked but not 
always).

Unfortunately a lot of PS had the following problems:
- it was formatted as letter and was difficult to print in Oz on A4 [there 
were ways around this but sometimes they worked and sometimes they didn't 
and often required handediting the PS]
- it often was PS that wasn't liked by some printers (even though we had a 
range of different printers at Camtech at the time from HP, Sun and Apple 
there were often documents that wouldn't print).  Again there were often 
ways around this but sometimes they worked, sometimes they didn't.   
Sometimes the font problem was too great.

Now PDF has solved these device and paper size problems.  So life is happier 
and better.  Even if all it's done is wrap the PS up into an easy to use 
package.
