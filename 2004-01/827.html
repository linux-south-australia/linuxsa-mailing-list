Most of this has been said before but I find his points about the
community's 'chip' and 'with us or against us' attitude really resonated
with me. This quote in particular says a lot in my opinion:

"Especially unhelpful is the "who cares about X" attitude (where X is
unsupported hardware, nonexistent game availability, complicated multimedia
support, or anything else that Linux has or is perceived to have problems
doing). Just because someone wants to do something that you don't, it
doesn't mean that what they want to do is less important. 

I had a number of comments when I complained that I had great trouble
getting my DVD player on my laptop to view commercial films, comments that
essentially said "Why are you watching DVDs on your laptop?" Some even
suggested that I buy a dedicated portable DVD player. Leaving aside the
hassle of having yet another piece of electronics to drag through security
if I want to watch a movie on a plane, these kinds of comments are the worst
kind of evasive nonsense, i.e., Linux doesn't currently do something as
easily as Windows, so attack the need to do it at all."

Thoughts?
