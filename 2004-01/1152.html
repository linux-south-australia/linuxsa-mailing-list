I agree with this
for the general Windows consumer they need something like Zonealarm
It firewalls in by app so they can sit there all they like knocking to get
out but unless you let it it cant.

Incoming f/walls dont achive much if you're not running services on open
ports.

&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;Hi David
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;I've noticed people are talking about your Billion as a possible
&gt;  &gt;security problem.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, they are....
&gt;
&gt;  &gt;Ok, even if the Billion IS the problem, they have to get through that
&gt;  &gt;AND Windows XP.
&gt;
&gt; They don't have to compromise anything that the billion is designed to
&gt; do.
&gt;
&gt;  &gt;Presuming they DID get thru the Billion easily, then they
&gt;  &gt;have to get
&gt;  &gt;through Windows XP.
&gt;  &gt; Two ways to do this:
&gt;  &gt;    1. Vulnerability in the OS
&gt;  &gt;    2. Trojan/Virus/Malicious program on WinXP letting them connect.
&gt;
&gt; In the majority of cases, Windows machines are *not* cracked by people
&gt; "breaking in" because they lacked a firewall stopping incoming
&gt; connections reaching a machine.  Windows machines are cracked because
&gt; the user is tricked into running trojan code, or an operating
&gt; system/application flaw is exploited via ie/oe and/or AV software is not
&gt; up to date.
&gt;
&gt; Once a machine is compromised, trojan code is free to make outgoing
&gt; connections to the world.  Mass-market 'firewall' NAT routers do not
&gt; block any outgoing connections out-of-the-box.  This is by design, so
&gt; that things "just work."
&gt;
&gt; You can have a super-whizz-bang Linux firewall with lovingly
&gt; hand-crafted rulesets.  You can reject packets from naughty people
&gt; trying to break in to services that aren't even running on your machine.
&gt; In the end, you're still going to let web and email through, ie/oe are
&gt; still going to be compromised and your firewall didn't protect you like
&gt; you thought it would.
&gt;
&gt; Don't get me wrong, firewalls have their place.  But firewalls do not
&gt; equal security.
&gt;
&gt; Admittedly, a firewall configured to block outgoing connections except
&gt; those specifically required will prevent many trojans from delivering a
&gt; keystrokes/backdoors from the infected machine.  However, this is still
&gt; not a solution in itself.  If anything, the "my firewall will protect
&gt; me" belief causes people to be lax about the important things:
&gt;
&gt;  - <A HREF="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com</A> configure Windows Update to notify
&gt; or automatically download updates unless you have a really good reason
&gt; not to.  (Control Panel, System, Windows Update tab)
&gt;  - Keep AV software up to date
&gt;  - Mozilla firebird
&gt;  - Spy-Bot
&gt;
&gt;  &gt;However, you may as well fix both these possible problems:
&gt;  &gt;  - Running Windows Update should take care of OS vulnerabilities and
&gt;  &gt;running an updated virus scanner should get rid of Trojans...
&gt;
&gt; Agreed.
&gt;
&gt;  &gt;After i had done that, i would start looking at my Billion or the
&gt;  &gt;possibility of installing another firewall..
&gt;
&gt; Why?  In a large-scale corporate environment, I can understand the need
&gt; to lock down everything except that which is strictly necessary, but for
&gt; your average home/small business user - what is a Linux firewall going
&gt; to achieve that the Billion doesn't?
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/rant&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
