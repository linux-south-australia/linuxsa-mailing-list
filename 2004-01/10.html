Gary,

&gt; &gt; nonetheless, for many of us, its just part of the
&gt; &gt; budget that won't
&gt; &gt; stretch. 
&gt; 
&gt; Why advertise that fact on this list. If you can't go,
&gt; you can't go, get over it :-| 

My friends have the conviction to tell the truth even if it is dark and
abject.

&gt; It's supply and demand, simple economics :-|
&gt; If prices were $10 you couldn't hold a conference like
&gt; this, there would be too much interest. If you play
&gt; your cards right the money invested could show a
&gt; profitable return. Networking. If you want it, go get
&gt; it!

Do not be so certain, young man, be not so certain of your words.

&gt; &gt; certainly, the organisers have all been happy to
&gt; help
&gt; &gt; computerbank/itshare sa whenever they could. they
&gt; &gt; are community aware.
&gt; &gt; but shaun, as coordinator of computerbank/itshare,
&gt; &gt; is certainly even
&gt; &gt; more aware of the disparity issue. its the raison
&gt; &gt; d'etre of what we do.
&gt; &gt; scarcely a sob story, no? a sob story would be
&gt; &gt; whinging WITHOUT doing
&gt; &gt; anything.
&gt; 
&gt; With all respect, this isn't about
&gt; computerbank/itshare. 

You have missed Shaun and Romana's point.

&gt; David,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've been broke and poor before
&gt; &gt; and I know what an extra
&gt; &gt; 50 cents can mean. It can mean the difference
&gt; &gt; between eating or not.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;sob&gt;&lt;sob&gt;&lt;snivel&gt;&lt;blubber&gt;

Is this the only response you can give me?

&gt; &gt; I know; I think I may have worked out a constructive
&gt; &gt; way to help Shaun get
&gt; &gt; to some parts of the conference.
&gt; 
&gt; That's positive, well done,

Yes, it is.

&gt; man sieht sich,

Yes, one does see so; it's a pity that the only positive thing you have said
is spoken in a language that is not generally understood on this list, isn't
it?

DSL

(1) Why am I bandying words with a wicked worm?
