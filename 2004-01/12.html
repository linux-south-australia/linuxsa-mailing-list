&gt; Hi Romana, 
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; because it MAY be something that can be incorporated
&gt; &gt; into future confs.
&gt; &gt; because awareness is a step towards change.
&gt; 
&gt; Change what? The dictates of money? The power of the
&gt; "haves"? Post 9/11, the only change is a widening of
&gt; the gap between rich and poor. 
&gt; Conferences are about networking. They support the
&gt; greater "good" (or "bad") of increased economic
&gt; growth, whether they are open source or not. 
&gt; 
&gt; The fact that you take the perspective of the "have
&gt; not" doesn't change anything. The quest to improve the
&gt; plight of the "have nots", runs the risk of becoming
&gt; altruistic patronisation. Just another form of power.
&gt; In the end everyone's in it for their own (self,
&gt; family or tribe) benefit.


yes, thats why we do volunteer work - why shaunand so many others,
inlcuding myself, work with itshare/computerbank.

i wont presume to ask what you do to enrich your community, you have so
eloquently demonstrated your ability to cheapen it.

no, im not in it for myself. i have a responsibility to teh society i am
in to participate in whatever way i can. some people regard that as
merely paying taxes. i regard that as the tip of an iceberg. societies
are as well off as the involvement in them.


how patronising is it of you to dictate how the 'have nots' sjhould
behave? would you prefer it to be swept away, conviniently quiet, so it
doesnt rattle you? or does the existence of thos eon low incomes offend
you, or merely serve tor einforce your smug sense of self superirority,
that you are conveying in your responses so far?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's supply and demand, simple economics :-|
&gt; &gt; &gt; If prices were $10 you couldn't hold a conference
&gt; &gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; this, there would be too much interest. If you
&gt; &gt; play
&gt; &gt; &gt; your cards right the money invested could show a
&gt; &gt; &gt; profitable return. Networking. If you want it, go
&gt; &gt; get
&gt; &gt; &gt; it!
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; no, but perhaps there is a way to change things.
&gt; &gt; perhaps there are ways
&gt; &gt; to offset costs further. each conf teaches the next
&gt; &gt; one more. 
&gt; &gt; sitting back not mentioning the difficulties means 
&gt; &gt; noone is the wiser, so nothing is learnt.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, right, -&gt; offset costs further: maybe microsoft
&gt; would like to sponsor the next conf :-)
&gt; I haven't heard you mention any specific ways to
&gt; 'offset costs', or have you mentioned any
&gt; difficulties. Be more specific, realistic. Publicising
&gt; your insolvency/helplessness doesn't qualify as such.

beginning a discussion does not mean i will not be involved in
discussions of solutions. actually, in the beginning of lca, i had
discussions with michael et al about this issue. i will continue to 
encourage discussion on the subject. i have had a number of talks with
david about possible solutions. he is interested in assisting, not
sitting back griping. i have failed to notice any practical solutions
from you. of course, self interest may preclude you from making an
effort, beyond derisive behaviour.

&gt; &gt; which of our recipients could afford even the
&gt; &gt; concession rate? answer : 
&gt; &gt; none. hence they missout on involvement. ok, the
&gt; &gt; vast majority of them 
&gt; &gt; wouldnt be interested.
&gt; 
&gt; These statements are presumptuous to say the least :-|
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to see constructive postings that describe in
&gt; more detail the difficulties you are referring to, not
&gt; to mention some more constuctive proposed solutions a
&gt; la DSL.


i have more experience behind me dealing with recipients - as i fail to
note your involvement, i have to wonder why you feel qualified to call
my assessment 'presumptious'.

hmm, your use of the word constructive, in light of your postings, is
risible - at best.

have a nice day, r:)
