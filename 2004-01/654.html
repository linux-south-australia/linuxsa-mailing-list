&gt;This is also an issue, many organisations don't want their IT 
&gt;destiny in their own hands.  What they want is a solution that's works; 
&gt;that requires minimal thinking.   Which is exactly what M$ provide.  

Minimal thinking is exactly why blanket outsourcing is irresponsible
for governments.

I think you may find that "outsource everything" mentality is changing
as governments (and large organisations) recognize that they are at the
mercy of
the vendors with that type of approach, and that they are not getting
value for money because they are making uninformed decisions based on 
the recommendations of a 3rd party and that 3rd party's interests.

Look at the mess that outsourcing created for SA government when value
for money was not part of the terms and conditions...


&gt;M$: Run our products, they work, they let you do you business, 
&gt;you don't think about IT.

Something that organisations, and especially governments, are starting
to realise is that their business _is_ IT, and that it is in their best
interest to have inside expertise when making large investments in
technology
solutions, the ramifications of which extend far beyond simple comparisons
about which product happens to do the job best at the time.


&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;So what is needed for *general* use is: commodity, self 
&gt;configuring Linux desktop.  NOT requiring expert assistance to install.

One word: Knoppix
Two words: Mandrake Move

How many "normal" users need to install Windows from scratch?
If desktop PCs came preinstalled with some of the latest distros then for
the majority of "average" users that issue would become a non-issue.
