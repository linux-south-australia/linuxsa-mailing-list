Hi,

<A HREF="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story</A>=20040127182807841

(The perens website seems to be slashdotted or something)

Quote:

"Thus, I urge all persons who have sympathy for Free Software, Open
Source, and Linux:

    * Do not cheer on attacks on the SCO site. By doing so, you falsely
implicate our community in the attacks, in the eyes of outsiders who
read your words. Our community believes in freedom of speech, not
silencing our opponent's speech through net attacks. We will defeat SCO
using the truth, not by gagging them.
    * Publicly deplore the attacks as an attempt to defame us, and not
an effort of our community. Show others this notice.
    * Continue to fight SCO, using all legal means at your disposal.
Show others the analysis of SCO's ongoing fraud at Groklaw.net and
elsewhere, and explain to them your own experience as a participant in
the Free Software community.
    * Continue the visible presence of Free Software as a force for good
in the world by producing excellent original software for everyone's
free use and deploying it wherever possible. Promote these projects to
the press and public as you carry them out. Do what you can for other
public-good projects such as schools and non-profit organizations.
FreeGeek.org is an excellent example of how to carry this out.
    * Show others by example that our side always takes the high road.
When they see a low-road sort of action like denial-of-service, spam, or
stock fraud, they'll know who to blame. 

Remember that your actions count. You are ambassadors of our community. "

Regards,

Michael
