&gt;Cheap Codegen 300W or greater from DIY IT supplies.

With the NEW video cards they need their own power feed anything other than 
a 400 watt PS is asking for trouble (come to the OCAU forums and find out 
how people get caught out like this).

&gt;I buy most of my
&gt;cheaper gear from them (they are a cheap warehouse on Manton street near
&gt;Hindmarsh stadium)., and they look after their regular customers very
&gt;well.
If you know what you want it doesnt matter where you get it from their 
stuff is fine I bought things from them often but I always shop around.

&gt;They dont know squat about Linux, but if enough people keep
&gt;bashing their ears about it, they will get there eventually. I keep
&gt;pushing them to sell their machines with Linux pre-installed just to get
&gt;an edge over the next guy.


&gt;I think about $45 for a 450W, which is a big chunky thing that is
&gt;relatively quiet but well cooled.
I have been told the 'cheaper' ones state a PEAK wattage not a sustained 
wattage this is where the video cards and lots of devices really test them. 
The AOPEN/ANTEC PS will sustain their rated wattage.

If you are seriously overclocking both the CPU and graphics card, or
&gt;just generally thrashing the whole thing in the heat, then consider
&gt;water cooling - its not that extreme a step to take, reduces noise, and
&gt;permanently fixes all your heat problems. If it still crashes then, you
&gt;know you have a power supply problem.  If a big power supply does not
&gt;fix the problem, then Id bet that you have cooked a RAM chip. Boot
&gt;(most) linux distros from CD, and do :
&gt;boot memtest


&gt;to check that your RAM is OK before blowing any money on power supplies
&gt;or cooling.  (Download the SoL-diag boot CD from www.sol-linux.com for a
&gt;memtest bootable CD)

OR JUST DOWNLOAD MEMTEST86 (ITS A SELF BOOTING MEMTEST FOR X86)
If it survives that it aint your ram. (it could be undervolted CPU 
undervolted card
