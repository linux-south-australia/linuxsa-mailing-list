Hi Gary

I believe you're new to this list?

Your rudeness is unbecoming of someone new to our community and doesn't
forward your cause well of becoming known.

Many subjects are discussed on this list ie Linux, Linux Community, Our
various work situations and Life in General.

Evening get togethers in one of the halls at the Uni would be good. A
LinuxSA meeting from the conference one night.

Not hard to think of Gary!

We try to be a supportive community.

Robyn

&gt; Hi Romana, 
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; because it MAY be something that can be incorporated
&gt; &gt; into future confs.
&gt; &gt; because awareness is a step towards change.
&gt; 
&gt; Change what? The dictates of money? The power of the
&gt; "haves"? Post 9/11, the only change is a widening of
&gt; the gap between rich and poor. 
&gt; Conferences are about networking. They support the
&gt; greater "good" (or "bad") of increased economic
&gt; growth, whether they are open source or not. 
&gt; 
&gt; The fact that you take the perspective of the "have
&gt; not" doesn't change anything. The quest to improve the
&gt; plight of the "have nots", runs the risk of becoming
&gt; altruistic patronisation. Just another form of power.
&gt; In the end everyone's in it for their own (self,
&gt; family or tribe) benefit.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's supply and demand, simple economics :-|
&gt; &gt; &gt; If prices were $10 you couldn't hold a conference
&gt; &gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; this, there would be too much interest. If you
&gt; &gt; play
&gt; &gt; &gt; your cards right the money invested could show a
&gt; &gt; &gt; profitable return. Networking. If you want it, go
&gt; &gt; get
&gt; &gt; &gt; it!
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; no, but perhaps there is a way to change things.
&gt; &gt; perhaps there are ways
&gt; &gt; to offset costs further. each conf teaches the next
&gt; &gt; one more. 
&gt; &gt; sitting back not mentioning the difficulties means 
&gt; &gt; noone is the wiser, so nothing is learnt.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, right, -&gt; offset costs further: maybe microsoft
&gt; would like to sponsor the next conf :-)
&gt; I haven't heard you mention any specific ways to
&gt; 'offset costs', or have you mentioned any
&gt; difficulties. Be more specific, realistic. Publicising
&gt; your insolvency/helplessness doesn't qualify as such.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; which of our recipients could afford even the
&gt; &gt; concession rate? answer : 
&gt; &gt; none. hence they missout on involvement. ok, the
&gt; &gt; vast majority of them 
&gt; &gt; wouldnt be interested.
&gt; 
&gt; These statements are presumptuous to say the least :-|
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to see constructive postings that describe in
&gt; more detail the difficulties you are referring to, not
&gt; to mention some more constuctive proposed solutions a
&gt; la DSL.
