&gt;&gt; I have a copy of DSL and as soon as we get a drive into another laptop
&gt;&gt; to build a hard-drive version then we will see just how well it runs 
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; a really low-spec machine. On the DSL web site there is a story of two
&gt;&gt; guys who got DSL running on a 486 with 16 Meg. I will be trying to do
&gt;&gt; similar but with 8 Meg.

&gt; Many years ago.. I tried something similar with slackware (2.0?).  The
&gt; machine was a 386SX with 4 Meg RAM and 40 Meg harddrive.  It was (is?)
&gt; possible but X was very, very, very slow.

Indeed.  Ian, I think you're going to have little luck running recent 
versions of the kernel, XFree86, window managers, etc on only 8MB ram - 
even if they are minimalistic versions (i.e. cut down 2.4.22, fluxbox, 
etc).  Over the years, things get more bloated with more features 
added, and they require far more resources.

If you're really serious about this, you could compile a 
linux-from-scratch on another system using source that's probably a few 
years old, and once you're done, copy the system over to the laptop HD. 
  The system won't exactly be secure, so I wouldn't want to put it on a 
network, but it'll run a hell of a lot nicer than if you try to get 
anything 'modern' on it (modern defined by /anything/ deemed 'current' 
today).

I'd consider looking at the BSD's too; they seem to be especially nice 
on older hardware, and kernel footprints seem to be less resource 
hungry.  Of course, building source on that 486 itself may prove 
interesting.  Handy trick to make life easy may be to nfs mount the 
laptop hard drive, chroot into it using a similarly configured but more 
powerful machine, and then do your stuff by normal means.
