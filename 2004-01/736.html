&gt; When you're plugged into the network, it's the same as being in a 
&gt; public place. People should be free to explore what is in public, and I 
&gt; certainly wouldn't be happy with trusting a bank that had not been 
&gt; thoroughly explored by a bevy of security experts AND amateurs.

So, the problem is: 

What _IS_ public space?  

It seems you want to define separately for "meatspace" (I hate that word)
and "virtualspace" the concept of Public Space.  

In that you want to define for virtualspace a much "larger" concept of
public space.  

eg. in meatspace, there is a concept of tresspass where
although you can enter spaces that you aren't meant to (eg. a person's
backyard) it's illegal to do so without permission.  

Whereas you wish to include the concept of a person's "virtual" backyard in
"virtualspace" in the definition of public space.

It _is_ a fine line between what's acceptable and what's not.  

It's acceptable to enter a person's yard to ring their person's doorbell to
announce that you are there.

It's unacceptable to ring the person's doorbell repeatably to annoy them or
to gain information about the likelyhood of them being absent in order to
rob their house.

Likewise in virtual space:

It's acceptable to ping a machine a few times to see if it's there.
It's acceptable to connect to a service (such as smtp) to conact a person
It's unacceptable to DoS them via "ringing their doorbell too many times".
It's unacceptable to skirt around looking for ways to attack/break in.

I fail to see why the meatspace and virtual space ideas of public space have 
to be so different.
