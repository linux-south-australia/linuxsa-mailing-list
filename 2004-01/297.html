&gt; &gt; What is your application type?
&gt; Very small Configuration and Management apps.  I have a few ideas for a 
&gt; product but have only vb experience (ie real world apps).  I've been 
&gt; working to learn PHP and have been migrating projects from ASP and 
&gt; ASP.NET to PHP but for what i need here it requires some actual GUI 
&gt; stuff.
OK, by now you probably have 101 different suggestions, so here is
another one :

- From what you have said above, Id go straight to PHP / GTK. Since you
already sort of know PHP from the above work that you have done, and are
happy hacking around with it for web stuff, keep in mind that :

1) You can easily write little text mode PHP scripts that get called to
do specific little jobs. These scripts have full access to mySQL, email,
ftp and other nice things that PHP is generally good at. You can call
these scripts from crontab to automate a lot of what you are doing, and
dont need a GUI for any of that. PHP also have the marvellous fgetcsv()
function which is great for munching through spreadsheet outputs, which
seem to be prevalent wherever you find Windows machines.

2) Use glade to knock-up a GUI layout.

3) PHP has bindings to GTK and libglade. Glade draws up forms with
widgets and defines callbacks. Glade then saves the whole thing to
human-readable XML.  Libglade provides a simple API to read the XML
file, draw up the window, and bind all the widget callbacks to functions
in your code. Bindings exist for all major languages, and it works on
Windoze as well. Most people assume PHP == web programming, but it
actually gets used a lot as a general purpose admin scripting tool, and
as a GUI language that has nothing to do with the web.

PHP is a lot like VB in that it is sucky from a computer science point
of view and somewhat inconsistent, but does have a lot of well-trodden
features and is damn popular. There are always better things around
(Python, Ruby, Java, Eiffel, etc, etc), but the fact is that if you are
using 1 language all the time, then you get pretty quick at writing code
in that 1 language.  Using 3-4 languages at once can mess with your
brain IMHO.


For Windoze, go to firepages.com.au, which has a complete PHP/glade/GTK
kit pre-built for windows.
