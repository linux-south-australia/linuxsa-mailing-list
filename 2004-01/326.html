&gt;&gt;&gt; A little off the topic but is PHP based on python?

&gt;&gt; Ha, god no.  They're entirely different beasts altogether 
&gt;&gt; conceptually,
&gt;&gt; and PHP's been around longer anyway I think, although it was 
&gt;&gt; originally
&gt;&gt; written in Perl.
&gt;
&gt; PHP (or its predecessor, PHP/FI?) has been around since 1995; Python
&gt; goes back to the late 80's (although 0.9.9 wasn't released until mid
&gt; '93, earlier versions were quite functional).

Didn't realize, I've read up a bit on python's history and indeed 
you're right.  I thought it was a recent language, but based off 
concepts that have been around for donkey's years.

Funny thing is that I've been mostly avoiding python as I had the 
impression it wasn't matured enough as a production-use language (as 
I've found with Ruby; it's a great language, and I love it, but there's 
still seemingly some rough edges, or maybe my coding just sucks :-).  
I've hacked at some python before though and really did like its 
structure.

I know what I'm going to be doing after LCA :-)
