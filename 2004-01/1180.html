&gt; You know... I think you're right.  But it might as well have been the

&gt; unqualified to do...

If there was one rule which you should follow to keep yourself safer
it would be never open an email attachment.  If you can't follow that
one rule then make never open an email attachment unless you know the
person who sent it to you, and you know that it really was sent by
that person, and you know that the person really meant to send it to
you.

It's trivially easy to forge the sender of email, so just because
the email claims to be from "mom and dad", don't assume that it is.
You can believe that it really was from "mom and dad" if they start,
"Dear Prickles," or some other endearment which they always use.
Even if you're sure the email wasn't forged, don't open the attachment
unless you were expecting them to send it to you, or unless they explain
what's in the attachment when they send it.  If "mom and dad" send you
an email asking how you enjoyed your holiday in Paris, and include an
attachment without any explanation, you should consider that perhaps
the attachment is a virus that attaches itself to all outgoing email.
To be safe you should flick them back a message asking what's in it,
and wait for their reply before opening it.

Follow these simple rules and there's a good chance you wont need a
firewall or virus checker.
