&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; Do you have anything unusual on your desktop?
&gt; &gt; (Maybe the contents of the zip are generic windows
&gt; &gt; XP desktop contents?)
&gt; Yes, I do/did. (Which was why I panicked.)
&gt; 
&gt; What I found interesting though was that when I had dissconnected my modem
&gt; from the swtich - I removed some of these icons and then saved the zip file
&gt; AGAIN to the desktop and unzipped it - it seemed to show all the CURRENT
&gt; contents of the desktop.
&gt; 
&gt; What's even MORE interesting is that I've looked for all the files that
&gt; MyDoom and other species of bugs I'm aware of leave as calling cards - and
&gt; can't find a single solitary one...  No Trojan's no Worms - nothing...
&gt; 
&gt; (Talk about perplexing!!!)  Consequntly (unless someone here has heard about
&gt; this particular zip file with no exe's or other executables on it that I
&gt; ran) then I'll have to conclude this was a wildly elaborate hoax that I fell
&gt; for.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Could this be the work of a virus on your machine?
&gt; &gt; Do you have a virus checker, is it up to date, is it
&gt; &gt; running? Have you run a scan since this happenned?
&gt; I DO. I run Trend Micro's latest version of PC-Cillin and I update it on a
&gt; DAILY basis.  It showed nothing - and still shows nothing...  I also ran the
&gt; online checker, and it too shows nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; Darned perplexing the whole thing is... Darned perplexing.
&gt; 

I gather that you are using windows, is it possible that the zip
contains a shortcut to c:\Desktop (or whatever the windows path is) or a
link to it that you are opening in a browser ?

browser

Personally, I think that is far more likely than anything else.
