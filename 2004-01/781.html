&gt; Not good enough, and not the way it's done either.

&gt; Sensitive information is segregated onto internal networks that have no 
&gt; physical connection to public networks. Separate computers are utilised 
&gt; for access to public networks.

That doesn't work when you have several Local Service Areas trying to
communicate between themselves and other states with information that
changes within a day. If you can think of a better way to let cops know that
guys who did a ram raid an hour ago are going to be at house X in 1/2 an
hour or we'll lose the stolen stuff for good, I'd like to hear it. It's not
as secure but when your time between Offence X being committed and the
offenders offloading stolen items is an hour or less, well what do you do?
Our comms are encrypted but when, say, you need to let all of your fellow
Analysts know about 10 ram raids in the space of 20 minutes, again what do
you do?

&gt; Tell me more about these sensitive files on public networks... are they 
&gt; really connected to public networks? How are they protected? Are there 
&gt; any plans to move them to private networks? Any intention of properly 
&gt; implementing at least SECMAN 3 to adequately protect this information?

I'm an Analyst, not a sysadmin (pretty clear I would have thought). You want
to tell me how the heck I should know???

I do know that I'm writing this email on a Win95 box on a network running
Windows. Can't be terribly secure.

Look it's just my opinion but I agree with the official line on this one; if
someone tried to hack into the Police network and got busted, benevolent
intentions or otherwise, the law should tell them that it's NOT okay.
