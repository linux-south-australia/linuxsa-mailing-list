Hi all.

I've scoured the 'net looking for more info on this problem but all to no
avail. Here goes;

I downloaded the latest NVIDIA binary driver (5328). I followed the
instructions to the letter to install it from the SUSE NVIDIA HOWTO. The
drivers installed and then I ran the 'sax2 -m -0=nvidia' command. It didn't
work (I'll dig up the error message tonight). So I tried running SaX2 to do
the job and my card (FX5200) isn't listed. There's once alled a GOFX5200 and
I thought (foolishly) "Close enough". SaX2 lets me do this, enables the 3D
option and when I go to test the configuration, it fails. No worries, I say,
I'll try something else. Everything freezes. I couldn't kill the X-server
with Ctrl-Alt-BackSpace and in fact couldn't do anything. So I do a hard
reset (I hate having to do that).

Next I (obviously foolishly again considering SUSE's weird file hacks)
edited XF86Config myself, changing the driver loaded from 'nv' to 'nvidia'.
I was in X at the time so I killed the server and tried to restart it. Black
screen. "No problem. I knew THAT wouldn't work. Heaven forbid Linux users
would want to edit our own config files" I say and reboot. To my utter
surprise, KDM starts, the NVIDIA splash screen appears and I'm able to
login. What the....? I reserved my excitement until trying a 3D app and sure
enough, 3D acceleration isn't enabled. So I tried running SaX2 in X and tick
the box 'Enable hardware acceleration' and, as the NVIDIA HOWTO said, it
told me that I needed to download the NVIDIA drivers, etc. 

The only thing is, the NVIDIA driver HOWTO told me that 3D acceleration
would be enabled even though SUSE thought it wasn't. It most certainly isn't
enabled so I'm at a loss as to why things aren't happening. Is it some
obscure SUSE-specific config file buried deep in the recesses of the tree
which needs a setting to be changed from "off" to "on"? Or is there
something else I'm missing?

Slack was NEVER this frustrating..............Having said that, virtually
everything else about SUSE 9.0 Pro is fan-bloody-tastic.

On another note, here's some humour:

What a crack-up! Can anyone else say 'public relations disaster'?
