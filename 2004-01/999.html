&gt; ..I don't think it Pigeon, but anyway.

No... but here's some imagination-fodder, since I don't have any photos...

My bicycle is a "standard" type, not a mountain bike. So it's somewhat
bigger, with bigger wheels (26"); a vertical line downwards from the back of
the saddle passes well forward of the rear wheel hub. This gives room for a
reasonable-sized carrier, which has a horizontal carrying surface, and
support tubes going down to the rear axle mounting points, which form an
isosceles triangle with the tubes from the rear axle up to the back of the
saddle tube.

The fridge is about two-thirds the size of the chap's old brown fridge; it'd
come up about to the top of the cooling fins on his fridge. I had it
crossways on the carrier, with the cooling fins facing to the rear. About
half its depth was supported by the carrier. A webbing tie-down strap and a
couple of trusty bungees held it in place.

Riding the bike with the fridge on was pretty easy, certainly a lot easier
(due to lower C of G) than when I have a 25kg sack of pigeon food on the
back. Wheeling it, by contrast, was not an option, as without my weight on
the saddle, the fridge went down and the front wheel came up...
