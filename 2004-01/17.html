Hi Shaun,

&gt; OK, so myself and the 100 odd people that we
&gt; introduce to linux every
&gt; year are just told to sod off because we dare
&gt; question the price.

Wrong conclusion.
Be realistic, it's a great price. 
There are ways to get admission to a conference if you
really want to. Put your energy into that, then you're
being constructive. 
Sheesh, I'm sure if you explained your situation to
the appropriate people, you would get the desired
outcome.

&gt; &gt; It's supply and demand, simple economics :-|
&gt; &gt; If prices were $10 you couldn't hold a conference
&gt; like
&gt; &gt; this, there would be too much interest. If you
&gt; play
&gt; &gt; your cards right the money invested could show a
&gt; &gt; profitable return. Networking. If you want it, go
&gt; get
&gt; &gt; it!
&gt; 
&gt; The implication being that the price is kept high to
&gt; keep out unsuitable
&gt; attendees- nice one.

Wrong again. And not constructive/positive.
You're taking the victim's perspective, so you'll be
treated like one. There are enough victims in the
world. Take the problem solver's perspective and help
mankind transcend.
 
&gt; Some people are not looking to profit out of every
&gt; experience. I wish to
&gt; learn, participate and help- you know like a
&gt; community ...

The reason why something doesn't work always has a
cause. Find the cause, solve it and... voila, you have
a solution. Community is nothing without the
individual.

&gt; &gt; With all respect, this isn't about
&gt; &gt; computerbank/itshare. 
&gt; 
&gt; You are right, but what of the linux users, is this
&gt; just for the paid
&gt; admins ?

Whatever...

Gazza,
