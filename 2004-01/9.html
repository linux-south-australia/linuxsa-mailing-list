Why advertise your impertinence, immaturity, ineptness for lateral thinking
and general lack of consideration for others on this list?

&gt; If you can't go, you can't go, get over it :-|

He was making his situation known so that consideration might be given (by
those with that ability) to people in his situation. As it turns out,
there's already been a response to that. As to what might happen for future
conferences...

&gt; It's supply and demand, simple economics :-|

What's so simple about it, perhaps you could provide some supportive
evidence for this claim?

&gt; If prices were $10 you couldn't hold a conference like
&gt; this, there would be too much interest.

Let's assume you're right (according to "simple economics"). What if prices
were $20, $50, $100? Care to apply your "simple economics" to each of those
situations? Maybe you have a "simple formula" that anyone organising future
conferences can use?

&gt; &lt;sob&gt;&lt;sob&gt;&lt;snivel&gt;&lt;blubber&gt;

What the?

I'm not clear as to exactly what point you were trying to make in your two
posts in this thread, Gary. Perhaps you could enlighten us so that we can
all benefit?

I have to say I found your responses somewhat offensive and I hope you have
the good grace to apologise to those that I believe you've been so rude to,
Shaun and David. But then, maybe I'm just not taking a sufficiently lateral
view of your comments?
