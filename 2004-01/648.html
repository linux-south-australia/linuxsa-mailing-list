No.

Albeit unintended, that comment isn't funny because Geoff was an
organiser and was well aware of the need to not only behave correctly
but to behave in a proveably correct manner. Michael Davies and the
other organisers made sure that this was maintained, as did IBM staff
(IBM staff were the judges and organisers of the Hackfest competition.)

So, some facts for the public record:

	- The competition and judging was not handled by organisers (the 
	  organge shirts) of whom I was one and Geoffrey was another.

	- Geoffrey did not have passwords or other administrative access
	  to matters relating to the hackfest.

	- Even in general organising Geoffrey kept away from things to
	  do with the hackfest.  He had many other areas of the conf
	  that kept him flat out so that wasn't a problem.

	- Michael Davies and I were the only ones outside IBM to even
	  know what the prize was until very near the end. You can
	  imagine how nice it would have been to share this with the
	  organisers (there's never been anything quite like it, as far
	  as I know.)

	- And last but not least, the code for all the bots will be
	  published shortly. You can peruse the code and see for
	  yourself that it was not copied from the others (which is what
	  the judges have already assured themselves of.)

&gt; That is one FINE prize. I mean, daaaaaayum that's a grunty little machine!

Yup!

I might also add that the organiser and one of the judges, Chris Yeoh,
got a big jump in his career by winning a hacking competition for a
games company overseas (Loki, now closed.) Seems like a good way of
stimulating talent...
