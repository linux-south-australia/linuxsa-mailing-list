&gt; I presume these "cheap" ones don't count as the sort of equipment
&gt; that a "qualified broadcast standard operator" would be using.

A safe presumption...  *Grins*

Without getting too bogged down in technical specifications, it'd be safe to
say you'd have to add another (minimum) $27k onto your $1k budget to acquire
a second hand camera that would do the job to 4:3 ratio (the standard tv
ratio we've had since the 70's) analogue broadcast specifications... (That
no-one uses any more of course because the whole worlds MINIMUM standard is
now 16:9 ratio (wide screen) digital... Which of course means that if you
want to do something that's going to stand up to the test of time, you'd
want it be 16:9 HDTV standard; which would add another $200k (minimum) on
top of that again...


&gt; I think Ryan was hoping to reach people who:
&gt; - would be coming (or would like to come) to LCA anyway
&gt; - wouldn't mind paying less than what they would otherwise pay to
&gt;   attend the conference
&gt; - happen to own a firewire camera
&gt; - wouldn't mind pointing that camera at a speaker for a few hours each
&gt;   day
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like a good deal to me.

That's probably because (with all due respect) you have no concept of how
much work goes into producing a product that anyone wants to watch. *Grins*

For example, even a domestic camera operator would need to set up before the
event including securing a power source, and then running power cord to it.

Then (for Occupational Health and Safety reasons) you'd need to securely
gaffe tape the power cable between the outlet and the camera as well as both
procuring and setting up a decnt FLUID Head tripod. (One that moves smoothly
instead of jerkily)

On top of that, you need to think about audio quality so that people can
HEAR what the speaker is saying so now you need to run an audio lead to the
speakers microphone as well as securely gaffe tape that down for the same
reasons...  So, obviously we're talking about a time investment of at least
two (plus) hours for someone to do all that in EACH Venue they're going to
be taping sessions in!!!

Now let's talk about PRODUCTION VALUES for a moment...  I'm assuming that
you'd like a product that's not set up showing the entire area the speaker
might use - which would mean a TINY figgure walking around off somewhere in
the distance on the TV Screen - but you'd like either a head to foot shot of
the speaker or (preferably) a mid shot of the waist up?

Well my friend, that requires that someone unlock their tripod and stand
behind the camera and WORK it from the moment everything starts to
everything finishes - and that means they're not concentrating on what the
speaker is saying; but on making sure that the framing/focus is correct and
that they're anticipating which way the speaker is going so they don't
dissapear from the frame...

NOW let's talk about LIGHTING.  Without some sort of training, surely we can
agree that the average person has no idea how/where to position lighting for
optimum effect, as well as agreeing that the average person has no concept
of what minimum requirement are needed for their camera...

In sumary: I DID understand that no-one is talking about getting
professionals to come in and do this...  But let's be honest here...  Do you
want to be able to hear the audio? Then it needs to be set up properly.  Do
you want to be able to see the speaker?  Then someone needs to be working
the camera that knows how to focus and frame.  Do you want people to sue you
for tripping over your cables and scraping their knee?  Then you have to
gaffe the cables down.  Do you want each speaker to be taped in all the
different areas of the Venue you're featuring?  Then you need to have
set-ups where each speaker will be.  Do you want to be able to SEE each
speaker?  Then you need to understand lighting requirements.

Geoffrey, I've only lightly touched on the very tip of the Iceberg to
illustrate to you that the reason it probably sounds like a good idea to you
because (like the majority of people) you don't understand how much work
goes into producing even a bad product - much less a good one that doesn't
look amateur...  :-)
