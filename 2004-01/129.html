&gt; What I'm looking for is a list (however short) of modems which really
&gt; are hardware modems, and are available in Adelaide.
&gt; Asking the computer shop for a hardware modem isn't enough: as I
&gt; indicated in my first email, I asked them to replace a soft modem
&gt; (Conexant HSF) with a hardware modem and instead all I got was another
&gt; soft modem (Conexant HCF). 

I don't know of such a list, the rule of thumb is to avoid any
modem which mentions things like "software modem" or requires M$.

&gt; Or alternatively, the name(s) of an Adelaide computer supplier who
&gt; knows what a real modem is.

according to some wholesale pricelists I have, there's
some available:

"Discovery 56K Hardware Int PCI  Rockwell chipset" RRP $35
"DLink DFM-560I 56K PCI Hardware Modem" RRP approx $50
"Dynalink PCI 56K F/D Hardware Modem" RRP approx $40

I personally have never seen these ones so can't say for sure
they're not soft modems but the descriptions sound promising.

(I'm assuming you have to have an internal modem for some
reason, because the simplist way is to ask for an external
modem, they are all real modems)

 &gt; Yeah, I could get a better supplier, but if I deal through the
 &gt; original shop, hopefully they'll refund me what I paid for the soft
 &gt; modem.

you could ask to swap the soft modem for something else you
want (blank CDs, mouse, cables etc) then get a decent modem
elsewhere.  Be aware a software modem can be obtained for
less than $15, which is why PC shops use them.

Dave.
