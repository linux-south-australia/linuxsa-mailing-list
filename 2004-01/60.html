The very best site for this is :

&gt; I want to look at a few more distribution sites than what I already have.
&gt; This is the PC  for now, to get it happening.
&gt; 
&gt; IBM Aptiva (Black)
&gt; 1 GIG HDD
&gt; Pentium MMX
&gt; 32 RAM ( getting more soon)
&gt; 
- Get more RAM, you should have at least 64MB for anything useful. Given
the size of your hard disk, you want have much room for a big swap area
either. Unfortunately, its getting pricey to source SDRAM and EDO these
days - even Ebay spot prices are higher than modern DDR 400 RAM - ouch !

Is that a PI or PII ?  Some distros need at least a PII  (i686) .. not
sure what is what here - its been so long. Is an i686 one of those
slotted PII's or is it anything with MMX support ?  Anyone ?

I dont know of any distros that are specifically optimized for Black
PC's though ... 

&gt; The only problem is I cannot seem to get the CD to boot up 1st from the
&gt; config. options. It simply will not allow me that option on the menu in
&gt; utilities section
&gt; 

That is trouble.

If you like, I can get you a small hard disk (like a 1.2GB or something)
with Linux pre-installed. Boot off that, and that circumvents needing to
boot the CD.  I could also organise another hard disk (500MB or
something) to use just for swap space, and I reckon you will be in
business.

For you choice of distro, depends on what you are hoping to run. Dont
expect to be able to install a full RedHat with Gnome/KDE & OpenOffice
on that system (not enough room or grunt), and bootable live-CD's seems
to be out of the question for you as well.

If you just want to setup a text based web/file server, then SoL is a
nice lightweight distro, very slick and optimised for your hardware. It
should also just fit. If not, you can easily make your own ISO based on
SoL by creating a new tarball without the bits you dont need. I really
like SoL :) and recommend it.  Otherwise, have a look at some of the
tiny distros like LRP, and DamnSmallLinux.

For a desktop distro, Lorma Linux is looking pretty good (Fedora based,
chopped down to 1CD, i686 optimized, includes multimedia apps like
MPlayer and MP3 support, and no server apps. But I dont think your
hardware would be able to fit even this on it.

If you are up for a real challenge, gentoo would fit on your hardware,
but you would have to go for a stage-1 install (again - no room for
stage 3), and compile everthing, which should take a while on that
little box.

----

If the lack of space and grunt is too much for you - I have a room full
of PC's that I just cant find the time to do up, so you are welcome to
have a dig.  (Better bring a small truck - I have a HP Dual CPU
Netserver / SCSI Raid server in there that weighs more than my car)
