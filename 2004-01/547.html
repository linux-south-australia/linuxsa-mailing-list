hehe - drone is an apt description I think. And BPA are the BORG

How?
Well probably it's because they are selling you a package from a range of
packages. They are what's on offer that's it.

Having said that a friend who came off OPTUS cable called up and said I want
cable but I have my own cable modem and he was able to get it he still
signed but it was exclusive of the cost of the modem. So perhaps ask for a
supervisor.


Why?
Support - minimise it as much as possible. Rather than go through the
plethora of possible DSL devices and avoiding we didnt seel you the modem
contact your supplier hassles.

Subject: Bigpong 's 'Must buy from us' ADSL modem policy


&gt; Can anyone out there in user land come up with a legal reason why
&gt; Telstra seem to be able to MAKE YOU buy one of their ADSL modems when
&gt; you sign up for a Bigpong ADSL account?
&gt; Go to the Bigpong ADSL signup pages and see if you can get past the
&gt; hardware selection page without selecting (and therefore buying) one of
&gt; their modems.
&gt; They only have 2 to choose from. One is a USB single port jobby and the
&gt; other is a 4 port ethernet modem/router with limited functionality.
&gt;
&gt; I rang them last month and said that I wanted to use my hardware and not
&gt; their (over priced) gear and the Bigpong drone just repeated that you
&gt; have to choose one of the two on offer, etc.
&gt;
&gt; This raises 2 questions-
&gt; How can they MAKE you buy one of their modems when the other guys will
&gt; let you use your own.
&gt; Why don't they actually tell you the makes and models of the crap they
&gt; are pedalling. (poetic license taken here- it may not actually be crap
&gt; but then we don't know, do we?)
&gt;
&gt; For this reason I have recommended private clients sign up to Internode
&gt; and iinet. At least they let you choose your hardware.
&gt; (this was not intended to restart a Dlink v Billion v
&gt; 'insert-favourite-brand' here type debate)
