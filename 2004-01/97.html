Hi all,
currently I am looking at installing a version of linux on to a x-box.
At present looks like the flavours are debian, suse 8 and mandrake.

Has any body installed yet???

If so what versions, and the bios flash you might of used.

I am looking at making the box 100% linux and the gaming side does not 
interest me at all, well there is only one game I would like to play and it 
is need for speed underground. But not really a problem.

The project I am looking at doing/setting up is to run a VDR, with about 6 - 8 
usb cameras recording movement with time stamping, web server, mail server, 
blar blar and so on.

Why you ask yourselfs because it can be done, second I have not done it , 
yet!, thrid is it a very cheap computer and the final bit it is a m$ product 
and deserves linux on it.

I have looked at other systems and the pricing is stupid to be polite, quick 
breakdown 
xbox $about 287
usb cameras about $30 each
done forget the usb hubs and cables


software FREE!!!


some quick maths a full vbr system could cost about $600, using a pc start at 
about $3500 for a four camera setup with no cameras.

pc breakdown
pc cheap box has to be quick 1000-2000
four channel card cost between 900-1500
software dont ask it costs


Is there anybody interested with this project.


Just asking.

Cheers Paul
