vector linux - dont know that i agree with their self assessment of
slackware, but...anyway, from vector linux site:
<A HREF="http://www.vectorlinux.com/">http://www.vectorlinux.com/</A>

VECTORLINUX is a small, fast, Intel Linux operating system based on one
of the original Linux distributions, Slackware. The enormously popular
Slackware is the true 'Unix' of Linux distributions and is used by major
corporations, universities and home users alike. It's popularity stems
from the fact that it is a robust, versatile and almost unbreakable
system. Slackware has been traditionally known to be about as user
friendly as a coiled rattlesnake and that's where Vector Linux comes
into play. We have produced a bloat free, easy to install, configure and
maintain Slackware based system that is second to none. The average user
can have a fully functional Slackware Linux system up in as little as 15
minutes with the security of knowing their operating system has been
built on a rock solid foundation. 

Vectorlinux provides a variety of features for the casual computer user
such as a lightning fast desktop with graphical programs designed to
handle your daily activities such as web surfing, sending and receiving
email, chatting on ICQ or IRC and running an ftp server. The power user
will be pleased that all the tools are there to compile their own
programs, use the system as a server and/or the gateway for their home
or office computer network. Administrators will be equally as pleased
due to the small size and memory requirements of the operating system
which can be deployed on older machines that may otherwise have been
long forgotten.

VECTORLINUX can handle any task large or small and is only limited by
the imagination of its users. The operating system occupies less than
450 megs of hard drive space when fully installed and has a full set of
preconfigured programs to handle all of your basic computing needs.

&gt; SO, on behalf of ITShareSA, I continue looking for small neat distros
&gt; for older hardware. I've already posted the freakishly named DSL, now
&gt; I'm looking at <A HREF="http://linuxdocs.tuxfamily.org/flonix/index.php">http://linuxdocs.tuxfamily.org/flonix/index.php</A>
&gt; Flonix
&gt; more info:
&gt; <A HREF="http://linuxdocs.tuxfamily.org/flonix/wakka.php?wiki">http://linuxdocs.tuxfamily.org/flonix/wakka.php?wiki</A>=EnPresentation
&gt; 
&gt; another deb based system. trying to look at slax, but slax.org is down.
&gt; this is a slackware distro. from comments on osnews, suggested hdd sizes
&gt; for some of these distros.
&gt; 
&gt; 200mb = DSL
&gt; 200mb to 500mb = Flonix
&gt; 500mb = Morphix light (or Slax if it can be installed OK)
&gt; 500mb to 1000mb = Vector 
&gt; 
&gt; will get back to you:)
