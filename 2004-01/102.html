On Sat, Jan 03, 2004 at 01:33:14PM +1100, Gary Idler imparted:
&gt; 1. A list is a dynamic entity -&gt; changing all the
&gt; time.
&gt; The tide never comes in the same way twice. Those of
&gt; you who feel threatened in the relative security of
&gt; the list are showing your resistance to that change,
&gt; or denying it completely. That's OK. 

no, juist suggesting YOUR imperatives arent necessarily the appropriate
ones. dynamics are good. change is good. arrogance in assuming you enter
something and you are THE ONE who knows the right way to change is
hubris. when we point that out, you call it 'resistance to change'.

no, just not accepting you are the authority on how the list should be.
the world according to gazza..it just isnt where this list is. sorry
dear, but you arent the great leap forward....

that doesnt make your opinion unviable. just your arrogant claims of
absolute rightness are kind of, well, silly:)

&gt; 2. Those of you who suggest moving on to another list
&gt; are misconceived. I am now part of this list,
&gt; therefore I could equally tell you to go jump. My
&gt; presence changes the nature of this list, accept it,
&gt; I'm not leaving. From now you'll have me to contend
&gt; with.

meh. we've had worse. dsl on a good day is more scary than you've
managed.;)

&gt; I don't believe in personalisation, so I won't attack
&gt; people personally (you can feel safe :-). By all means
&gt; attack me personally (I know who I am, I can handle
&gt; it). I acknowledge that there is something called
&gt; pecking order (a remnant from an ancient non-wired,
&gt; non-networked past, a form of bullying) but I don't
&gt; comply with its machinations, or subscribe to its
&gt; impositions.

oh, im a'quaking now. you rebel without a cause you. i can see that you
telling members of a list that their postings are drivel is 'shaking the
established order'. w00t. way to go. actually, i have a toddler who
behaves the same way - lots of noise and tantrums about they way SHE
wants the world to be;)

silly person. you fail to back it up with substance. derision is easy.
criticism is easy. i believe you made that point about shaun's orginal
post he should suggest some mechanism for fixing what he perceived.
(behind the scenes, that has occured. but then, oh all powerful
omnipotent one, you would have worked that out, no?)

but, you have done the positive suggestions HOW?:)
&lt;cough&gt;hypocrisy&lt;/cough&gt;

&gt; 3. I speak for an 'x' number of silent subscribers.
&gt; Some of you willfully forget that there are many out
&gt; there who equally detest the amount of crap that
&gt; sometimes goes on this list but don't have the nerve,
&gt; gusto, audacity or literary skills to say so.

oh, you voice of a silent majority!!!! 
(see also hubris, arrogance....)

and HOW do you know that this is the case?  
did the worshipful multitudes come to you - 
'we are not worthy oh great one - please, use your
considerable skills to change the world (via linuxsa) on our behalf?'

MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH &lt;-derisive laughter
SUUURRREEE they did:)

now, i have some lovely swamp land - you could build a great castle on
it (well, it will take three, but thats an aside...)
yours for a small sum....
and i have this nigerian businessman who has a great deal for YOU and
YOU alone.....

&gt; 4. I caution DSL about snippet5 above.
&gt; To use the term 'person of substance' is
&gt; discriminatory and puts your contribution in a
&gt; questionable light. 
&gt; (you imply that there are persons of lesser substance!
&gt; ouch). Mockery is a demonstration of fear (1. you
&gt; cannot discern/reconstruct/replicate the real argument
&gt; and therefore resort to sardonic/demeaning responses
&gt; -- 2. you feel threatened in your [brittle] position
&gt; of security -- 3. you're a mob creature who enjoys
&gt; throwing stones). Were you aware of that?

umm, pot to kettle - your glass house has stone shaped holes in it.....

&gt; It's all good :-)
&gt; time out,
&gt; Gazza

aint it just?;)
