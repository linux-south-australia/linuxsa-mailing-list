&gt;  &gt; Can anyone out there in user land come up with a legal reason why
&gt;  &gt; Telstra seem to be able to MAKE YOU buy one of their ADSL 
&gt; modems when
&gt;  &gt; you sign up for a Bigpong ADSL account?
&gt; 
&gt; Making the purchase of a product or service conditional on 
&gt; the purchase
&gt; of another, unrelated product or service is called "Third 
&gt; Line Forcing".
&gt; The ACCC doesn't have much of a sense of humour about it.  :-)

Even if it means that their CPE testing has only been done for certain
products and not all or is there some type of standard that businesses have
to follow that is deemed worthy of the ACCC?  For instance if a product is
made overseas (which I am sure most are?) how do you know it works with the
equipment that is being used in this country?  Personally I would have to
test it first then certify it for use within my existing equipment.  I do
not agreee with telstra in forcing you to buy their recommended equipment
but there is that possiblity that Telstra is using that excuse as a crutch.
