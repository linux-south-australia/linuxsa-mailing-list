&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Linux.conf.au 2004 is now only 1 week and 6 days away!
&gt; 
&gt; And you can now (correctly) refer to it as "this year's Linux
&gt; Conference" :-).  (as I've been doing all year anyway)
&gt; 
&gt; Did I say before that if you miss it you'll kick yourself?  We've got
&gt; a few surprises still waiting to be announced...
&gt; 
&gt; Happy New Year everyone,

Geoffrey, some of the conference looks very interesting, but I can't see
how I would get $275- $600 worth of benefit out of it. To me that money
is better spent giving people access to information technology, or on a
personal level feeding my children.

Congratulations on hosting this conference, I am sure it will be a huge
success, but it is just not a priority for the kind of money you are
asking.

I will stay on the community side of oss and leave the professional side
to those with the cash.

If you know of anyone who would like a computer or opensource skills and
can't afford them, let me know. I will do my best to give it to them.
