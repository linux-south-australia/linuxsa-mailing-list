My xlock interface in fvwm has given up the ghost. Curiosity has got me.
Digging deeper, running xlock in a shell at the command prompt delivers the
response - "can't get hostbyname". xlock -version or xlock -help runs fine.
It only fails when it is expected to do some locking etc. I'm confident
fvwm2rc.xlock is fine. My system host name is localhost.localdomain -
fairly rudimentary configuration established for dial up ppp connections.
xlock has worked in the past but I have not bothered with it much until
recently I wanted to show someone the hoopy screen savers and couldn't get
them to work with xlock. My work around was to run xscreensaver. This
problem is no great shakes but it has me intrigued. I have a suspicion if I
dig deeper I will find the root cause is in my configuration but I can't
pick it. Can you help?

Cheers
Nev' T
