Hello,

I have a system running linux redhat release 3 but with a brand new kernel.

i am being vague on purpose, as I'm not sure the version numbers are important.

I was stuffing around with the /etc/inittab file, and when I typed init q (to get init to
do its thing, it gave me ...

"Segmentation fault, giving up ..."

And Ever since then, I've been stuffed. The system on booting will load the kernel and do
all the hardware stuff, but I guess as soon as it tries to go to a runlevel it gives me
that excat same error message.

Interesting to note that when init dies the first time, the system continued as normal, in
fact, nothing happened. However, I couldn't ctrl-alt-del it, since init was the porgram
controlling that sort of thing.

Booting with a boot disk _give the same error_ even when trying single user mode, which I
did by typing "single" after the image name at the LILO prompt.
ie,
LILO
boot&gt; mount root=/dev/hda2 single

I know its not a hardware thing, cos when I boot and dont try to mount the filesystem, its
fine


Any ideas?

Regards
Jake
