&gt; I have just had a rush of blood to the head and bought a new HDD for my Linux
to quote the band 'Blur' Woohoo! ;)

&gt; 1) If I make the old HDD, a WD Caviar 1 Gb drive, the Master, and the new 
&gt; drive, a WD Caviar 4.3 Gb drive, the slave, and put Linux on the slave
&gt; drive only and Windoze on the master drive only, can lilo handle booting 
&gt; linux on the slave drive and dos on the master. Have you any suggestions re 
&gt; this cnfig to make sure it has the optimum configuration.
you can doit.......lilo will let you but from experience I'd say doit the
other way around i.e. make the linux drive the master and the lose95 drive
the slave. To do this just set table=/dev/hdb in the lose95 entry of
lilo.conf .  To doit your way set table=/dev/hda1 and at the top
boot=/dev/hdb , I'll get to root later :)

&gt; 2) Since I now have a clean 4.3Gb drive to play with, what partitions/sizes do
&gt; you recommend I break it up into. I use Linux for business type applications,
&gt; i.e. Applixware (free plug... you should all buy a copy from Geoffrey. 
&gt; Applix is damn good) plus all the usual other sundry things everyone seems 
&gt; to do with Linux.
&lt;HUMOR&gt; I can do plugs too :) I got a banana's in pyjama's mouse mad
today, you should all get one from your local abc shop 'coz the 'nanas
rule man ;)
&lt;/humor&gt;

In regaurds to the partitioning, put your swap in the middle of the drive
with / on one side and /usr on the other. Make / as small as possible (I
have 15M), make /var, /tmp, /home, /usr, /usr/src and /opt all individual
partitions. Having swap in the middle is optimal as the head spend most 
of it's time going ove that part of the drive and having / and /usr close
to it is also optimal as those are the partitions are where the heads
spend most of their time :) The size of your partitions is up to you, but
like I have said make / as small as possible 'coz if a unice gets bad
sectors in / then the show is over.....a bad sector in any other
partition and it will recover well but / is a special case. I recomend
/usr be at least 1GB.

Nikolai
