get the squid rpm or source and instlall it. Then just vi /etc/squid.conf
the file is pretty straight forward and contains good explanations and
examples of what to do. Failing that I am attaching a copy of my
squid.conf

have fun

# OPTIONS WHICH AFFECT THE NEIGHBOR SELECTION ALGORITHM
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_host 
#	To specify other caches in a hierarchy, use the format:

#	    hostname type http_port icp_port
#
#   For example,

#	cache_host littleguy1.usc.edu   sibling   3128  3130  [proxy-only]
#
#	      type:  either 'parent' or 'sibling'.
#
#	proxy_port:  The port number where the cache listens for proxy
#	             requests.
#
#	  icp_port:  Used for querying neighbor caches about
#	             objects.  To have a non-ICP neighbor
#	             specify '7' for the ICP port and make sure the
#	             neighbor machine has the UDP echo port
#	             enabled in its /etc/inetd.conf file.
#
#	    options: proxy-only
#		     weight=n
#		     ttl=n
#		     no-query
#		     default
#
#		     use 'proxy-only' to specify that objects fetched
#		     from this cache should not be saved locally.
#
#		     use 'weight=n' to specify a weighted parent.
#		     The weight must be an integer.  The default weight
#		     is 1, larger weights are favored more.
#
#                    use 'ttl=n' to specify a IP multicast TTL to use
#                    when sending an ICP request to this address.
#                    Only useful when sending to a multicast group.
#                    multicast groups are treated like regular parents and

#                    replies from them.
#
#		     use 'no-query' to NOT send ICP queries to this
#		     neighbor.
#
#		     use 'default' if this is a parent cache which can
#		     be used as a "last-resort." You should probably

#  TAG: cache_host_domain
#	Use to limit the domains for which a neighbor cache will be queried.
#	Usage:
#
#	cache_host_domain cache-host domain [domain ...]
#	cache_host_domain cache-host !domain
#
#	For example, specifying
#
#		cache_host_domain bigserver.usc.edu	.edu
#
#	has the effect such that UDP query packets are sent to
#	'bigserver' only when the requested object exists on a
#	server in the .edu domain.  Prefixing the domainname
#	with '!' means that the cache will be queried for objects
#	NOT in that domain.
#
#	NOTE:	* Any number of domains may be given for a cache-host,
#		  either on the same or separate lines.
#		* When multiple domains are given for a particular
#		  cache-host, the first matched domain is applied.
#		* Cache hosts with no domain restrictions are queried
#		  for all requests.
#		* There are no defaults.

#  TAG: neighbor_type_domain
#
#	usage: neighbor_type_domain parent|sibling domain domain ...
#
#	Modifying the neighbor type for specific domains is now
#	possible.  You can treat some domains differently than the the
#	default neighbor type specified on the 'cache_host' line.
#	Normally it should only be necessary to list domains which
#	should be treated differently because the default neighbor type
#	applies for hostnames which do not match domains listed here.
#
#EXAMPLE:
#	cache_host  parent cache.foo.org 3128 3130
#	neighbor_type_domain cache.foo.org sibling .com .net
#	neighbor_type_domain cache.foo.org sibling .au .de

#  TAG:	inside_firewall
#	This tag specifies a list of domains inside your Internet
#	firewall.
#
#	Usage: inside_firewall my.domain  [ my.other.domain ...]
#
#	The use of this tag affects the server selection algorithm in
#	two ways.  Objects which do not match any of the listed domains
#	will be considered "beyond the firewall."  For these:"
#		- There will be no DNS lookups for the URL-host.
#		- The object will always be fetched from one of
#		  the parent or neighbor caches.
#
#	As a special case you may specify the domain as 'none' to force
#	all requests to be fetched from neghbors and parents.

#  TAG:	local_domain
#	This tag specifies a list of domains local to your organization.
#
#	Usage: local_domain my.domain [ my.other.domain ...]
#
#	For URLs which are in one of the local domains, the object
#	is always fetched directly from the source and never from a
#	neighbor or parent.
#
#local_domain bigbucks.com

local_domain localnet ukraine.humbug.org.au 

#  TAG: local_ip
#	This tag specifies a list of network addresses local to your
#	organization.
#
#	Usage: local_ip ip-address
#
#	This tag is similar to local_domain, except that the IP-address
#	of the URL-host is checked.  This requires that a DNS lookup
#	be done on the URL-host.  For this reason, local_domain is
#	preferred over local_ip.  By using local_domain it may be
#	possible to avoid the DNS lookup altogether and deliver the
#	object with less delay.
#
#local_ip 10.0.0.0
#local_ip 172.16.0.0

#  TAG: firewall_ip
#
#	Just like 'inside_firewall' but for IP addresses.  NOTE:
#	firewall_ip and local_ip are mutually exclusive.  If you
#	use firewall_ip then local_ip will be ignored.
#
#firewall_ip 10.0.0.0
#firewall_ip 172.16.0.0

#  TAG:	single_parent_bypass
#	This tag specifies that it is okay to bypass the hierarchy
#	"Pinging" when there is only a single parent for a given URL.
#
#	Usage: single_parent_bypass on|off
#
#	Before actually sending ICP "ping" packets to parents and 
#	neighbors, we figure out which hosts would be pinged based
#	on the cache_host_domain rules, etc.  Often it may be the
#	case that only a single parent cache would be pinged.
#
#	Since there is only a single parent, there is a very good
#	chance that we will end up fetching the object from that
#	parent.  For this reason, it may be beneficial to avoid
#	the ping and just fetch the object anyway.
#
#	However, if we avoid the ping, we will be assuming that the
#	parent host is reachable and that the cache process is running.
#	By using the ping, we can be reasonably sure that the parent
#	host will be able to handle our request.  If the ping fails then
#	it may be possible to fetch the object directly from the source.
#
#	To favor the resiliency provided by the ping algorithm,
#	single_parent_bypass is 'off' by default.
#
#single_parent_bypass off

#  TAG: source_ping
#	If source_ping is enabled, then squid will include the source
#	provider site in its selection algorithm.  This is accomplished
#	by sending ICP "HIT" packets to the UDP echo port of the source
#	host.  Note that using source_ping may send a fair amount of UDP
#	traffic out on the Internet and may irritate paranoid network
#	administrators.
#
#	Note that source_ping is incompatible with inside_firewall.
#	For hosts beyond the firewall, source_ping packets will never
#	be sent.
#
#	By default, source_ping is off.
#
#source_ping off

#  TAG: neighbor_timeout (seconds)
#	This controls how long to wait for replies from neighbor caches.
#	If none of the parent or neighbor caches reply before this many
#	seconds (due to dropped packets or slow links), then the object
#	request will be satisfied from the default source.  The default
#	timeout is two seconds.
#
#neighbor_timeout 2

#  TAG: hierarchy_stoplist
#	A list of words which, if found in a URL, cause the object to
#	be handled directly by this cache.  In other words, use this
#	to not query neighbor caches for certain objects.  You may
#	list this option multiple times.
#
#	The default is to directly fetch URLs containing 'cgi-bin' or '?'.
#
hierarchy_stoplist cgi-bin ?

#  TAG: cache_stoplist
#	A list of words which, if found in a URL, cause the object to
#	immediately removed from the cache.  In other words, use this
#	to force certain objects to never be cached.  You may list this
#	option multiple times.
#
#	The default is to not cache URLs containing 'cgi-bin' or '?'.
#
cache_stoplist cgi-bin ?

#  TAG: cache_stoplist_pattern		# case sensitive
#  TAG: cache_stoplist_pattern/i	# case insensitive
#
#	Just like 'cache_stoplist' but you can use regular expressions
#	instead of simple string matching.  There is no default.

# OPTIONS WHICH AFFECT THE CACHE SIZE
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
#  TAG: cache_mem (in megabytes)       
#	Maximum amout of VM used to store objects in memory.
#	This includes:
#		in-transit objects,
#		negative-cached objects,
#		"hot" objects
#	The value of cache_mem is an upper limit on the size of the
#	"in-memory object data" pool.  This is a pool of 4k pages used
#	to hold object data.
#
#	In-transit objects have priority over the others.  When
#	additional space is needed for incoming data, negative-cached
#	and hot objects will be released.  In other words, the
#	negative-cached and hot objects will fill up any unused space
#	not needed for in-transit objects.
#
#	The values of cache_mem_low and cache_mem_high (below) can be
#	used to tune the use of the memory pool.  When the high mark is
#	reached, in-transit and hot objects will be released to clear
#	space.  When an object transfer is completed, it will remain in
#	memory only if the current memory usage is below the low water

#cache_mem 4 

#  TAG: cache_swap (in megabytes)
#	Maximum about of disk space used by the cache.  The default is
#	100 megabytes.  When the disk usage gets to this size, the cache
#	uses LRU replacement to evict objects as new objects are cached.
#	Note that cache_swap is set to:

#  TAG: request_size
#	Maximum allowed request size in kilobytes.  If people are using

#	percent is an integer number.
#
#	Please see the file doc/Release-Notes-1.1.txt for a full
#	description of Squid's refresh algorithm.  Basically a
#	cached object is:
#
#		FRESH if age &lt; min
#		STALE if expires &lt; now
#		STALE if age &gt; max
#		FRESH if lm-factor &lt; percent
#
#	The refresh_pattern lines are checked in the order listed here.
#	The first entry which matches is used.  If none of the entries
#	match, then the default will be used.

#Default:
#refresh_pattern 	.	0 20% 4320
#refresh_pattern	.	30 80% 10080

#  TAG: reference_age
#	If set, objects which have not been referenced for this amount
#	of time will be purged from the cache.  This is the only
#	parameter for removing cache objects except when the disk space
#	reaches the high water mark.  By default reference_age is 
#	disabled.
#reference_age 0

#  TAG: quick_abort
#	By default the cache continues to retrieve objects from
#	aborted requests.  This may be undesirable on slow (e.g. SLIP)
#	links and/or very busy caches.  Impatient users may tie up
#	file descriptors by repeatedly aborting and re-requesting
#	non-cachable objects.
#	
#	Usage: quick_abort    min-kbytes percent max-kbytes
#
#       When the user aborts a request, Squid will check the
#	quick_abort values to the amount of data transfered until
#	then.
#
#	If the transfer has less than 'min-kbytes' remaining, it
#	will finish the retrieval.  Setting minlength to -1 will
#	disable the quick_abort feature.
#
#	If the transfer has more than 'max-kbytes' remaining, it
#	will abort the retrieval.
#
#	If more than 'percent' of the transfer has completed, it will
#	finish the retrieval.
#
#quick_abort    -1 0 0

#  TAG: negative_ttl (in minutes)         
#	Time-to-Live (TTL) for failed requests.  Certain types of
#	failures (such as "connection refused" and "404 Not Found") are
#	negatively-cached for a small amount of time.  The default is 5

# TIMEOUTS
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: connect_timeout (in seconds)
#	Some systems (notably Linux) can not be relied upon to properly
#	time out connect(2) requests.  Therefore the squid process
#	enforces its own timeout on server connections.  This parameter
#	specifies how long to wait for the connect to complete.  The
#	default is two minutes (120 seconds).
#
#connect_timeout 120

#  TAG: read_timeout (in minutes)         
#	An active connection will be aborted after read_timeout minutes
#	of no activity on that connection (i.e., assume the remote server
#	or network connection died after the connection was established).
#	The default is 15 minutes.
#
#read_timeout 15

#  TAG: client_lifetime (in minutes)         
#	The maximum amount of time that a client (browser) is allowed to
#	remain connected to the cache process.  This protects the Cache
#	from having alot of sockets (and hence file descriptors) tied up
#	in a CLOSE_WAIT state from remote clients that go away without
#	properly shutting down (either because of a network failure or
#	because of a poor client implementation).  The default is three
#	hours, 20 minutes.
#
#	NOTE:  The default value is designed with low-speed client
#	connections in mind.  200 minutes should be plenty of time to
#	transfer a 10M file at 1k/sec.  If you have high-speed client
#	connectivity, or occasionally run out of file descriptors,
#	we suggest you lower this value appropriately.
#
#client_lifetime 200

#  TAG: shutdown_lifetime (in seconds)
#
#	When SIGTERM or SIGHUP is received, the cache is put into
#	"shutdown pending" mode until all active sockets are closed.
#	This value is the lifetime to set for all open descriptors
#	during shutdown mode.  Any active clients after this many
#	seconds will receive a 'lifetime expire' message
#
shutdown_lifetime 5

#  TAG: clean_rate (in minutes)
#	How often to force a full garbage collection.   Garbage collection
#	involves checking the expire time of every object in the cache.
#
#	NOTE: this option is provided only for backwards compatibility.
#	We recommend that you leave it disabled (i.e. set to -1).  Expired
#	objects are removed from the cache little by little as a part of

# OPTIONS FOR THE CACHE REGISTRATION SERVICE
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#	This section contains parameters for the (optional) cache

#
#	An 'announcement' message is sent (via UDP) to the registration

#httpd_accel_with_proxy on

#  TAG: httpd_accel_uses_host_header
#	HTTP/1.1 requests include a Host: header which is basically the
#	hostname from the URL.  Squid can be an accelerator for
#	different HTTP servers by looking at this header.  However,
#	Squid does NOT check the value of the Host header, so it opens
