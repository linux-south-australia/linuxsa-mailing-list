My experience is that using ftp for program-to-program file transfers is
not the best use of the tools available.  Unix provides a much better
solution.  I see several disadvantages with <A HREF="ftp:">ftp:</A>

 1. Owing to clock drift, the receiving machine cannot know exactly when 
    the incoming file will arrive, so it must poll at various times to
    see if the file has arrived.  This is a waste of resources.

 2. There is a delay (on average it's half the poll interval) between
    the data being sent and it being available on the remote system.
    This can be most disconcerting for people checking the remote system,
    when they find that data, which they know has been entered, is not
    available on the remote system.

 3. The transfer might fail for some reason, such as a network problem,
    and so you are obliged to determine some mechanism to retransmit the
    file at a later date.

 4. The possibility exists that the receiving machine might poll while
    the file is in transit, and therefore it might process a partial file.
    You are therefore obliged to determine some mechanism to work around
    this possibility.

 5. If the receiving machine fails to poll between two successive transfers,
    and if you use a static filename (e.g. if you always send the /tmp/data)
    you will lose data.

All of these issues are solvable, but you should not need to solve them.
There is, in my opinion and my wide experience, a ready made solution that
suffers none of these problems.  This solution is to use email.  Remember
that you can send mail to a program (e.g. .forward to "| myprogram", or
similar use of /etc/aliases).  Use of email means:

 1. You don't have to poll.

 2. The data is processed immediately upon being received.

 3. Transient delivery faults are handled automatically by the mail system.

 4. Assuming you trust your mail system, each file sent will be received,
    so you won't ever lose data or try to process a file which is still
    in-transit.

On top of this, well constructed Unix programs are often filters, so that
the system logically looks like this:

   generate-data | transmit-data | receive-data | consume-data

Since the email message is provided to the receiving program as standard
input, it fits very nicely into this (standard) model.  Note that the
actual sequence would be:

  generate-data | mail <A HREF="mailto:program@remote.hosts">program@remote.hosts</A>

and in program's .forward

  "| consume-data"


I strongly urge everyone to take advantage of this tool, which seem so
much more appropriate to me than does ftp.

As a final comment, I pass on to you what some wit (name now forgotten)
once said:  "Every program at MIT will evolve until it can read mail."
There is more than a grain of truth in this thought.
