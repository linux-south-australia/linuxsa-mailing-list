Some other functions of note:

vga_setpalvec(int start,int stop,char *pal)
vga_getpalvec(int start,int stop,char *pal)

vga_waitretrace()

Calling a function to wait for the vertical retrace probably isn't a good
idea so you might want to inline it:
#define WAIT_RETRACE            \
        __asm__ __volatile__ (" \
        1: in (%%dx),%%al;      \
           test $8,%%al;        \
           jne 1b;              \
        1: in (%%dx),%%al;      \
           test $8,%%al;        \
           je 1b"               \
        ::"d" (0x3da): "al")

It is ok to use ports here since there is no state for the library to
remember.

There are a lot of svgalib demos that come with the svgalib source. There
is also a lot of documentation in there. There are lots of man pages with
svgalib. I would imagine most distros would put them in with the rest of
the pages so they can be accessed normally. Red Hat (5.1 at least) puts
them under /usr/doc/svgalib*/man?. They have a script called "tman" which
you can use to view them, or you can add "MANPATH /usr/doc/svgalib-1.2.13"
to your /etc/man.config". If you have a different version of svgalib you
will need to change the path.

If you want to use any of the vgagl functions you need to include
"vgagl.h" and link with "-lvgagl" as well. 

If you want to do things in a higher video mode things get more complex.
320x200 256 is nice because of the way the memory is mapped on the video
card. In higher modes it takes a lot more to put a pixel on the screen.

You can use functions like vga_drawpixel() and gl_setpixel() but they are
slower due to added overhead.

If you are drawing to a buffer first you can
"memcpy(graph_mem,buffer,64000)" to draw to the screen. Similarly you can
"memset(graph_mem,0,64000)" to clear the screen. 

There are about 200 man pages for Svgalib, so there is a lot more to it
than the little I have shown here :).

Also, you will need to use root to run the programs (or setuid them) since
Svgalib needs root to get access to the video card. If the binary is
setuid it will drop the privileges as soon as it is set up.

If you don't want to use the VGA card directly you could try libGGI. There
are some RPMS on ftp.ggi-project.org. libGGI will allow your program to
be displayed on many different targets. This is a pretty simple way to get
a framebuffer in X. While the KGI isn't recommended at the moment (its
rather alpha :)), libGGI appears quite stable (for me at least).

Mark
