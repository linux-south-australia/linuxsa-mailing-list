Steve,
	Don't mean to pop your bubble, but about three years ago,
a company called "Food Now" (www.foodnow.com, now defunct) set up an
"online pizza ordering" site.  Orders could be requested from a web page,
and, based on the address[1], the order was faxed to the relevant
pizza shop (Pizza Haven were the biggest supporters of this).  It also
housed an index of Melbourne restaurants with some reviews, etc (ala
"melbourne.citysearch.com").

1: We were using Melways grid reference, since Melways is the canonical
map for Melbourne.  They had a text file, I don't know if they had to
convert it to that, or that's the way they got it.

The original software contractors were basically totally incompetent,
and somewhat dishonest, so the owners (foodnow/virtual something or
other) contacted me (via aus.ads.jobs, incidentally) and I managed to
get it working with a "little help from my friends" (especially Larry
Wall, ie. perl :-)

The owners and I were pretty pleased with the result (considering the
development window we had) but unfortunately the principle partner
decided, having spent significant sums on development, he didn't want
to pay peanuts on keep it alive long enough to catch on.  The fact that
he could be Mr Citysearch now will probably eat at him forever :-)

I'd be happy to help twiddle with the whole deal again,
Nate
