In case anyone hasn't heard yet, here is a bit of info sent to me by Oracle in
response to a question I put to a local Oracle sales guy to try to find out the
official position on the up-coming release of Oracle 8 for Linux.

I know this is a couple of days old now, but just in case anyone missed it, here
is the news, from the horse's mouth.

************************************************************************

ORACLE ANNOUNCES  ORACLE8  AND ORACLE APPLICATIONS SUPPORT FOR LINUX ON
INTEL 
SERVERS 
 
Responds to Developer Demand for an Open, Low Cost Platform for Building and 
Deploying Database Applications on the Internet 
 
REDWOOD SHORES, Calif., July 21, 1998 -- Oracle Corp. today announced that
it 
will be porting Oracle8,  the industry's leading database, and Oracle 
Applications to the Linux operating environment.  Linux is an open UNIX 
operating system that is available for download from the Internet at no
charge 
and is a strong leader in the Internet service provider (ISP) market.  It is 
also the fastest growing UNIX platform in the enterprise with an estimated 7 
million users, according to the Linux Online.  Oracle8 on the Linux platform 
will be made available for a 90 day free trial via the Web by the end of
1998. 
The products will initially be available on Intel server platforms. 
 
The availability of Oracle8 and Oracle Applications on Linux will enable 
current Linux users to deploy enterprise-class applications with
unparalleled 
performance at the lowest possible cost.  In addition, users will be able to 
reap the scalability and flexibility benefits of Oracle8 and Oracle 
Applications in Linux's open environment. 
 
"Over the last few months, as the ground swell for Linux has increased, our 
customers have asked for Oracle?s commitment to this popular platform.  This 
announcement is a direct response to that customer demand," said Gary Bloom, 
executive vice president of system products at Oracle Corp.  "Oracle on
Linux 
will provide a compelling alternative for companies that want an 
Internet-based, low-cost point of entry for Web-enabling their business."

"Oracle's support of Linux validates the strength of the operating system
and 
will serve as a catalyst for the wide-scale adoption of Linux in the 
enterprise market," said Robert Young, CEO, Red Hat Software, Inc.  Red Hat 
Software, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., builds and maintains the 
award-winning Red Hat Linux operating system. 
 
"We're thrilled with Oracle's decision to support the millions of Linux
users 
worldwide," said Larry Augustin, president and co-founder of VA Research
Linux 
Systems and a member of the Linux International Board of Directors.
"Combining 
Oracle's world-class technology with a world-class operating system like
Linux 
will create an unbeatable mission-critical enterprise platform. Oracle on 
Intel users now have access to a rock-solid scalable operating system."  
VA Research (www.varesearch.com) is the leading Linux systems specialist, 
developing Linux workstations and servers for the enterprise, Internet and 
engineering markets. The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in 
Mountain View, California. 
 
Shipment of Oracle8 for Linux on the Intel platform is expected by the end
of 
1998. Shipment of Oracle Applications for Linux on the Intel platform is 
expected  in the first quarter of 1999.
