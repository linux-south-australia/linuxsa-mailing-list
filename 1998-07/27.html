&gt; I've just installed KDE on my machine.  I can get it
&gt; to start up ok if I am running in run level 3, by doing
&gt; a startx.  I've edited my .xinitrc file and added appropriate
&gt; env variables in .cshrc.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm now trying to get it to start automatically in run level 5.
&gt; Unfortunately, fvwm95 keeps starting.  I've edited 
&gt; /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc & /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients/
&gt; I've even added a line to /etc/X11/xdm/Xsession.  I've
&gt; added the env variables to /etc/csh.cshrc as well.
&gt; Unfortunately, I can't get it to go!!  Have I missed something
&gt; out?

.xinitrc is only used by startx.  The one you were looking for is
.xsession, which is used when you log in through xdm.  BUT the default
/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc and /etc/X11/xdm/Xsession files (at least under
RHL) are set up so that you can put a file .Xclients in your home
directory (don't forget to chmod +x .Xclients) and it will be used by
both startx and xdm.

In summary: if you want different behaviour for startx and xdm, use
.xinitrc and .xsession.  If you want the same behaviour use .Xclients.

&gt; Also, (the "and ...." part), I have followed the directions
&gt; regarding the date problem with RH 5.0 talked about recently,
&gt; but I'm still having date problems.  Which file is it,
&gt; that tells the system that my clock is set to GMT as opposed
&gt; to CST.  My clock is adding 9.5 hours to the sys clock.

/etc/localtime is a symlink which selects what timezone you are in:

cd /etc
rm localtime
ln -s ../usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/South localtime
(or Australia/Adelaide -- they are the same)

/etc/sysconfig/clock is a file which determines whether your hardware
clock is in UTC or local time.  There should be a line in there with
either "UTC=true" or "UTC=false".

Other related stuff:

To set your Unix clock, use date.  To set your hardware clock, use the
hwclock utility.  Something like 'hwclock --hctosys --utc' should set
the hardware clock to your Unix time.
