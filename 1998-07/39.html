&gt; Hello, it would seem that i am presently biting the bullet so to speak.
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen KDE as a screen shot in a magazine and like what i see. It
&gt; appears more of a "pretty" X window manager.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that it comes with one of the RedHat distributions, i would like
&gt; someone to confirm this for me. Geoffrey will do seeing as he sells it.

Here I am, here I am! :-)

Red Hat Linux does not include KDE.  It includes Gnome, which is
another desktop environment.

The summary (IMO, and not speaking for anyone):

- KDE is free software.
- KDE depends on a library called Qt.
- Qt is not free software (among other restrictions, you need to pay
  money if you want to develop a commercial application using it).
- Red Hat don't want such a major part of their distribution (that is,
  the desktop) to be dependent on non-free software.
- Red Hat want any part of their distribution to be able to be used to
  develop any sort of software, free or non-free.
- Another issue is that some people believe that distribution
  manufacturers are violating the Qt license if they ship it.
- Therefore unless the license agreement on Qt changes, Red Hat will
  not be shipping KDE and will continue sponsoring Gnome.

KDE is ahead of Gnome because it has been around for longer, but there
is certainly a lot of effort going into Gnome.  Red Hat have created a
division called Red Hat Advanced Development Laboratories (RHAD Labs).
From their web page at <A HREF="http://www.labs.redhat.com/:">http://www.labs.redhat.com/:</A>

RHAD Labs - A seething pit of free software development ... 

Welcome to Red Hat Advanced Development Labs, a brand spanking new
division of Red Hat Software.  The short story is that we're working
on problems of usability of Linux. In particular, our current project
is working on a graphical desktop for Linux. If you are interested
check out the long story. 

Right now we are working with the GNOME Project to develop a free
graphical desktop environment. For details about exactly what we are
doing see our projects page.

&gt; It appears to me now that RedHat is the most dominant force in Linux
&gt; distributions in Australia and Adelaide and thus probably the one that ppl
&gt; can help the most with when i run into trouble.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to use it for e-mail, news, and Web Browsing as well as a good
&gt; deal of study. I would like to use the latest versions of wine (they are
&gt; actually getting pretty good atm). Probably a little program development
&gt; (yeah simple things atm but who knows...). I would like to use X running KDE
&gt; for a majority of this (as it uses my new monitor better than the command
&gt; line does).
&gt; 
&gt; Will i run into problems with the Glibc5 and the Glibc6 problem? How do i
&gt; allow for apps to use their lib and no the other lib to lessen problems,
&gt; WINE i know has problems with this.

You shouldn't run into any problems; Red Hat 5.1 is set up so that you
can run a.out, libc5, and glibc applications.  The most noteworthy
exception to this is StarOffice, but there is a staroffice-wrapper RPM
that installs the libc5 version that StarOffice wants, and it puts it
somewhere where it can't interfere with anything else.

I don't know what the Wine problem is -- I compiled Wine-980614 a few
days ago on a RH5.1 system with no problems.

&gt; Also seeing as i'll prolly wish to
&gt; distribute my apps what about the users that don't use a Glibc6 system?

Anything you compile will be linked against glibc.  It is possible to
compile things for libc5, but it does involve some work.

&gt; I have a P133 overclocked to 150, 16MB ram, 2MB vid and a CDROM, a 33.6
&gt; modem. There will be in three or four days an LS-120 disk drive (super disk)
&gt; and a HDD of 1.2 Gig.
&gt; 
&gt; Presently i am using 100% of my partition for win as a FAT32 partition, i am
&gt; interestred in filling the last IDE interface that i will have left after my
&gt; LS-120 with another HDD all to linux's self. What size should this be with
&gt; regard to my wants and what else should i do to my computer?

I'd just replace the FAT32 partition with an ext2 partition.  That'll
save you the cost of a new hard disk :-).

&gt; btw: what is Suse?

That's another Linux distribution.  IIRC, it's developed in Germany
and is rather popular over there.
