&gt;instant local search engine
&gt;	with a unique cross reference between phone book data and map

I'd be interested to find out how well you go with getting through the
book.dat file, and I'd also be interested in the legalities involved in its
purchase. The main question I have is does the $19.95 CD allow you to
recursively reverse search the database so you can enter an address, or
phone number and get the name of the house/business. (I doubt it) I seem to
remember that Telstra used sell (they may still) a CD that allowed you to
do this for around $600. 

Imagine the poularity of a web interface that allows a *recursive*,
*reversable* search of the database. Pretty useful now that people have
caller ID on their phone numbers and if it was as popular as other 'cool',
'free' services like the mobile phone messaging pages, could pull in quite
a few bucks for some banner advertising. I don't know what Telstra would
have to say about this, but International hosting and URL's might help!

Just putting and slightly more financial/legal angle on an interesting
technical project.

&gt;(The real www.whitepages.com.au sort of does this, but it is slow, and
&gt;the maps
&gt; are only for Sydney at the moment).

Nah, they do Adelaide as well, just not all of it. I've checked my business
and it's there!

Cheers

Alex!

According to the latest official figures, 43% of all
