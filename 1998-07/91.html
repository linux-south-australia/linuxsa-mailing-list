Sorry about the confusion - my problem should have read "Red Hat 4.2 and
5.0" as pointed out by Nikolai.

Hard drive replaced and all sectors verified - no change.

First motherboard was a Gigabyte 440BX twin CPU, but could not find any
drivers for the integrated onboard Adaptec 7895 dual-channel ultra-wide
controller.
Second motherboard was an AOpen 440BX using PCI Adaptec 2940UW controller -
this is where we started having install problems.
Third motherboard was an AOpenn 440LX but this was no different.

Daniel Callan suggested that over 64MB RAM may be a problem, so tried
again - this was definitely better, as installation was completed, but
locked up when put under load copying 200MB data across the LAN.

Finally an Intel Atlanta 440LX motherboard was installed - now everything
seems to work fine, including a VGA card (S3 Virge 4MB) which would not run
in either of the AOpen motherboards.
