&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; 1) If I make the old HDD, a WD Caviar 1 Gb drive, the Master, and the new drive,
&gt; a WD Caviar 4.3 Gb drive, the slave, and put Linux on the slave drive only and
&gt; Windoze on the master drive only, can lilo handle booting linux on the slave
&gt; drive and dos on the master. Have you any suggestions re this cnfig to make sure
&gt; it has the optimum configuration.

Yes.  In fact that's what I used to do for a long time (till I found I
hadn't booted to DOS for over a year and decided to reclaim the wasted
space :).

&gt; 2) Since I now have a clean 4.3Gb drive to play with, what partitions/sizes do
&gt; you recommend I break it up into. I use Linux for business type applications,
&gt; i.e. Applixware (free plug... you should all buy a copy from Geoffrey. Applix is
&gt; damn good) plus all the usual other sundry things everyone seems to do with
&gt; Linux.

(aside: You are right, Applix is really good).
As far as partitioning is concerned, this is a source of periodic
religious war on the various mailing lists I belong to.  Normally sparked
by some poor innocent wandering blindly into the minefield :).

However all agree you need _at least_ two partitions... one for swap, and
a root partition (called /).  After that the disagreements start.
Me, I feel that anyone who dosn't provide a seperate /home partition isn't
being very wise.  If you have the avaliable space (and you do), a
/usr/local (or /opt) partition is higly recommended.

Why?  Well eventually you will probably want to reinstall/change
distributions/recover from a failed upgrade/etc.  Now convention (and the
FHS) dictate that the OS vendor shouldn't install anything under
/usr/local, or /home, so when you want to reinstall you simply umount
/home and /usr/local, do the reinstall, and remount them later.  Then all
you users data, and your carefully compiled applications are left
untouched.

I personally also like to keep a seperate /home/ftp partition (but I'm the
only person I know who does).  This allows me to keep a copy of the
various rpm/deb/tgz's I have installed around on a seperate partition that
isn't touched by a reinstall, can be easilly excluded from a /home backup
(I prefer to have /home/ftp backed up on a different regieme).  This means
I can normally do a clean reinstall, and then apply the various packages I
had installed without having to try and dl them again.

Other things to consider are seperate /usr, /var, /tmp partitions (any or
all or none).  You really should be trying to keep the / partition as
small as possible.  Unix systems really don't like having a corrupt /
partition.  So I have

/ - 25 Mb (enough for /etc, /lib, /bin, /sbin, /dev, /root, /boot).  It
could be smaller, but then I'd be in trouble if I ever ran Netscape as
root.

/usr
/usr/local
/home
/home/ftp
/var - 100 Mb (mail, news, tmp, and log's so dosn't need much)
and /tmp is a symlink to /var/root-tmp
and /opt is a symlink to /usr/local/opt

As far as sizes go, I find 250Mb /home enough for almost all purposes.
Just allocate as much space as you can to /usr and /usr/local.

Of course all this is IMHO, however I do strongly recommend you provide at
least a seperate /home partition as it makes life much much easier.
