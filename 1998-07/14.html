&gt; Hi all,
&gt;     We seem to have a hacker doing the rounds!  I have not managed to
&gt; track down how he got in yet, but I think I will....  Bellow is the bash
&gt; history from his short visit.  He had previously created a directory
&gt; called " " in the /tmp directory.  You can see he has used this directory
&gt; to download some tools.  The tools he has downloaded are to cover his
&gt; tracks.

Hi Steven,

You have my sympathies!  Cleaning up after an attack is no fun at all.

The following applies to anyone running any version of Linux that is
ever connected to the Internet or other network where there are
untrusted people around.  I say "Red Hat" below because I can point
you to the appropriate mailing lists and web sites.  People running
other distributions should locate the similar resources for their
distribution.

Are you running named, and if so, what version of named do you have
installed?  If it's &lt; 4.9.7 you should almost definately upgrade.
There is a BIG hole in older versions of bind that allows remote users
to gain local access.  I know of a couple of other people who have
been bitten by this problem, and this would be my guess as to how they
got in to yours.

If you are not subscribed to <A HREF="mailto:redhat-announce-list@redhat.com">redhat-announce-list@redhat.com</A>, do so
now; this is where announcements of security problems (& fixes!)
appear.  Instructions on how to subscribe are available at
<A HREF="http://archive.redhat.com/regular-posting-3.html.">http://archive.redhat.com/regular-posting-3.html.</A>  Also, the errata is
kept at <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/errata/">http://www.redhat.com/errata/</A> if you want to make sure that
your system is currently up to date with known bugs & security
problems (this is a _good idea_).

&gt;     I will have to completly rebuild the system again as I can not be that
&gt; sure what has been tampered with.  Maybe its about time I took a closer
&gt; look at tripwire!

You may not have to rebuild your system.  If you're running an
RPM-based system, you can verify installed packages against either
RPM's database or the original package file.

To verify a package against the RPM database:
  rpm -V package
To verify all packages against the RPM database:
  rpm -Va
To verify a package against the original package <A HREF="file:">file:</A>
  rpm -V -p package.i386.rpm
To look for all files in /bin that aren't owned by any package:
  rpm -qf /bin/* | grep 'not found'
  (you should do the same for at least /dev, /sbin, /usr/bin,
  /usr/sbin, and /usr/X11R6/bin as well)

Of course, an intruder may have modified your RPM database to make the
file checksums match up, so it may be safer to verify against your
original packages from the Red Hat CD.  Also, tripwire is only really
necessary for data files, configuration files, and local binaries; RPM
can easily take care of the majority of your binaries (but if you plan
to do this right, apply the same care to your RPM database as to your
Tripwire database).

'find' can also be useful to locate files that were modified on or
after the day of the intrusion.  Look for files with the ctime or the
mtime matching that day or after.

Sidenote: All files under Unix have three times associated with them:
    atime is the last time the file was read ("accessed")
    ctime is the last time the status of the file was changed
    mtime is the last time the file was modified.
  The mtime is what ls displays by default.  It is trivial for an
  attacker to reset the mtime backwards to make it appear that the
  file hasn't been modified.  It is a lot harder to change the ctime
  backwards (utime(2) only allows changing the atime and mtime).

Note that the above hints should pick up nearly everything that
someone may have done if their expertise isn't much beyond untarring
lrk3 and installing it (and this IMO applies to most people who don't
respect the privacy of other's systems esp. those who leave
.bash_history files around), but to be certain you would need to do a
reinstall.

&gt;     Please all take note of this warning!!!  Check your logs and
&gt; investigate anything abnormal, no matter how insignificant it might seem.

Two other very important warnings:

- Don't run any services you don't need to.  If you don't need imapd,
  don't run it.  If you don't need named, don't run it.  If you don't
  need inetd, don't run it.  (etc).  The idea behind this is that your
  system cannot be compromised by someone exploiting a bug in a
  service that you're not running.  The fewer services you run, the
  fewer potential bugs & exploits available for an attacker to try.

- Stay current with the Red Hat errata.  I mentioned the errata
  before, but this is really important.  I know of a number of
  compromised systems that wouldn't have been compromised had the
  system administrator kept up to date with the errata packages.
