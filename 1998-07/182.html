&gt; &gt; We have a 'customer' who is located in our building who would like to
&gt; &gt; get a direct cable to our bandwidth ( twisted pair ethernet ). I have
&gt; &gt; been thinking about different ways of how to account for this. I know
&gt; &gt; that a firewall can account for packets going to a certain ip address,
&gt; &gt; but am not sure how it does this or in what format. I know routers can
&gt; &gt; also do this, but once again I am not sure in what format. Can anybody
&gt; &gt; enlighten me, make sugestions, or point me in the right direction.
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; 
&gt; If you set everything up right you can use a switched ethernet backbone
&gt; (such as a cat 19xx) then use snmp stats to do the billing. There are also
&gt; security issues if you put that customer on your main collision domain !

That essentially was my first idea but how accurate is snmp stats ? Also
the security isnt all that great....

&gt; 
&gt; Another way to do it is to slide another ethernet card into a linux box
&gt; and then do byte accounting on the interface - this gives you the byte
&gt; counters as well as putting a routed interface in the way that you can
&gt; realistically do firewalling on and by nature filters out broadcast
&gt; traffic from your production network incase it leaks onto their network.
This is my prefered method but currently we dont have a spare machine to
do this with...
which actually brings me to the question, what is the price diffence
between the two solutions...  or at least the cost of a 'cat 19xx' ?
