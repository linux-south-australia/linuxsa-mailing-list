3 Mini-Projects that people might want to get involved with.
They are all extremely Adelaide specific, so it is no good looking for
volunteers on usenet.

Mini Project 1:  Telstra White Pages CD Reader
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have just got a copy of the Telstra WhitePages CD. Available from
various places like Dick Smith for $19.95

There is 1 monster 570MB file called book.dat that looks like it
contains
all the data, with an embedded index up front.

Unfortunately, I am on a Windows NT box at the moment, and there
are no useful tools on this OS of the Future to view a file of that
size.

I will be making use of the data for pre-loading customer names,
addresses
and phone numbers for the pizza thing (so a new site can be installed
with all potential customers for a suburb pre-installed - cool hey ?)

To acheive this I will need to backwards engineer the data format, and
the
index format. Anyone gone down this road already to save me some work ?
At least if I have the data format I can load it into postgres and let
postgres
worry about the indexing details.

Once I have cracked the format, I will write a little GTK+ app that any
linux
user can use to view and search white pages data. I will mail this back
to Telstra in
the hope that they will include it on the CD, (which I seriously doubt),
but
will GPL the code anyway and load it up on <A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu.">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu.</A>

Anyone else have the CD and would like to be involved in this
mini-project ?

Mini Project 2 - Fullers Street Directory CD
---------------------------------------------------------------

On a similar note, there is a Fullers street directory CD of Adelaide
that includes
digitized gifs of all maps, and an attached database to xref street
details with 
map locations. Some sites on the map also have little pop-up gifs with a
photo
of that site. As you may guess by now, I would also like to include a
cross reference
to this data in the Pizza system, so that on entering a phone number, a
pop-up 
map with the location can be displayed. Relatively simple thing to do,
but is has
a pretty big wow-factor.

The mini-project will involve a stand-alone linux based viewer and
searcher for 
the Fullers CD. 

The Fullers CD is available from the Map Shop, for $69.95

All code will be GPL'ed

Mini Project 3 : Turn-Key Linux based Intranet engine for Adelaide
Businesses
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------

Imagine this scenario :

1)	Get a linux box. An AMD-300 Mhz with 4 GB disk, 64MB RAM comes
in at
            around $1600
2)	Load Linux + Postgres + Apache (all standard features of RH 5.1
!)
3)	Having both the white pages + street directory data loaded onto
a single SQL database,
	Add a few simple search screens to the local website that allows
remote users
	to make queries based on name, address, phone, suburb, etc,
	Return a web page that includes all details, + the map details.
4)	Plug the box into an existing corporate intranet, viola !
instant local search engine
	with a unique cross reference between phone book data and map
data.

(The real www.whitepages.com.au sort of does this, but it is slow, and
the maps
 are only for Sydney at the moment).

You now have a plug-in server that any business can add to it's
intranet. This would
give the company a useful internal search engine, and save money on
having their 
staff accessing the real web to look up whitepages.com.au. I imagine
that such
a system would also have broad appeal to a lot of smaller businesses.

You could sell a turn-key bundled, plug in server for a very low amount
and still 
make a healthy profit.

All code will be GPL'ed

After completion of the project, anyone will be free to sell such a
system to
whoever they please, and without any royalties or obligations. 

If there is enough volume sold to local businesses, it would go a long
way
to raising awareness of Linux, and create great new opportunities for 
Linux support and add-products in this little town.

(uh .. Linux based General Ledger / Accounting server using HTML/Java
      clients anyone ?)

Food for thought..

'A group of MS engineers were having a drink after work. One of them
swallowed
an ice cube which then stuck in his throat. He started turning blue as
the other
MS engineers argued about what to do. As he turned purple, they decided
on a 
solution .... they grabbed the kettle and poured a big dose of boiling
water after
the ice cube ..   That ought to solve the problem !'
