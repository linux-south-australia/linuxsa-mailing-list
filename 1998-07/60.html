This is the mount I take it. You should see some of the mounts I have had,
recently I had a HD muonted with a 3.5 inch floppy box under one end and
the shroud for the pc speaker under the other :)


&gt; Linux running so that i dont have these hassles. atm i have IDE0=1.2G HDD,
&gt; IDE1=FREE, IDE2=CDROM, IDE3=LS-120 drive. Where 0 and 2 are masters and 0
&gt; and 3 are slaves. It would seem that the ls-120 will say that it is D, (DAMN
&gt; I have to edit the [insert expletive here] again.

A friend of mine from HUMBUG has an ls120 running in his computer, linux
just treats it like another HD all you have to do is put the disk in it an
mkfs.ext2 the drive, in your case /dev/hdd . Then mount and unmount it as
you want just like any other block device, remembering that it is a
partitioned device so use hdd1 and so on.
