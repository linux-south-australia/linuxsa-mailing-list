&gt;I have found two more systems that have been attacked in the last two days
&gt;by the same thing.  One was running RedHat 4.1 another 4.2 and the last
&gt;5.0
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A fourth system copped a 390MB core file via named but this system was
&gt;running on RedHat 3.0.3 .....  I have now updated to bind 4.9.7 on 5
&gt;different systems including one in the US
&gt;
&gt;Two of the systems were interested in IRC one, mine, was a little more
&gt;complicated with system utils replaced and the fourth was untouched appart
&gt;from the one very large file.

My RH5.0 system was hacked a couple of weeks ago, presumably through the
Bind bug. New user accounts with no passwords were created, and an IRC
bot/proxy was installed on my PC.
I also run an RC5 client with distributed.net, and guess what? The email
address was changed -- presumably to the address of whoever the hacker was ;)
I have emailed the person listed as the admin/tech contact for the domain -
so far no response.
Incidentally, I have logs of connections coming from atlanta.mci.net on the
fake accounts.

General: Let's assume that Holland attacks NATO...
Captain: I think Holland is part of NATO.
General: It is? Damn. Who's not on our side yet?
Captain: Ummm... Switzerland?
General: Great. We'll kick their little lederhosen butts!
