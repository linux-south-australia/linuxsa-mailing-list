Hello, it would seem that i am presently biting the bullet so to speak.

I have seen KDE as a screen shot in a magazine and like what i see. It
appears more of a "pretty" X window manager.

I believe that it comes with one of the RedHat distributions, i would like
someone to confirm this for me. Geoffrey will do seeing as he sells it.

It appears to me now that RedHat is the most dominant force in Linux
distributions in Australia and Adelaide and thus probably the one that ppl
can help the most with when i run into trouble.

I would like to use it for e-mail, news, and Web Browsing as well as a good
deal of study. I would like to use the latest versions of wine (they are
actually getting pretty good atm). Probably a little program development
(yeah simple things atm but who knows...). I would like to use X running KDE
for a majority of this (as it uses my new monitor better than the command
line does).

Will i run into problems with the Glibc5 and the Glibc6 problem? How do i
allow for apps to use their lib and no the other lib to lessen problems,
WINE i know has problems with this. Also seeing as i'll prolly wish to
distribute my apps what about the users that don't use a Glibc6 system?

I have a P133 overclocked to 150, 16MB ram, 2MB vid and a CDROM, a 33.6
modem. There will be in three or four days an LS-120 disk drive (super disk)
and a HDD of 1.2 Gig.

Presently i am using 100% of my partition for win as a FAT32 partition, i am
interestred in filling the last IDE interface that i will have left after my
LS-120 with another HDD all to linux's self. What size should this be with
regard to my wants and what else should i do to my computer?

btw: what is Suse?

Thankyou for reading this and for any help/advice that you can provide!

Malcolm
