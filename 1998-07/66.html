<H1>Trouble with ipfwadm</H1>

Hi Guys

I have just set up a linux box and connected approx 10 Win 95 machines to
it.

Using ipfwadm every Win 95 machine can browse the WWW, collect e-mail and
telnet through the proxy OK.

This is working well and is going to replace the NT machine that was doing
the job.

However one problem has shown up and I cannot figure out where to start
looking.

I cannot send any e-mail messages greater than 1 MB from any machine using
any e-mail package. It eventually times out. I can receive any size e-mail
message but cannot send the mail. It cannot (should not) be my remote smtp
service because the machines still using the Win NT proxy can send any size
mail. It is only the machines using the linux proxy that are having trouble.

The Linux machine is running a fairly standard install of Linux 4.2, had to
recompile the kernal to enable the IP forwarding as per the HOW-TO.
I am not using any of the modules (ftp, icq etc) as I do not need them.
The only rules I am using are:

ipfwadm -F -p deny
ipfwadm -F -a m -S x.x.x.x/x.x.x.x -D 0.0.0.0/0

My question is, have I missed something really obvious (or not so obvious)?

I know I need to create some firewall options to deny incomming traffic but
I am trying to make it work as simply as possible to start with.

Any one have any suggestions?

Thanks in advance

Kevin Hancock
