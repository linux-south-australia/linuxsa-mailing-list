&gt; Hello, it would seem that i am presently biting the bullet so to speak.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to use it for e-mail, news, and Web Browsing as well as a good
&gt; deal of study. I would like to use the latest versions of wine (they are
&gt; actually getting pretty good atm). Probably a little program development
&gt; (yeah simple things atm but who knows...). I would like to use X running KDE
&gt; for a majority of this (as it uses my new monitor better than the command
&gt; line does).

Just a quick note about your monitor - Linux is not DOS/Windows, and has
no silly 80x25 screen size heritage to live down to.

A nice little program called SVGATextMode will let you run your consoles
in all sorts of resolutions, 100x37, 116x40, you name it. Because of the
way video cards work you can also get MUCH higher refresh rates than you
would in X as well, so it's really easy on the eyes.

The greatest thing is that EVERY console program will work in these
'non-standard' modes.

Coding in emacs on a 15" monitor in 100x37 is great. :-)
