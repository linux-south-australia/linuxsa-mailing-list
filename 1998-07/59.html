Well i have finally got the money to get one! YAY!
Unfortunately for me it is a PIG to set up, well i have a sticky tape and
newspaper solution atm.
I can use it from windoze at the same time as my CD-ROM, if i use my CD-ROMS
drivers, but to use it in DOS i requuire its drivers, which my CD hates in
both win and dos. So what has this got to do with linux i hear you all
thinking, well i will tell you: I wish to know if it is possible to set
Linux running so that i dont have these hassles. atm i have IDE0=1.2G HDD,
IDE1=FREE, IDE2=CDROM, IDE3=LS-120 drive. Where 0 and 2 are masters and 0
and 3 are slaves. It would seem that the ls-120 will say that it is D, (DAMN
I have to edit the [insert expletive here] again.

I want none of these hassles! I wish to know if i can use it on Linux prolly
a 2.1G HDD on the free IDE port as slave, keeping win for games. If any one
can help me with advice as how to get the smelly thing working happily with
Linux i would love to hear from you. And to think that i bought it to save
on internet access (to use th uni's connexion). I just want out of windows
and into linux!

Win 98 or not win98 it was a question.
NOT it is a pig to set up, just ask the business that i am doing it for.
