Greetings.

Finally I get to respond instead of ask! :D

We use a lot of automatic ftping to transmit lab results.  I have
attached 
one of the scripts we use ( with all IP addresses, usernames and
passwords missing of course).  However it is still pretty much intact.
It may not be of use as is for you, but it works like a charm for us and
should get you pointed in the right direction.

The file is run through the night with cron and the output is sent to a
log file 
which itself is scanned for any problems.  If there is a problem ( any
line with the 
word error in it ) I have it send me an email describing the problems.
Makes for 
an easier life the next day and helps when the customers complain about
not getting
results.

I hope it helps somewhat,

Dave M.

	Subject:  Automated FTP

	Greetings all,
	A while ago (more than several months) someone had some scripts
for
	running ftp to automatically
	upload (download) from a site...

	I just remember that there were difficulties because ftp expects
input
	from 'stdio' at odd times when
	outputting to'stderr'.

	Does someone out there have a script for uploading file to a
site that
	they are happy with.
	(I wish to use it in a cron job.)

#	This script is designed to execute from crontab as root.
#	It automates the file transfer of exported authorised PbSme assays
#	to the PbSme Office Assay FTP Server (ip: Address ) using
#	the ftp protocol.
#
#  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  Crontab setup should be such that output is captured to a log file. This will
#  be useful for support problems.

#  EOFTP is just a tag and could have been any string. EOFTP was
#  chosen as the string to represent an acronym for End Of FTP. Make sure there
#  are no spaces after it appears on a line of its own. This is called a 'here'
#  document, the document is here in the script, from the &lt;&lt;EOFTP to the line
#  where EOFTP appears on a line on its ownR (with no spaces after it).

#  STEPS:
#  1. Search the LIMS database for authorised PbSme sample assays at 5 pm daily 
#     and append to respective local /lims/export/auto/auth_* files - temporary 
#     concatenated files of sample assays.
#	If the file does not exist, a new one is created.
#  2. Check the remote PbSme Office FTP Server PC is alive at 9 pm daily.
#	If not, then terminate and try again tomorrow.
# 	If the PC is alive, then;
#  3. Remove local *.txt files.
#  4. Get remote data *.txt files.
# 	If no remote file exists, no local file is created.
#  5. Append local auth_* files to respective local *.txt files.
#	If no local auth_* exists, null bytes are appended.
# 	If no local *.txt file exists, append creates a new one.
#  6. Put local *.txt files back to remote.
#	This is the original remote data file plus any new assays.
# 	There will always be a *.txt file. Either, get remote (step 3) or append
#	/create local (step 4).
#  7. Append local auth_* files to local *.arc files and remove auth_* files.
#  8. Put local *.arc files back to remote.
#	This is a remote archive of assays.

#  -------
#  STEP: 2
#  -------
#  Error check that the PbSme Office Assay FTP Server is alive. If the
#  connection is not alive then this script ends. If the connection is alive
#  proceed with the script, if not then terminate.
#  Error check that the PbSme Office Assay FTP Server login account is okay. If
#  the login is unsuccessful this script ends. If the login is successful
#  proceed with the script, if not then terminate.
#  Connect to the PbSme Office Assay FTP Server using the file transfer protocol
#  The ftp command cannot automatically execute the .netrc file because crontab
#  is running this script as root. Root does not have an account that can
#  autoexecute its own .netrc file. To overcome this problem, the file 
#  pbsme.ftp.command? contains all the necessary ftp commands for the
#  connection and is redirected into the initial ftp command. The -n parameter 
#  disables the autologin sequence (because root) and -v displays verbose.

PBSMENAME="IP Address"	

# okay, the reason for this bit is the server maintainer likes tokeep changing the 
# pc name.  We use the name of the pc to check we're getting logged in okay, but 
# when they change it it stuffs things up.  This just makes it easier to change things.
