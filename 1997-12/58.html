&gt; &gt; The Minimum requirements for Running Redhat 5 are listed as:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Intel 386
&gt; &gt; 40 Meg HD space in character mode
&gt; &gt; 100 Meg HD space for X
&gt; &gt; 8 Meg RAM
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to those who replied to my query the other day.
&gt; 
&gt; I went ahead and installed RH4.2 on to a 100MB partition and it was
&gt; unsuccessful.  While it claims that the packages I selected would require
&gt; 41MB of space, I suspect it requires some disk overhead for package
&gt; decompression.  The install scripts failed for things like db, and
&gt; e2fsprog.  Finally unpacking the kernel rpm failed and then ld.so.  Then
&gt; it fell over completely with a kernel panic.

No (or at least very little) disk space is required for package
decompression; certainly not 60MB.  During the install, use 'df' on
the second virtual console to watch what it is doing as it installs.

Try selecting no extra components, then installing what you need
after the proper installation.

&gt; I recall having this problem before on another machine with a small HDD. 
&gt; I resorted to Slackware in the end.
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose the thing to do is install it on a larger disk and then just
&gt; cpio it over to the small one.  My new question is, can I do this with one
&gt; EIDE drive and another ESDI drive on another controller?  The small HDD
&gt; happens to be ESDI which just adds another layer of complication.  As I
&gt; recall you can't have an IDE and an MFM controller attached
&gt; simulateneously.  What about IDE and ESDI? 

No idea :).
