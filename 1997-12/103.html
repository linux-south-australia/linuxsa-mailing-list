&gt; Don't be. It's my rather warped sense of humour i'm afraid ;), but i have
&gt; a sensible question now. I need to do some multi-threaded programming with
&gt; the clone() system function (which i've never used before). I'm not sure
&gt; if this was around in 1.2.x (was it around back then?), but i only noticed
&gt; it when 2.0.x came out. 

Most people doing multi-threaded programming can ignore clone. It is much
easier (and portable) to use one of the thread libraries for Linux. People
who are not using glibc based systems generally use linuxthreads instead. 
Glibc has thread support built in.

&gt; - Do you know what standard clone() comes under? (ie POSIX?,BSD
&gt; 4.4?,X/OPEN? etc), or is it just a Linux thing?

Clone is Linux specific.

&gt; - I have libc 5.3.12 and there's no stub for it. I'm looking through the
&gt; libraries at sunsite (version 5.4.38)), and they are all pretty big. I was
&gt; wondering if you knew if 5.4.38 has the clone() stub before i commit to
&gt; downloading it?, and if it does (more importantly), do you know if there
&gt; are any problems with this library?. Thanks. 

There are quite a few system calls (including clone) which don't have
stubs in (g)libc. If you want to use them directly you will have to
improvise a little. The old 'sysinfo' call is also like this. To get
around it do something like:

#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;	/* For the sysinfo struct */
#include &lt;syscall.h&gt;

int sysinfo(struct sysinfo *info)
{
	return syscall(SYS_sysinfo, info);
}

Regards,
Mark
