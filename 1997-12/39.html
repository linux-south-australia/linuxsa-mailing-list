&gt; Ok....I take your point, but in this particular case, I don't mind living

Fair enough.. I'm a little bit of a free software purist, and although I
don't like that propriatrey (sp..) license, I /can/ live with it, if I
needed Qmail's features on my system.

However, Smail on my system is performing perfectly and I have yet to find
a problem about it. I have deleted sendmail off my system after seeing all
the security exploits that have appeared in this cumbersome code that
makes sendmail.

Although fixes have been released, one can only imagine how many
undiscovered exploits there are, lurking in the sendmail code. It's quite
ridiculous to say one program has had over 20 postings to some of the bug
tracking systems! :-(
 
&gt; The source is freely available and may be distributed. I don't think it's
&gt; such a big deal for me to compile/install on a server then forget about it.

Why doesn't the author make up /his own/ binary packages in .deb, .rpm and
.tar.gz and send them out to Debian to include with the statement "No
modifications to this package, please!". It sure would make sense.
 
&gt; No monthly patches or security problems(yet), and no cost.

I can see where you're coming from, but why do you use qmail (restrictive)  
as opposed to smail (free; GPL'ed)?

&gt; BTW... The original posting was about the "nice" bounce messages. I thought
&gt; the messages from the server are a bit on the cutesy side and that part of
&gt; the code is about the only thing I hacked :-)

I wish he had of been sensible on that day he hacked out that section of
code. Qmail runs at core.apana.org.au and whenever some message gets
bounced I have to put up with a computer telling me that he's "sorry it
didn't work out".
