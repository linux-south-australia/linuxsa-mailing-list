&gt; First of all, THANKS for having a place that addresses the newcomers needs.

That is what is there for.  Are there problems with the local Linux 
Users Groups?  I am sure there would be Linux Users Groups in San Fransisco.

&gt; I have Red Hat 4.2, Xfree86(?), and have a  "Swindles95" machine along side
&gt; which I am using now to access this site. I wanted to be completely free of
&gt; MS and need to at least start accessing the net, either send email, which I
&gt; tried with PINE but couldn't get the pine to activate my modem like Eudora

The Red Hat control panel should help you.  Become root under
X-Windows and start 'control-panel'  there is a networking icon that allows
you to set up PPP.  That should help.

Once that is done it should be possible to get Pine to get your mail using
IMAP (anyone else care to help on this one).  And also get pine to send
your mail.

So you will only have to run 'ppp-on' and then run 'pine' to send and receive
mail. (Of course ppp-off to shut ppp down :).

You get used to them eventually.   You should remember the time that DOS seemed
scary....

&gt; great book that has helped me with commands before called UNIX for DOS
&gt; Users which keeps my head above water. I will have the network card (right
&gt; one this time) for my linux machine tomorrow and the my linux friends
&gt; (meetings 2 times a month) will help me so I can at least download Netscape
&gt; thru "Swindles95" then nic it to Red Hat (linux.)

You can get Netscape to download/send mail also.

&gt; PS: Netcom says all it has for me is my DNS numbers to help me access the
&gt; net with linux !!! (?)
Typical !

There should also be a mail host that you get/send mail to/from.
Most ISPs will supply you with about 4 addresses that you can configure
your machine to.
