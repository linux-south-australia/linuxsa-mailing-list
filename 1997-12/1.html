&gt; After avoiding looking into Samba due to misgivings about its
&gt; complexity, I spent about 15 minutes reading docs, about 5 minutes of
&gt; typing and suddenly I'm browsing around on my wife's Win95 machine
&gt; from my Linux box.
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from the net, Windows for workgroups is the only networking
&gt; experience I've had so I'm kind of curious about it all.
&gt; 
&gt; How does Networking with Linux shape up when compared with something
&gt; like Netware or Lantastic?  I just haven't got the money to experiment
&gt; with software like that at home so I have no concept of their
&gt; capabilities.  

Hi John,

I have very little experience with Netware, and I've got no experience
with Lantastic, but I'm sure Samba compares favourably with them as
there are some large Samba installations where the comment was that
Samba was the only thing that would do the job.  For example,
Hewlett-Packard in the US use around 1,000 Samba servers to support
over 100,000 users.  Cisco Systems use Linux and Samba to serve about
1,600 printers worldwide for Unix, PCs, and Macintoshes.  The Samba
docs say that a single Samba server is capable of supporting over
2,000 simultaneous clients.

Regards,
