Thanks to everyone who replied.

&gt; What type of authentication are you using Client-Server? Is it just
&gt; password or is it chap/pap?

Just password. I get a shell prompt to login at and then ppp starts
automatically at my ISP end.

&gt; Don't have web access ATM -- I'm offline. Can you please send me your
&gt; logs?

Sent, in a separate email.

&gt; Or, have you (Peter) thought of using SLIP instead of PPP?

I don't think Hal9000 wants users using SLIP (since ppp is easier for
them to set up and admin), but I'll ask.

&gt; By the way, hal9000 was a strong participant of APANA over twelve
&gt; months ago as was Mark Newton.

Yes, I joined up with them when they were hal9000.apana.org.au

&gt; ijppp is implemented entirely in userland.  It works by attaching
&gt; itself to an IP-tunnel network interface then encapsulating and
&gt; de-encapsulating packets between the interface and its controlling
&gt; terminal.  That's the version that I believe almost everyone is
&gt; using with FreeBSD.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, both versions support Predictor-1 compression.  When predictor-1
&gt; is enabled, however, Linux PPP and FreeBSD ijppp cannot talk to each 
&gt; other.

This sounds like my problem. As hal9000 starts ppp I see (or used to)
messages regarding device tun1 - the IP-tunnel interface mentioned above
(?)
