&gt; &gt; &gt; Opera's claim-to-fame is that it is **very** small, full-featured,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and doesn't come from either of the big behemoths. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; People might shoot me down in fames here, Why don't more people use
&gt; arena?. It's small too, But the thing i like most about arena is that it's
&gt; GPL, which is in the Linux spirit of things.

It is free, but I thought it was the W3C reference implementation.

*QUICK RESEARCH ....*

It *was* the W3C reference implentation.

It has now been taken over by Yggdrasil (Does anyone know the 
proper pronunciation?).  This happened in Feb 97.

&gt; The reason why it's not very good, is probably because nobody is
&gt; supporting it (ie using it, and emailing the author telling him how nice
&gt; he is for developing a program free of charge etc). If more people used
&gt; it, then maybe it would encourage the author to make it better?.

Check out

You can also now contribute to it.

Since it is now under a similar development cycle to samba et al, it should
be pretty interesting.
