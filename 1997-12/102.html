Don't be. It's my rather warped sense of humour i'm afraid ;), but i have
a sensible question now. I need to do some multi-threaded programming with
the clone() system function (which i've never used before). I'm not sure
if this was around in 1.2.x (was it around back then?), but i only noticed
it when 2.0.x came out. 

- Do you know what standard clone() comes under? (ie POSIX?,BSD
4.4?,X/OPEN? etc), or is it just a Linux thing?

- I have libc 5.3.12 and there's no stub for it. I'm looking through the
libraries at sunsite (version 5.4.38)), and they are all pretty big. I was
wondering if you knew if 5.4.38 has the clone() stub before i commit to
downloading it?, and if it does (more importantly), do you know if there
are any problems with this library?. Thanks. 

See ya
