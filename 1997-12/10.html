&gt; &gt; Dear MLUG member,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Opera Software is currently looking at the feasibility of porting
&gt; &gt; their "Opera" web browser to platforms other than Windows.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Opera's claim-to-fame is that it is **very** small, full-featured,
&gt; &gt; and doesn't come from either of the big behemoths. :-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; They currently have over 1100 pledges each for MacOS and OS/2.
&gt; &gt; The Linux pledges are just over 400, and the BeOS camp is quite a
&gt; &gt; bit over 200.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How come an operating system with an estimated install base of
&gt; &gt; 5 million can only muster 400 pledges, when a piddler like BeOS can
&gt; &gt; nearly match it?
&gt; &gt; 

I think I can answer this one.  I had never heard of opera, or their offer
to port to linux.  This puzzled me as I would normally have heard of this
as I am subscribed to about 7 linux related mailing lists, a regular user
of linpeople, and a lurker on c..o.l.announce.  Well a search of the
dejanews c.o.l.a archives turned up nothing.  If they aren't going to
advertise, then they aren't going to get the response they were looking
for.  Looking at their web page it seems that they enlisted the aid of a
few "names" in the Apple and BeOS community.  So I feel their analysis of
the Linux response to be a little unfair.

That being said I am personally getting fed up with the size, speed, and
stability of netscape.  If Opera lives up to its marketing (I don't have
access to a Win system so I can't check out the windows version), I would
be willing to buy it.  (And the $35 "suggested" price tag is more then
reasonable).

P.S.R. (Post-Script-Rant) 
It continues to amaze me that people assume that just because
Linux users use a free OS, they won't be willing to pay for their
applications.  In Humbug no-one would admit to pirating Linux software.
The social pressure in my local linux community to ensure that piracy
remains a MS problem is huge.  In fact rather then "a user base that's too
used to free software", the general feeling seems to be that having been
given so much, we should be more then willing to give back.  This
expresses itself in the astounding number of free applications avaliable,
the willing technical support provided by all members of the community,
and a rejection of software piracy.  
/P.S.R.
