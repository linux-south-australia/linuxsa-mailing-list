Hi,
I have a number of questions

1. where can I find info on setting up video cards in particular the meaning
of the monitor settings in "XF86Config" file, Particularly how to work out
HTimings and VTimings and how do I change the vertical refresh rate.
        Is this information included in the RedHat 5.0 distribution?

2. Network card, I cannot seem to get mine to work, does this have to be set
up from the shell or can it be done from X, under X what does "Network
Configurator" do also Also "Kernel Daemon Configuration" are these the areas
to get the network card going?

3. establishing a ppp connection, I seem to have got my serial port to work,
linux will dial out but nothing works from then on, applications in X seem
to freeze, how do I monitor the progress of a ppp dial up in order to debug
it, what am I supposed to see when there is a successful connection?

4. Sound Card can't seem to get any sound to work.
reading one of the sound info files said look at dmesg | Less
I found a line as follows

Soundblaster audio driver Copyright ---etc
Installed 0

What does the "Installed 0" bit mean?

I realize these are "Biggies" I hope to get several answers even if you can
only help with one of the above questions all advice much appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
Paul OBrien
