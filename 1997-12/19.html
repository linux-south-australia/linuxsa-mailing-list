&gt;&gt; Has anyone else played with the KDE Desktop?
&gt;
&gt;Yes I have. It's quite nice, with one execption.. The Window Manager. I
&gt;like the file manager, the mail program, and everything else, except I
&gt;don't like (read hate) the wm. 

Yes, the file manager with its file viewing capabilities which include
well laid out html, is very nice.  The "Bookmarking" feature for files
and directories was strangely reminiscent of "Open Desktop".  For some
reason it seems great on KDE but a pox on the "other operating
system".

Kmail is probably the most sophisticated looking MUA I've seen on a
Linux machine but incredibly buggy at this stage. It seems to get
confused about how many messages I have in my inbox, occasionally
exits when I check for mail in /var/spool/mail/xxx and stores messages
in a format that I can't read with Pine, TkRat or Forte Agent. (I
never have settled on a favourite MUA with linux and I've tried a few)

The window manager I think is probably a bit too user-friendly for
your average Linux person and is likely to be condemed as a newbie WM.

This is the first time my wife has ever looked over at my machine and
said "that's nice, what is it?"  Of course as soon as I said it was
running on Linux she groaned and promptly forgot it.
