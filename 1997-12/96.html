<H1>Mouse Problem</H1>

<PRE>
When I first installed Red Hat Linux 4.2 on my machine, I had a problem
with my mouse in X - namely it wouldn't work.  Apparently there was some
sort of clash with the Linux mouse server gpm and the X mouse driver. 
Geoffrey fixed it for me at the time but I'm not sure how.  I have just
upgraded to Red Hat 5.0 and the same problem has reoccurred.  I have
managed to get around it by inserting 'exit 0' into the beginning of
/etc/rc.d/init.d/gpm which effectively causes gpm to 'bug out' before
doing anything.  However, I have two questions:
1.	Why am I having this problem (has anyone else experienced it?)
2.	Is there a way I can get around this more cleanly than tinkering with
gpm itself.  ie. what initiates gpm at bootup than I can modify to stop
gpm executing?
	These may be basic questions but I am still only a babe in the world of
Linux - any assistance would be appreciated.
