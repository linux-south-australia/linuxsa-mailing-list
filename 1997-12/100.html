&gt; When I first installed Red Hat Linux 4.2 on my machine, I had a problem
&gt; with my mouse in X - namely it wouldn't work.  Apparently there was some
&gt; sort of clash with the Linux mouse server gpm and the X mouse driver. 
&gt; Geoffrey fixed it for me at the time but I'm not sure how.  I have just
&gt; upgraded to Red Hat 5.0 and the same problem has reoccurred.  I have
&gt; managed to get around it by inserting 'exit 0' into the beginning of
&gt; /etc/rc.d/init.d/gpm which effectively causes gpm to 'bug out' before
&gt; doing anything.

I fixed the problem by preventing gpm running.  That would have been
either:

Removing gpm (probably the best thing to do if you don't want to use
it):
rpm -e gpm

Or disabling gpm in init levels 3 and 5 (the ones you usually run your
system in):
cd /etc/rc.d
mv rc3.d/S85gpm rc3.d/K85gpm
mv rc5.d/S85gpm rc5.d/K85gpm

&gt; However, I have two questions:
&gt; 1.	Why am I having this problem (has anyone else experienced it?)

Someone else will have to answer this.  What I found on your system
was that gpm and XFree just did not want to co-exist which is a bit
unusual.  The only thing I can think of (I can't remember if I did try
this) is to check that XFree and gpm are both using the same serial
port device (ttyS? as opposed to cua?).  If that doesn't work, try
having both programs use the other device.

&gt; 2.	Is there a way I can get around this more cleanly than tinkering with
&gt; gpm itself.  ie. what initiates gpm at bootup than I can modify to stop
&gt; gpm executing?

See above.
