&gt;                PRESS RELEASE
&gt; 
&gt;                December 10, 1997
&gt; 
&gt; Linus Torvalds Receives 1997 Nokia Foundation Award
&gt; 
&gt; Nokia Foundation has granted its 1997 Award to Linus Torvalds, creator of
&gt; the Linux operating system and one of the most famous young Finnish
&gt; researchers in the area of information technology in the world. The Award
&gt; is worth FIM 50,000.
&gt; 
&gt; Nokia Foundation was formed in 1995 to support the development of
&gt; scientific competence and educational capabilities of information and
&gt; telecommunications technologies in Finland. This year the foundation also
&gt; granted scholarships to 26 post-graduate students and five teams
&gt; supporting interaction between universities and the industry.
&gt; Additionally, the Foundation granted a visiting fellowship to two
&gt; well-known professors to participate in study groups at the Finnish
&gt; universities. The total of the Award, scholarship and fellowship is
&gt; FIM 913,000.
&gt; 
&gt; In selecting the award winner, the Foundation emphasized Linus Torvalds'
&gt; excellent achievements in information and telecommunications technology
&gt; and especially his inspiring example for young researchers. The Linux
&gt; operating system developed by Torvalds is one of the most popular Unix
&gt; operating systems, particularly on PC-based Web servers.
&gt; 
&gt; In his speech today at the Nokia Foundation Grant Holder Announcement
&gt; event, Nokia President and CEO Jorma Ollila emphasized  the importance of
&gt; education, research and development in maintaining the competitiveness of
&gt; the Finnish telecoms industry. He commented that study time is too long
&gt; in Finland: "If we could shorten the study time by one year, for example,
&gt; and spend that time on effective research and development work, we would
&gt; remarkably strengthen our national competitiveness".
&gt; 
&gt; "This cannot mean sacrifices in quality," Ollila emphasized,
&gt; "shortening the study time means making studies more effective, and not
&gt; lowering their quality. This supports the way to learn to learn new
&gt; things more in depth - a skill we will all need more and more often in
&gt; the future. We will really need people with capabilities to learn and
&gt; take in new things rapidly," Ollila noted.
&gt; 
&gt; According to Ollila, increasingly more distinct goal setting and rapid
&gt; enter to the market will be also increasingly more necessary for the
&gt; research and development work. This should be evident in the internal
&gt; projects of companies as well as in the public-funded projects.
