====================================================================

December 1, 1997

RTP, NC -- Red Hat Software, Inc. is pleased to announce the
availability of Red Hat Linux release 5.0 for Intel and Alpha
computers.  This release is a major update to the Red Hat Linux 4.X
series, which won InfoWorld's 1996 Desktop Operating System of the Year.


NEW AND NOTABLE FEATURES IN RED HAT LINUX 5.0
=============================================

. Easy installation. 
  Most modern hardware is detected and configured automatically.  
  Smart and intuitive network configuration with bootp,  NFS mounts 
  (share /usr between machines, for example).

. Simple disk partitioning.
  The 5.0 installation system includes DiskDruid, a new, full screen
  tool that eases the job of creating partitions on your hard drives.
  DiskDruid can automatically allocate partitions to drives that have
  space, and can expand partitions to fill drives.  The result is you
  use your hard drive space much more efficiently.

. KickStart installation.
  The KickStart installation mode allows you to define all the
  parameters for an installation (or upgrade) in a file that you place
  on your installation server or boot floppy.  All you need to do is boot 
  the target machine with the boot floppy and walk away - KickStart does 
  the rest!  This feature makes it easy to install dozens or even hundreds
  of machines.

. GNU libc.
  Glibc is the new standard Linux C library.  It has vastly improved
  support for internationalization and threads.  Many users also report
  noticeable performance improvements.

. Increased security.
  Red Hat leads the industry in producing the most up to date security
  features.  By updating to the latest versions of sendmail, Apache,
  named, inn, and others, 5.0 maintains this lead.

. Enhanced stability.
  Red Hat excels as a highly available, high performance Apache web
  server in extremely demanding environments.  
  Run your workstation with more confidence and fewer headaches.  

. Modular 2.0.31 kernel (with patches).
  One kernel for all hardware, and support for much more hardware. 
  The kernel includes modular sound card drivers, and a configuration tool
  that can easily configure your SoundBlaster cards - no more recompiling
  the kernel!  The updated kernel includes many security and stability 
  updates, and is distributed as an RPM package.  This means that to upgrade 
  the kernel you only need to upgrade the kernel RPM packages.

. Improved X Windows support.
  XFree86 3.3.1 supports more cards (including Matrox Millenium and
  #9 Imagine 128), with better acceleration.  Easier X Windows                 
  configuration.  In many cases just pick your monitor from the provided      
  list and you are done.

. Reworked Red Hat Linux Installation Guide 
  Over 300 pages of installation and configuration information.  Complete   
  coverage of the control-panel tools, including the network, user/group,
  and printer tools.  Covers basics and configuration of PAM security
  architecture.  The User's Guide is available via FTP and it is also
  browsable on our web site!

. Improved network configuration.
  Improved graphical network configuration control panel tool.  Allows for
  simple configuration of PPP network connections.  Multiple device 
  configuration makes it simple to move your machine between networks, add 
  ethernet cards, etc. Supports PAP authentication for PPP connections, and 
  allows multiple configurations for individual network devices (eg, a 
  local and a long distance configuration for your PPP connection).

. User Control Panel Tools.
  Graphical tools for non-root users include a network activation tool
  (makes it easy to manage PPP links), a tool to simplify mounting and
  formatting floppy disks, as well as tools to set your password and
  other user information.

. Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM).
  New version of PAM, 0.59, is used throughout for increased system
  security and configurability.  Shadow password, MD5 password support,      
  and other authentication methods are supported.

FEATURES OF RED HAT LINUX 5.0
=============================

* Installation

Our installation system keeps getting better and better.  By
presenting simple fill-in-the-blank forms, and applying intelligent
automation to network, package, and module configuration, the system
relieves you of the most tedious and most troublesome aspects of
installation.  New with 5.0 is hardware autodetection and KickStart.
The 5.0 installation will automatically detect and configure most
modern hardware.  KickStart is an installation mode that is driven
from a configuration file on a NFS/bootp server or the boot floppy, 
allowing unattended installations and upgrades.  Installation is 
supported via CD-ROM, NFS, FTP, and from hard drives, and includes 
seamless PCMCIA and PLIP support.

* Package Management

The RPM package system is designed to be powerful yet easy to use.
These design features, along with smart config file handling across
package upgrades, "shared" file handling, documentation searching
support, package installation via FTP, dependencies, and powerful
querying, make RPM the most advanced package system available.

With our graphical package manager, Glint, you can track every package
installed on your system, and all packages available on the CD-ROM.
You can examine package descriptions and file contents before you
install them.  With a few mouse button clicks you can install,
uninstall, list and verify all installed packages.  No other
installation system comes close.

* Configuration Tools

The Red Hat control panel tools cover configuration of your network,
printer, filesystem, users and groups, SysV init, time and date, and
modem.  PPP and SLIP configuration has never been easier!  New with 5.0
is the ability to set up and choose from multiple configurations for
your network devices, which allows increased mobility.  For the first
time, Plug-n-Play Sound Blaster cards are configurable as well, with the
new sound config tool. 

* Compatibility between Linux Platforms

The Red Hat Linux 5.0 for Intel and Alpha products are built from the
exact same source packages.  This ensures maximum ease of software
portability between machines running Red Hat Linux regardless of the
underlying hardware architecture.  In addition, your investment in
configuration of Red Hat Linux will pay off on both platforms.

* License Terms

Red Hat Linux is distributed under the terms of the GPL, and is freely
available from our FTP site, and dozens of mirrors.  

The Red Hat Linux Installation Guide and the new RPM book "Maximum RPM" 
are also available freely, under the following license:

  The material contained within the publication may be reproduced and 
  distributed in whole or in part, in any medium, physical or electronic, 
  so long as this copyright notice remains intact and unchanged on all
  copies.  Commercial redistribution is permitted and encouraged, but 
  you may not redistribute it, in whole or in part, under terms more
  restrictive than those under which you received it. 
====================================================================


STANDARDS, TESTING, AND RED HAT LINUX
=====================================

Red Hat Linux continues to track both Linux and UNIX industry
standards closely.  Red Hat Linux conforms to the Linux File System
Standard (FSSTND), and tracks many other Linux and UNIX standards.

Testing is probably Linux's greatest strength and the origin of its
remarkable stability for most applications, and Red Hat Linux benefits
from this.  The truly open development model followed by Linus
Torvalds and the Linux development community allows new releases of
the kernel, components, and distributions to be tested by hundreds of
thousands of users. Their access to everything at little or no cost,
including full source code, from many sites on the Internet enables
anyone to contribute to further development by not just reporting bugs
but contributing patches.

Red Hat Linux depends on this open development model.  We post Red Hat
Linux as "freely redistributable" software for free download off of many
sites on the Internet, and we are grateful for the valuable assistance
we receive.

A STABLE SOFTWARE PLATFORM AND A RAPIDLY EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY
============================================================

Red Hat's software packaging system (RPM) provides the reliable and
consistent installation on a stable environment that ISV's are looking
for, and yet allows for a flexible environment for further Linux
development.

RPM's advanced software packaging features enable RPM packaged
software to be installed easily and correctly on any Red Hat Linux
platform.  Running older software versions on a new release of Red Hat
Linux is generally reliable and trouble free.

FREELY REDISTRIBUTABLE SOFTWARE
===============================

Red Hat Linux is released as freely redistributable software under the
terms of the GPL.  This allows anyone to use Linux without restriction
and to contribute to Linux development.  It also prevents anyone or
any corporation from restricting access to Linux or Linux source code.
Commercially licensed software can be ported to Linux while
maintaining the license terms that the author uses for any other
platform.

====================================================================


RPM - RED HAT PACKAGE MANAGER
=============================

After installing Red Hat Linux once, you will never need to reinstall
Linux again!  Our RPM packaging system is sophisticated enough to
allow upgrading to new Red Hat Linux releases without reinstalling
your system - no partitioning, no backing up all your files, no
headaches.

Red Hat Linux 5.0 is built on a third generation packaging system
called RPM.  The RPM system features include smart configuration file
handling across package upgrades, "shared" file handling,
documentation searching support, and package installation via FTP.
You can install, uninstall, query, verify, and upgrade individual RPM
packages.

RPM is also a powerful software building tool.  It supports reliable,
reproducible builds on multiple platforms.

The RPM web site, <A HREF="http://www.rpm.org">http://www.rpm.org</A>, contains more information on RPM
and the RPM-HOWTO, which describes how to use RPM and build your own
RPM packages.

A graphical package management tool called GLINT allows you to quickly
and easily manage and track your system.  It displays a hierarchy of
packages represented by individual package icons, and displays
progress meters during installation.

We are releasing RPM under the terms of the GPL and we would like to
encourage everyone to use it to package their software.  You can get 
RPM separately from Red Hat Linux from our FTP site.

PRISTINE SOURCES
================

An important element of the design of Red Hat Linux is our commitment
to the concept of "pristine sources".  Our RPM source packages include
pristine, untouched sources, as well as patches and a control file
which defines the building and packaging process.  It enables us to
work with other members of the Linux development community easily and
effectively by clearly separating and documenting the code that they
contribute from any modifications that are required by Red Hat Linux.

====================================================================


FTP AVAILABILITY
================

Red Hat Linux is available for the Intel and Alpha on our FTP site:

    <A HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/redhat-5.0">ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/redhat-5.0</A>

Many sites mirror the Red Hat FTP site, and may give you much better
performance.  A list of these mirrors is at:

    <A HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/MIRRORS">ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/MIRRORS</A>

(Note that the Metro X server, BRU-2000, and the Real products are not 
 available via FTP.  These packages are only available with the full
 boxed set product. Red Hat 5.0 is available for ftp as of December 1.)

RED HAT SOFTWARE WEB SITE
=========================

The Red Hat Software web site, <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com">http://www.redhat.com</A>, contains a
wealth of helpful information, as well as a web-based ordering system
for all our products.

Of particular interest is the support section of the web site, which
includes archives of our mailing lists, errata, Red Hat TIPS, the LDP
documentation, and lots more.  See <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support.">http://www.redhat.com/support.</A>

COMMERCIAL COMPONENTS
=====================
Red Hat makes a single user license to these commercial components 
available as part of our "Official" Red Hat Linux boxed set:

. BRU 2000 Personal Edition.
  The personal edition of BRU 2000 is included in the boxed set product.
  this easy to use graphical backup system takes the pain out of doing
  regular backups.

. Metro-X 4.1
  Metro Link's popular and easy to configure X server is available 
  as an alternative to XFree86, for those Linux users who have trouble 
  with installing and configuring the graphical X server tools on their 
  particular video card.

. Real Media server/encoder and Real Video 5.0 client.
  Real Network's technology for delivering streaming audio on the net is
  becoming a defacto standard.  Red Hat and Real Networks are now helping
  to bring that multimedia standard to Linux.  The client and server (5-
  stream license) are included in the Official Intel product.

UPGRADING
=========

All previous releases of Red Hat Linux (2.0, 2.1, 3.0.3, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2) 
can be upgraded in place (without reformatting or repartitioning).  For
those who want to upgrade, but do not want to purchase the full boxed
set, the Red Hat Linux PowerTools/Archives 6 CD-ROM set is the right
choice.  The PowerTools/Archives set includes a $1 donation to the FSF
as well.

Red Hat Linux for the Intel and Alpha is available on the
Powertools/Archives set (Metro X, BRU, and Real Media products  are only
available with the full boxed set).

Any other questions regarding upgrades can be directed to the Red Hat
sales staff at (919) 547-0012, or 1-888-REDHAT1.
