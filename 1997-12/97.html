Hi all,

I have another kind of mouse problem. In my case, 3B mouse works perfect
in console but I can just emulate 3B in X. I could not fix it to work
with mouse system. I have looked around a lot of HOWTO's including
Geoff Short's one but I have not succeeded as yet. Any recommendations
would be appreciated. Currently I have installed RedHat 5 but I had similar
problem in RedHat 4.1

&gt; 
&gt; When I first installed Red Hat Linux 4.2 on my machine, I had a problem
&gt; with my mouse in X - namely it wouldn't work.  Apparently there was some
&gt; sort of clash with the Linux mouse server gpm and the X mouse driver. 
&gt; Geoffrey fixed it for me at the time but I'm not sure how.  I have just
&gt; upgraded to Red Hat 5.0 and the same problem has reoccurred.  I have
&gt; managed to get around it by inserting 'exit 0' into the beginning of
&gt; /etc/rc.d/init.d/gpm which effectively causes gpm to 'bug out' before
&gt; doing anything.  However, I have two questions:
&gt; 1.	Why am I having this problem (has anyone else experienced it?)
&gt; 2.	Is there a way I can get around this more cleanly than tinkering with
&gt; gpm itself.  ie. what initiates gpm at bootup than I can modify to stop
&gt; gpm executing?
&gt; 	These may be basic questions but I am still only a babe in the world of
&gt; Linux - any assistance would be appreciated.
