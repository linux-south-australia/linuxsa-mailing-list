For those of you who read the Tuesday Australian, there 
was an article about how hackers are targetting various
ISPs.  

According to the article the ISP mentioned installed
a WatchGuard FireBox.  This is actually a turnkey Linux
Firewall solution.

Another product that I have seen is from McAfee called
WebWall, which is another firewall solution.  Although
their documentation doesn't directly say that it is 
based on Linux, I have seen an article about about
Network Associates (McAfee + Network General), which
indicates that WebWall is based on Linux.  In the 
web pages there is indications that is it Linux Based.

BTW McAfee released a version of ViruScan for Linux, it
is a bit old now, but it is still on their FTP site.

There is brand name solutions using Linux, albiet by 
stealth.

Just thought people might want to know.

Matt

In short, Linux is being used for commercial
