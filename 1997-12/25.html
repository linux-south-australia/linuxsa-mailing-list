Just before this thread dies... 8^)

I cannot comment on Netware, however, from my (now old) experiences with
Lantastic it was a good (read stable and reasonably featured) network
solution in its day.  However, it was of the LanManager style with you
directly building the protocol stack and was thus reasonably difficult
to configure from scratch.  I have found Samba much easier in this
regard.

Lantastic (at least the DOS version I got going) allowed the sharing of
disks and printers, and also (surprisingly) modems and the like.  It may
have had simple messaging facilities in there as well. I also had a
Windows (3.?) version but I think this was really just a GUI interface
to the original deal.

Anyway, hope this is of use...

Chris

	Subject:  Re: SAMBA and/or other net software

	&gt; After avoiding looking into Samba due to misgivings about its
	&gt; complexity, I spent about 15 minutes reading docs, about 5
minutes of
	&gt; typing and suddenly I'm browsing around on my wife's Win95
machine
	&gt; from my Linux box.
	&gt; 
	&gt; Apart from the net, Windows for workgroups is the only
networking
	&gt; experience I've had so I'm kind of curious about it all.
	&gt; 
	&gt; How does Networking with Linux shape up when compared with
something
	&gt; like Netware or Lantastic?  I just haven't got the money to
experiment
	&gt; with software like that at home so I have no concept of their
	&gt; capabilities.  

	Hi John,

	I have very little experience with Netware, and I've got no
experience
	with Lantastic, but I'm sure Samba compares favourably with them
as
	there are some large Samba installations where the comment was
that
	Samba was the only thing that would do the job.  For example,
	Hewlett-Packard in the US use around 1,000 Samba servers to
support
	over 100,000 users.  Cisco Systems use Linux and Samba to serve
about
	1,600 printers worldwide for Unix, PCs, and Macintoshes.  The
Samba
	docs say that a single Samba server is capable of supporting
over
	2,000 simultaneous clients.

	Regards,
