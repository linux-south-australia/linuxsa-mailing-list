&gt; How does Networking with Linux shape up when compared with something
&gt; like Netware or Lantastic?  

I work with Lantastic and I can tell you that it holds nothing to SAMBA,
for one it is not tcp/ip so the network is hard to fix. It also has a few
file sharing problems. As for Novell Netware I have had experience with it
at uni, it is incredibly slow and from talking to the sys-admins a bitch
to maintain. My boss wants to change to a client server archiecture I will
be recomending one of two solutions, linux server with  SAMBA share
arangment or full linux with nfs mounted drives, as all the work in the
office can quite happily be ported to linux through the use of Flagship
and Calera's WordPerfect I will be recommending the latter, there are less
problems and it is easier to maintain.

&gt;I just haven't got the money to experiment
&gt; with software like that at home so I have no concept of their
&gt; capabilities.  
That is understanable.
