Solverd.  after browsing since about 9am this morning and trying every thing
I can across the answer was so simple i could cry.

name resolve order = wins dns
dns proxy = yes

start chucking entries in /etc/hosts

&lt;sob&gt;  what a waste of a day.

Subject: Statics WINS Entries on Samba?


We have a M$ DHCP server which I'm replacing with a linux one.  I thought
perhaps I could also use the samba WINS on the same box which I have all set
working fine in test mode off the main network.

In /var/cache/samba/wins.dat i see all the entries which we're created
dynamically.  After much reading of the samba mailing list archive the
general consensus is to just add them to the wins.dat file.    Someone said
they have to stop nmb add the entries and restart nmb to stop them getting
overwritten.

I've been playing around and added a new entry to the file and waited a few
minutes hoping that it was possible to add a new machine to it without
restarting any services, but this didn't work.  after a restart it worked.

Surely this is not how it's supposed to be done?  in the M$ WINS server i'm
trying to get rid of I simply chuck new things or change things in the
static mappings and it's instantly available to the clients.  This does not
appear to be the case with how I'm doing this?

Had a good poke though the samba docs as well and found where it mentions
that the lmhosts file does not act as static mappings, but no reference to
where they should sit.

Anyone using samba as a WINS server out there and have this problem?

Regards
Matthew
