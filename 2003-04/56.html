I just did an upgrade from Mandrake 9.0 to 9.1, and it was as smooth as 
anything. I chose "upgrade", the installer took care of the rest. When I 
rebooted I chose my Mandrake 9.0 kernel so I still had 3d support via the 
nvidia drivers, and my desktop (KDE 3.1) loaded up fine, with my old theme 
and colour settings still. 

The control centre looks nicer, the package manager has been improved (it now 
tells you what source it's getting the package from, yay! no more "hmm this 
80MB Program looks good, I hope it's on the cd's" (I'm on dialup)). All the 
mandrake tools have moved to GTK2, so they look nicer with antialiased fonts, 
and nicer widgets. 

I've also installed Mandrake 9.1 on a friends computer, and it was very 
smooth. I set his machine up so he was a DHCP server to 2 windows clients (on 
two separate ethernet cards), and I bridged the two ethernet cards so it 
seemed like one network. The only thing I've had to use the command line for 
was the bridging (and compiling and installing the Nvidia network driver, but 
until the linux kernel gets a binary driver interface, this is always going 
to be a hassle).

The Galaxy theme looks quite nice, though I'm sticking with the KDE Highcolour 
theme on my home computer (just because I'm used to it, and it's fairly 
minimal).

Oh and not to forget, the KDE menu's can now have drop shadows!!!!! :) looks 
very sweet (if you're into that sort of thing :)

Damien
