&gt; &gt;  Innovation is not something that is easy to do in the kind of

And he seriously expects the readers to believe that? He should be helping 
Bush write his speeches &lt;sigh&gt;

&gt; Linux itself is a clone of an operating system that is 20-plus years 
&gt; old. That's what it is. That is what you can get today, a clone of a 
&gt; 20-year-old system. I'm not saying that it doesn't have some place for 
&gt; some customers, but that is not an innovative proposition.
&gt;

And just what difference is that meant to make?  Just when did Windows 
first come out of hiding?

What a load of FUD.

&gt; ... On the server side, you have people who have skill sets 
&gt; and applications on Sun that they want to move now to Intel hardware 
&gt; to save costs.

Really, that is the main reason why Linux is leading the server market 
still?

&gt;  A Linux PC in most countries is a PC in which somebody is being 
&gt; encouraged to pirate Windows.
&gt;
ComputerBank better watch out, they will be accused of supporting piracy 
next simply because they release computers without Windows on them.
&lt;G&gt;
