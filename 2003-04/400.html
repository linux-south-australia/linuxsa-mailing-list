&gt; in time with the music, not sure if the signal processing for that was
&gt; handled in software or in hardware. I would assume hardware.
&gt;
&gt; I'm sure there's drivers lying around for this sort of thing. I read 
&gt; all his

I'm positive I've seen this kind of thing on sourceforge; and there's 
at least one project.

&gt; stuff about Linux gaining ground in embedded devices, POS terminals, 
&gt; etc. But
&gt; when am I going to see it in little 'ol Adelaide? Every POS machine I 
&gt; see is
&gt; running DOS or Windows.

I see loads of Linux based terminals in Sydney and Melbourne (seen 
quite a few reboot; even from the other side of the room, you can quite 
easily distinguish a BSD/Linux bootup &lt;g&gt;).  Yet to see one in 
Adelaide, they probably exist, but everything seems to run on some form 
of Windows.

Open Software use is becoming incredibly common - its fantastic to see. 
  There's been quite a few contracts now where I've had to "extend" or 
"fix" systems currently in place, and its far more interesting doing 
this with a *nix solution.
