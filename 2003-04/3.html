&gt; Despite all the Power Management settings in WinXP being set to Never spin
&gt; the drive down, every day or two the HDD would spin down after just 30
&gt; seconds of inactivity, over and over again.  Nothing would make it stop
&gt; doing this, and it didn't matter whether the laptop was running on battery
&gt; or AC power.  Sure, the drive spins back up again when accessed but this
&gt; introduces a 2 second delay that stops whatever the PC is doing (including
&gt; playing DVDs).  It also can't be doing much good for the drive itself.

&gt; Has anyone else experienced this on their Toshiba laptop?  (or another
&gt; laptop which uses Toshiba drives, such as Dell?)  Does anyone think this is
&gt; a 'standard feature' to keep spinning down the drive even when not requested
&gt; to?  There are no PM settings in the BIOS either.

i had a similar problem on my Toshiba 7200s. I ran one with '98 and the
other with 2000. Installed as per recovery cd. Both systems had IBM 12GB
hdds, but only the 200 systems spun the disk down, very "intermitantly",
even on AC power.  I swaped the disk over to my NEC laptop and never had
the same problem.  The 10GB IBM disk i bought to replace it never did
this.

however, i only ran Linux 2.2 and 2.4 based distros on the 7200 after
the swap. as 2000 no longer suited my purposes.  win98 did not do this,
on the same hardware, nor did any version of linux or freebsd i put on
the 7200. i can only point the finger at win 2000 + 7200.
 
&gt; I will install Linux on this machine if (when?) it's running properly.
&gt; If I install it now Toshiba will just blame Linux for the problems and
&gt; leave it at that.  I'm deliberatly using their WinXP setup with almost
&gt; no third party software installed.

they are rather good at that kinda of headspace...
 
my thoughts are, get a full refund. it does not fill the purpose on
which it was sold to you, and what you were *lead* to believe it was
suitable for. you have rights as a consumer, use them.

get a real laptop, like a dell or a ibook or summat. 

note that i was perfectly happy with the two toshibas i have had.
although one was nicked in London and the other died in "airport
security" and appears not to be claimable on isurance, as they just
didn't want to know... =( but at least its usb and pcmcia slot still
works =) a wireless node it may be one day =P

cheers,

Kim
