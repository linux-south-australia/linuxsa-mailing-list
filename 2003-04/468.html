David,

I don't get your first paragraph at all... You seem to say firewalls can 
make people complacent and therefore firewalls are crap.  This is not a 
problem with firewalls, it's a problem with ill informed admins.

Not everyone can/needs to do everything to protect their network.  A 
firewall is (normally) the cheapest and easiest way to start protecting 
a network. 

Having some security is better than none at all.  Knowing what level of 
security you have is very important.

&gt;&gt;Perhaps you've mentioned this in earlier posts, (since I'm new here),
&gt;&gt;but I'm curious as to why you think "firewalls are mostly useless"?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I tend to agree with Stephen about firewalls.  I have a couple of
&gt;issues with firewalls, and perhaps the most important is that you do
&gt;not need one if the machines behind it are secure.  What firewalls
&gt;can do is give you the sense that your local machines don't need to be
&gt;secure because the firewall gives you total security.  That is quite
&gt;wrong.  What firewalls can do is give you a false sense of security.
&gt;They can make you complacent.  False security is worse than no security.
&gt;Firewalls also do get in the way; that's their purpose.  Many people,
&gt;when the firewall gets in the way, simply poke a hole through it without
&gt;really thinking about the ramifications.  Perhaps they find they can't
&gt;send mail from their favoured email client, so they open up the SMTP port.
&gt;Lookout!  Who knows what buffer overflow is there to be exploited.
&gt;
&gt;I think there is no substitute for locking down each and every machine.
&gt;And if each machine is locked down, a firewall really adds very little.
&gt;It presents, perhaps, an additional obstacle for the hacker to circumvent,
&gt;but as I already said, that comes at the cost of an obstacle to the
&gt;people it is supposed to protect.
&gt;
&gt;One thing that a firewall can do quite well is enforce certain global
&gt;security policies on a network.  I've used them to ensure that all email
&gt;goes through a central email host; which can be used to log incoming and
&gt;outgoing email, and to rewrite addresses so they conform to organisational
&gt;standards.  I've also used them to ensure that intrinsically insecure
&gt;protocols, such as telnet or ftp, are not used; that stops passwords
&gt;being sent in the clear.
&gt;
