As the list descends into silliness regarding this off topic I
must say that I agree with Brian. Anzac Day is remembering the
senslessness of war. We don't  appear to have learnt anything from
history.

The following is extracted from an article written by Rosemary
Pringle in 1983 for "Refactory Girl", but still pertinent today.

"  Anzac Day is supposed to be our national day of mourning for
those who died in war.  Why is it then that those countless women
raped in war are not remembered or mourned?  A silence surrounds
them.  It is not an innocent silence, for our knowledge of their
very existence has been systematically denied and repressed. 
Feminists have attempted to break that silence and to honour the
memory of those women.  In Canberra, Women Against Rape have,
since 1980, marched in memory of “all women of all countries raped
in all wars’.  They have repeatedly stated that their concern is
with non-violent action and that they are there to participate, to
remember and to mourn. 

This action has evoked widespread support from women and a
hysterical over-reaction from a great many men.  The RSL continue
to deny our sincerity and insist that we are there purely to
disrupt. We are accused of treason and treachery, in singling out
Australian servicemen and calling them rapists.  We have never
done that.  They say we do not appreciate the sacrifices of those
who fought for us, or the sufferings of those who waited at home. 
The implication is that we are not ‘real’ women, that is, that we
do not care what happened to the men.  On the contrary we have no
wish to degrade their memories or deny their mourning.  We merely
point out that in every war women have suffered too, in ways that
are little talked about."
