Hello people this is going to sound funny, but just make out that I am a
newbie.
Currently I have an IPCOP box with the card in it and a network card running
(was) fine one the two ISP's I use.
During the easter weekend my normal isp decided to do a lot of work on the
ISP, so I was forced to use airnet which allows DoV (data over voice) to a
standard dial up, there connection is a 64K connection on isdn every time,
how ever my other isp uses 56k isdn, on the ipcop box I have the patch for
56k and it use to work fine, So during this time lots of people where
letting me that I should be using a straight redhat 9 box, the old saying
you build it they will come, well they all left the ship.
So I tryied my harest to get this card to dial in to the two isp's first
started with airnet due to not needing to patch the kernal for 56k, So I
entered the phone number and pasword and username in the network setup area,
then savied all the setting, to force the card to do DoV a v is placed in
front of the number.
Well to my suprise on the reboot every thing lookied like it was work hisax
drivers and so one, the isdn box (telstras) would start to sync then the
line would drop, a quick look at message file for the card and suprise to me
if it is now dialing over seas, it added it +44and some over numbers then my
isps dial up number.
Well after some time for the life of me i could not work it out.
Has anybody got any idea how to get this card from www.traverse.com.au know
as a NetJet card working under redhat and more important the 56K DoV mode
( I dont want to fund the telstra retirement fund at $1.10 per hour).
Because this is what happens if it is not in DoV mode.

Happy Easter
