&lt;snip forwarded mail&gt;

how shall this get flamed? let me count the ways.

1. HTML email, to a linux list known to be hostile to HTML email.
2. Sent to lots of people (no less than 10 plus a mailing list, or 
possibly 9 and 2 mailing lists), with everyone in the To: header, so 
everyone can see everyone else.
3. Already been forwarded 3 or 4 times, with the &gt;s to prove it (and the 
various disclaimers as well).
4. A warning that a small amount of research would have revealed to be 
false, and stupid.
5. An admonition to send it to all your friends!!!1
6. (a symptom of HTML email) - for some incomprehensible reason, it's 
all in italics. actually, that's kinda funny.

All it's missing is bright green text on a pink background, and some 
animtaed GIFs.

I know the nice thing is to leave it go and not start a thread based on 
it, but it's 12:00, I'm at work still, and this was too good to pass on.

Adam, don't be too offended, anyone who submitted something like this to 
any group i'm a part of would get flamed; this was mild ;-). For future 
reference, this stuff is always fake. &lt;www.snopes.com&gt; is a good place 
to start looking.
