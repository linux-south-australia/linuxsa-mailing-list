&gt; Just then, the machines appeared to sync, and I saw the browse list on each other's network.  Thing is, it didn't seem to map properly, as clicking on a computer wouldn't let me get anywhere (NET VIEW would come back with an error).

It's worth keeping in mind that browsing under Windows is unreliable at
the best of times and on a single subnet, it can take up to 15 minutes
for browse list changes to propagate, and up to 52 minutes for old
entries to die.

&gt; Now it's stopped working again, without any configuration changes.

&gt; Logs look somewhat like this:

The router between you and your WINS server isn't doing any packet
forwarding is it? It might be worthwhile using something like NMAP to do
a port scan from the Samba box against the Windows machine (10.10.2.1).
You probably want ports 137,138 and 139 open. Port 445 is also open (as
the previous log message said).

netstat -a on the Windows machine might also help.

The above message (register_name_timeout_response:....) appears to
indicate that the Windows box isn't responding to your WINS requests.
The browsing stuff seems to be working OK though (in that particular log
fragment :-)).

You mentioned previously that you were positive that 10.10.2.1 was the
only machine on the subnet that was the Master browser. How did you
check that? I only ask because a number of Windows operating systems
have a nasty, nasty habit of losing browser elections and becoming the
master anyway (*cough*Windows 98*cough*).

thx,
Matt
