Michael,

&gt; Don't take this as picking on you.

People on LinuxSA wouldn't be hypersensitive, pedantic, sarcastic or
neurotic would they?

&gt; Mandrake is on the brink of bankruptcy.  Buy an official Mandrake
&gt; version and support the company that puts the distro together and
&gt; funds the development of the software that goes in.

I really think that the business model of selling distributions when you
can download them for free (from Internode or Telstra for example) is
bunk. It doesn't make business sense, it's not likely to be profitable
and there aren't enough people who take your stance to make it
profitable.

Besides which, organisations such as ComputerBank and the CSDN-SA also
target clients or recipients who can't even afford to spend $2/CD
because that means there's no food for the children and so forth.

&gt; Everything Linux (<A HREF="http://www.everythinglinux.com.au">http://www.everythinglinux.com.au</A>) and Linux Systems
&gt; Lab (<A HREF="http://www.lsl.com.au">http://www.lsl.com.au</A>) here in Australia both sell official
&gt; versions of both Red Hat and Mandrake.

Anyone is welcome to donate money to the vendors either directly or
through the CSDN-SA; I'm sure the branch coordinator of ComputerBank
wouldn't mind accepting and forwarding appropriate donations to Mandrake
or RedHat.
