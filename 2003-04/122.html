&gt; &gt; &gt; Brian Marr
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am using ALSA, I don't think NVIDIA supply an audio driver for the
&gt; &gt; nforce2. This machine is running a whole bunch of binary drivers: Lucent
&gt; &gt; Winmodem, Nvidia Network Card, and Nvidia Geforce 3 card.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Btw I just tried unloading the nvnet driver and it makes no difference
&gt; &gt; with the burning problem. Haven't gotten another kernel panic yet though.
&gt; &gt; I can reproduce the burning problem consistently:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) Start burning something in k3b, e.g. an iso
&gt; &gt; 2) Attempt to start any fullscreen game, e.g. frozen-bubble
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At this point the game will not start, although it will be in the process
&gt; &gt; list. If you attempt to kill said process it will not die, however the
&gt; &gt; request to kill seems to be queued and the program ends up dying once the
&gt; &gt; burning is finished.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3) wait til burning finishes, or cancel the burning
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At the very instant the burning stops, frozen-bubble will come up.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is the strangest problem I have ever seen. How on earth is burning
&gt; &gt; and switching to fullscreen mode related?
&gt;
&gt; This is quite normal & is not specific to switching to fullscreen.
&gt; Rather, the CD burning process takes precedence over all other CPU
&gt; intense activities. Hence the queuing.
&gt; This is needed to ensure the fifo buffer is kept topped up with data
&gt; while the burning process is happening, & so ensure (to a certain
&gt; extent) that you won't have a failed burn.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Rick
&gt;

This is an athlon XP 2100+. I could play quake 3 arena and the buffer would 
still remain full. I do not have such problems on my home computer (1.4 
Athlon), however I installed Mandrake 9.0 initially and upgraded to 9.1. The 
computer with the burning problem was installed with mdk 9.1 only.

How can I disable this "feature"? I am still not convinced this is a feature. 
As cannon-smash loaded and was playable with no problems (high frame rate 
too). Open office loaded and was fine (surely launching that beast uses some 
CPU). On my home computer with mdk 9.1 I can do just about anything and my 
burns turn out alright.

As far as I'm concerned, this is a bug.
