&gt; That's some nice work Ian :)

&gt; The whole thing begs the question that if you don't in fact use Lindows,
&gt; then why would you be wasting your time on their website to know that
&gt; the poll even exists, yet alone use it.

Because it isn't on the Lindows Web site. It is a stand-alone site that
ostensibly tries to help people find out about Linux and which Linux distro
is for them.

It does say down at the bottom that it is sponsored by Lindows. What it
doesn't say is that it is built by Lindows, owned by Lindows and
deliberately skewed towrds Lindows. 

IMHO the site is a sham and should not be up on the net.

&gt; Btw, couldn't find that nice background :(
&gt; 

I will see if I can find it elsewhere. I have written to the page owner,
perhaps he can point me to the graphic.
Anyway, the picture is of penguins in the Antarctic jumping off an ice
flow. The ice flow has been modified to the shape of the Windows logo ;-)

A perfect background graphic.

Cheers,  Ian
