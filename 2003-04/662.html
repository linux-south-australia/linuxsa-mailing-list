&gt; Damn, been a long day. On a re-read for the third time I see you are
&gt; mapping different user names to different users as well as the domains.
&gt; So yeah, you are going to need to use the alises file.  Time to go eat
&gt; something...

Or the virtual alias maps perhaps??  My understanding is that the alias maps
are only good for local to local address mapping, however if you want
<A HREF="mailto:joeblow@here.com">joeblow@here.com</A> to <A HREF="mailto:joeblow@somewhereelse.com">joeblow@somewhereelse.com</A> type mapping, virtual alias
maps are the way to go (I certainly use them that way with great success but
somebody feel free to correct me).  Also this is not to be confused with
virtual *mailbox* maps which is useful for sending mail to a mailbox that
doesn't necessary tie up with a local unix user (good for hosting mail for
virtual domains with different name spaces for each domain).

Here's a clip from the man page (5) on "virtual":

***********
DESCRIPTION
       The  optional  virtual  alias table specifies address aliasing for
arbitrary local or non-local recipient
       addresses. Virtual aliasing is recursive, and is done by the Postfix
cleanup(8) daemon.

       The main applications of virtual aliasing are:

       ·      To redirect mail for one address to one or more addresses.

       ·      To implement virtual alias domains where all addresses are
aliased to addresses in other  domains.

              Virtual alias domains are not to be confused with the virtual
mailbox domains that are implemented
              with the Postfix virtual(8) mail delivery agent. With  virtual
mailbox  domains,  each  recipient
              address can have its own mailbox.

       Virtual  aliasing  is  applied only to recipient envelope addresses,
and does not affect message headers.
       Think Sendmail rule set S0, if you  like.  Use  canonical(5)  mapping
to  rewrite  header  and  envelope
       addresses in general.

       Normally, the virtual alias table is specified as a text file that
serves as input to the postmap(1) com­
       mand.  The result, an indexed file in dbm or db format, is used for
fast searching by  the  mail  system.
       Execute  the command postmap /etc/postfix/virtual in order to rebuild
the indexed file after changing the
       text file.

       When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP or SQL,
the same lookups  are  done  as  for
       ordinary indexed files.

       Alternatively,  the table can be provided as a regular-expression map
where patterns are given as regular
       expressions. In that case, the lookups are done in a slightly
different way as described below.

Cheers,
Graham
