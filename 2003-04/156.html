Hi Gavin

On Friday nights we meet at David Lloyd's place at 131 St Bernards Rd
Rostrevor from about 7pm onwards. If you can make your way there I can
drop you home again. We meet to talk Linux etc. and help each other out
with problems.

On Saturday we're meeting at my house from 3pm for a drink and a bite to
eat. There would be people there to help you out. 68 Nunyah Ave Park
Holme. We're meeting to discuss the distribution of Linux across South
Australia. Today is BYO nibbles & drinks.

This is our website of our distribution network.

&gt; G'day all.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a Linux newbie and I'd like some help. I'm in Adelaide for a while
&gt; before heading back to Uganda to continue doing Community Development
&gt; work. I've recently purchased a Compaq notebook and I'm running Mandrake
&gt; 9 on it. I've had no experience with Linux until I installed Mandrake a
&gt; couple months ago, and I'd like some help learning more about it. Is
&gt; there anyone out there who would be interested in meeting up with me to
&gt; help me set up my computer the way I want it, and to help me learn more
&gt; about Linux? I'm living with friends at Ferryden Park for the next few
&gt; weeks before I leave, and I don't have a car, but I'm willing to make my
&gt; way to somewhere convenient. I'm keen to see Linux spread in Uganda, and
&gt; I'm involved with a school there and I see Linux as the perfect thing to
&gt; use there. The problem is that at the moment I can't achieve a lot with
&gt; my limited knowledge. My goal is to get to the point where I'm capable
&gt; of running Debian as my OS - though not necessarily in the next few
&gt; weeks!
&gt; 
&gt; Any help will be very much appreciated!
