Hi all,

I recently installed mandrake 9.1 (last tuesday) and I must say i'm very 
impressed with it overall.  However, on saturday I turned on my PC and 
instead of loading linux it first displayed the usual LILO graphical menu and 
after selecting the usual 'linux' option, it then went to the next graphical 
screen (as is default in mdk) and said:

kernel panic: unable to mount root fs on 03:02

or something pretty close to that.  Mandrake uses LILO by default and I have 
seen this message before with mandrake 7.2 or 8.0.  At this stage I was 
fairly new to linux and solved the problem by reinstalling and have not had 
the problem since.  For some time now I had been using suse 8.1 pro, which 
uses grub, and have not had any problems with it.

The only thing that had changed since the pc had last been shut down (about 1 
hour earlier) was that all cords/cables had been unplugged from the case.  I 
then went back to it and plugged everything back in and went to fire it up 
and got the above message.

Any ideas on what causes this?
Is it a problem with LILO or not related to LILO at all?

I solved the problem by reinstalling and choosing 'upgrade' - so it only took 
about 10 minutes, and allowed me to change the bootloader to grub, which 
worked.

So my system is now working again as before, but if anyone knows what causes 
this error and how to avoid it, please let me (and the list) know.

thanks.

-Steve.
