Hi eljumad,

On Tue, 2003-04-01 at 12:44, <A HREF="mailto:eljumad@internode.on.net">eljumad@internode.on.net</A> wrote:
&gt; Hi All,
&gt; A quick pick of your brains regarding possible causes please:
&gt; 
&gt; We have a p3 800 with 256MB Ram box running e-smith as server and gateway. Realtek
&gt; 8139 NICs.

Realtek NICS have a reputation for being flaky under heavy load. That
noted, we've personally had no problems with them at all (all 8139's).

&gt; Recently upgraded it from a dial-up connection to ADSL and added the second
&gt; NIC to do so. The client has complained that often the speed is very slow, even
&gt; worse than when we had them on the dial-up. This speed loss is inconsistent
&gt; though - client PCs accessing the intenet will often load webpages quickly and
&gt; download files rapidly at 26kb/s, but then at other times hardly be able to
&gt; load a web page properly.
&gt; 
&gt; My feeling is that it is the ADSL line or the modem, as they have already had
&gt; troubles with the line in the past (ISP tested it from their end and confirmed).
&gt; On the ADSL modem (DSL-300), the ethernet and ADSL connection lights flash furiously
&gt; all the time, instead of staying on consistently.

This is normal for the DSL-300. The flashing represents data flow, or
internet traffic.

&gt; 
&gt; I can ping out of this e-smith box, either internally to hosts on the LAN or
&gt; externally to the internet. Can also establish telnet connections to the box's
&gt; mail ports from an external location. The e-smith resolves names to IP addresses
&gt; fine.
&gt; 
&gt; Their box is also set up the same as one we have here and with the same version
&gt; of e-smith (5.1.2), and we don't have any problems (though their symptoms sound
&gt; like ours when the line is playing up).
&gt; 
&gt; My question is this: is there anything else that I can test in the e-smith to
&gt; eliminate it as a factor in the lack of speed?

Is data being uploaded from any of the PC's when the slow-down occurs ?

My feeling is that your uplink may be getting saturated & thus
destroying your downlink.
If they can't be sure whether data is being uploaded & no-one is
admitting to it (a la the file-sharing client), run some type of
netlogger for a few days & note the slow-down periods. You can then go
back & look over the logs matching these slow times.
Ntop is a nice html-based logger that runs it's own web-server to serve
the html logs created -&gt; <A HREF="http://www.ntop.org/overview.html">http://www.ntop.org/overview.html</A> but there's
many others.
If the upload traffic is found to be acceptable, the download problem
still exists & so you need to implement Quality of Service (QoS)
measures on the gateway.
Read here -&gt; <A HREF="http://lartc.org/">http://lartc.org/</A>
In a nutshell, it can throttle designated IP's/ports & give priority to
different kinds of traffic.

Hope this helps,
Regards,
Rick
