&gt; &gt;I'm going to make the charitable assumption that the reason you've
&gt; &gt;neglected the way that the Japanese occupied PNG, bombed Darwin, and
&gt; &gt;sent submarines into Sydney Harbor in World War II was because nobody
&gt; &gt;bothered to tell you, rather than because you've forgotten (which is,
&gt; &gt;after all, one of the things that Anzac Day is specifically intended
&gt; &gt;to avoid...)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Consider yourself educated.  You're welcome.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I am aware of the things that happened in W.W.II and as I said in an
&gt; earlier post it would be the most likely contender for a war in the
&gt; defense our freedom.
&gt;
&gt; But consider why and how we became involved in that war. Australian
&gt; troops first fired on the Japanese (and conducted themselves admirably
&gt; *) in the Malay campaign which ultimately lead to the fall of Singapore.
&gt;
&gt; Why Singapore? Because we were defending the bastion of the British
&gt; Empire, not freedom. The Pacific war was largely over Vietnam, the Malay
&gt; peninsula, and the resources contained within. Largely a colonial
&gt; territory of France, which Great Britain eagerly saw handed back to them
&gt; at the termination of hostilities in 1945. In fact after the war they
&gt; armed Japanese soldiers to crush the freedom seeking Vietnamese
&gt; resistance, which had been a help up until then in fighting the Japanese.
&gt;
&gt; The jews were liberated in Europe, but that was very much a byproduct
&gt; and not a goal of the war, Eastern Europe was occupied and controlled by
&gt; the Soviet Union, West Germany partitioned into French, English and
&gt; American zones. Africa was very much still controlled by Europe, no more
&gt; freedom won there.
&gt;
&gt; We managed to hang onto PNG by fighting a horrific war of attrition down
&gt; the Kokoda trail. The men who fought on that trail were nothing short of
&gt; amazing, as were the natives who supported them. So what ever did happen
&gt; to them? The  Dutch rulers returned to Indonesia with help, as with the
&gt; Portuguese  colonists to East Timor. Australia continued it's mandate of
&gt; PNG awarded in 1920.
&gt;
&gt; The second world war was a war of stagnated economies, third world
&gt; resources and empire, that it got close to a fight for our survival
&gt; shows how much the Japanese were  underestimated. It certainly didn't
&gt; start as a war for survival. The Japanese didn't simply wake up one
&gt; morning and decide to take out Broome.
&gt;
&gt; All the freedoms and rights we ever won we won them in peace, some in
&gt; 1901. More were handed down to us in common law. We've fought in 8 major
&gt; conflicts, and we've been threatened once.
&gt;
&gt; What does all this mean? Should we not have ANZAC day? We should
&gt; definitely have ANZAC day, we must remember those who fell, their mates
&gt; who returned and the families torn apart. But please don't start
&gt; thinking that our free nation was borne out of conflict and has only
&gt; survived through our continual participation in wars not of our making
&gt; nor of our benefit. And don't make the same mistake that W.W.II was a
&gt; war of liberation for all. After all, there were probably fewer free
&gt; countries after the war than before.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; *If you ever get a chance read "Staff Officer Walah" the diaries of a
&gt; digger in the Malay - Singapore campaign.
&gt;
&gt; If you are interested in continuing this debate perhaps we should take
&gt; it off-line...
