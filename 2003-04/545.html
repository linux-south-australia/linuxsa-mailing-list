You may be struggling to find people withut a life here but I'll give it a go.
Firstly
the site your are being directed to is a zonelarm ip. So asking the obvious
any references to Zone alaram on your system?

Secondly did you try and track down the references to the ip within your
system?
if file find containing text &lt;ip address? also for the name it resolves to.

Also do a regedit and do a find in there for the ip address or the name it
resolves to.

Thirdly 
It's been a while since I used these pc firewall thingies but you may have
a trojan of somesort and zonealarm is trapping it trying to get out and
directing your to a site about it. It may depend how tight you have the
security, Do you have warn me on every attempt setup?

Finally
The other thing is if your are running zonealarm then uninstall it. Get
tinyfirewall or something like that. ZA is good I guess but it may be
misbehaving.

Good luck

Evan

&gt;Yes, I know this is the Linux list and this problem is occurring on a

&gt;getting desperate to resolve this problem.
&gt;
&gt;Have I been owned?
&gt;
&gt;Doesn't matter if I am using IE 6, Opera 7 or Netscape 4, doesn't 
&gt;matter if I dial into CompuServe direct or come through my LAN to 
&gt;AirNet, any access to the web will end up at <A HREF="http://208.185.174.60,">http://208.185.174.60,</A> a 
&gt;site supposedly on Zone alarm's web site and advertising Linksys and 
&gt;PC-Cillan.
&gt;
&gt;No idea why. I have totalled ALL caches and cookies. There isn't any 
&gt;link within registry that I can find. Ad-Aware found a link in Opera 
&gt;but I removed that. AVG doesn't find anything BUT it cant get through 
&gt;to update the definitions.
&gt;
&gt;It looks and feels like I have been had but there aren't any *.hat 
&gt;files and none of the many *.js files come up with those numbers 
&gt;embeddd in them.
&gt;
&gt;Oh, and I have no problems with IM and Emails, only web sites.
&gt;
&gt;Earlier today I managed to follow a link to a web site, but as soon as 
&gt;I tried to get off that page to another that linksys page would load 
&gt;up. This has been 4 days now and I am really getting peeved!!!
&gt;
&gt;WTF is happening to my system?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,  Ian
