Personally, I've never quite understood the obsession with high uptimes.
I understand when people have needs that require high availability, or
lots of uptime, but, isn't the test for satisfying that usually a
percentage figure, rather than a number of days figure? -- ie, isn't it
more important to have (say) a 99.999% uptime (which is about 5 mins per
year) than to have 500+ days uptime -- which could be followed by a four
day rebuild, really...

&gt; Subject: uptime = 1 day, Grrrrr....
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For the last 500 days, I've been taking pleasure in the fact 
&gt; that my UPS protects me from the vagaries of the Adelaide 
&gt; electricity situation, and I've been watching my graph at 
&gt; Netcraft UK 
&gt; <A HREF="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph/?mode_u">http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph/?mode_u</A>=off&mode_w=on&site
&gt; =www.topology.org
&gt; steadily climbing towards the 500 day mark.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I know that they say in their uptime notes 
&gt; <A HREF="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/accuracy.html">http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/accuracy.html</A>#cycle
&gt; 
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------
&gt; The method that Netcraft uses to determine the uptime of i
&gt; a server is bounded by an upper limit of
&gt; 497 days for some Operating Systems (see above). It is 
&gt; therefore not possible to see uptimes for
&gt; these systems that go beyond this upper limit. Although 
&gt; we could in theory attempt to compute the
&gt; true uptime for OS's with this upper limit by monitoring 
&gt; for restarts at the expected time, we prefer
&gt; not to do this as it can be inaccurate and error prone. 
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; ...but I understood this to mean that Netcraft's sneeky 
&gt; method of finding out my server's uptime was deficient in 
&gt; some way. (By the way, how _do_ they find out the uptime via 
&gt; TCP/IP? It must be by TCP/IP port 80 because the server does 
&gt; no ICMP or UDP etc., and all ports apart from 80 are 
&gt; non-existent to the outside world.)
&gt; 
&gt; Somehow this note of theirs just didn't quite sink in:
&gt; 
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------
&gt; Additionally HP-UX, Linux, Solaris and recent releases of 
&gt; FreeBSD cycle back to zero after 497
&gt; days, exactly as if the machine had been rebooted at that 
&gt; precise point. Thus it is not possible to see a
&gt; HP-UX, Linux or Solaris system with an uptime measurement 
&gt; above 497 days. 
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; I still thought it meant that the remote method of 
&gt; determining uptime was lacking in some way, not the OS itself.
&gt; 
&gt; But now I check my uptime expecting to have gone over 500 
&gt; days, and find this:
&gt; 
&gt;   2:38pm  up 1 day, 13:11, 32 users,  load average: 0.06, 
&gt; 0.03, 0.01        
&gt; 
&gt; Grrrr and double-Grrrr!
&gt; 
&gt; What is the point of a UPS if linux is just going to reset 
&gt; the uptime after 497 days? Who's bright idea was it to make 
&gt; it impossible to boast a 500+ day uptime? Now what's the 
&gt; point in me avoiding re-boots until the 2-year mark? It will 
&gt; just show 233 days or something. Who's going to believe me 
&gt; that 233 days is really 730 days?
&gt; 
&gt; So now people who look at my Netcraft UK graph will think I 
&gt; re-booted after 497 days - just missing the 500. This is not 
&gt; good for the reputation of linux stability!! In this life, it 
&gt; is not enough to _be_ good. You have to be able to prove it!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, and Grrrr again,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt; 
&gt; PS. Obviously now is a good time to rip in some more cheap 
&gt; RAM and a new kernel. This finally answers for me the question: 
&gt; "How long should a linux system go between software and 
&gt; hardware upgrades."
&gt; Answer: 497 days.
