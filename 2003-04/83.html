&gt; &gt; &gt; Its funny you should mention that, MS is releasing updayted versions
of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the xbox to close loopholes that enabled mod'ers to add modified
bois's
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, why shouldn't they?  Like Sony and Nintendo, MS sell hardware that
is
&gt; &gt; heavily subsidised by subsequent software sales.  Like Sony and
Nintendo, MS
&gt; &gt; is hostile to people undermining it's business model.  I don't like it
&gt; &gt; either but understand MS's position as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If MS let unlicensed software slide by they are undermining their
ability to
&gt; &gt; force game makers to pay royalties to have rights to publish for the
XBox.
&gt; &gt; Nintendo and Sony do the same.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PCs are a different matter though, and I am wholly opposed to any
&gt; &gt; restrictions there.
&gt;
&gt; An XBox is really very similar to a PC. It is a piece of hardware that
&gt; runs software. Why do you think there should be any difference ethically
&gt; in what you are allowed to run on it?

Sony, Nintendo and MS all allow only licensed software to be run on their
consoles.
While the XBox is a cut down PC, it is being sold as a games machine and
should (IMHO) be treated as such.  The same stick that's applied to
Microsoft should be shaken at Sony and Nintendo too, as they have an
identical business model albeit based on non PC hardware.  MS don't sell the
XBox to do accounting, word processing, programming or graphic design.
Maybe the XBox is just the first step to MS introducing a 'crippled PC' that
lets you do everything a normal PC does but only using MS software?
unknown...

&gt; And on the subsidisation issue, do you think the price of Windows would
&gt; be so affordable[1] if they didn't plan on being able to make most of
&gt; their money with Office and server products such as Exchange and MS SQL?

According to recently linked articles on /. it's the other way around,
Windows and Office subsidise everything else at Microsoft.

&gt; Yet we're not forced to use these (although they do try).
&gt;
&gt; I wonder how many anti-trust lawsuits would pop up if Microsoft were to
&gt; say "you are only allowed to use Microsoft software in Windows".

There would be many (and deservedly so).
