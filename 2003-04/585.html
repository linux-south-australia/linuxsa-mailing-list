The style of denial is very similar ;-)

&gt; Bet ya im older (may be not) but I too remember laugh in - but they were
&gt; repeats.

I turn 51 this year and the episodes I watched were originals.

&gt; BTW: Is lycoris any good? Compared to RH?
&gt; or is it much of a muchness?

I wouldn't compare them like that. More like horses for courses
(appropriate phrase as this is Oakbank Weekend) ;-) 

Lycoris is very deliberately aimed at the newbie or else the newbie with
some Windows exposure. It even opens with a background of a rolling green
hillside with patchy clouds - deja vu for XP users. The icons, the Control
Panel, the terminology, all chosen to provide a familiar Windows-esque
environment to the user. On start-up you even have a very nifty swf show
taking you through all the main icons and setup options.

It is also very deliberately cut back to desktop functions and user
environment. For starters you cant compile unless you download gcc and the
rest with the Development Tools CD. Many of the networking tools that you
might expect are simply not included, same with a few of the handy
troubleshooting tools that you might otherwise expect.

It has some great features built in to make it tempting to the enterprise
user. It has Remote Assistance and Desktop Sharing built into the menus. It
has good access to web cams and other home user tools. 

It is a PITA to load if it is expecting a network and there isn't one. It
puts things in different places as it is based on Caldera OpenLinux, RPMs
from Manduck or RedBeanie just don't work right.

It still only comes with KDE 2.2 though 3.x is in the wings and should be
ready in a few betas. Current beta has just notched up to 75, STABLE is 46.

In short, I really do like it for the market niche that I want to use it
for. With fine tuning we can resolve most of the things that seem to slow
it up and the Windows-esque interface is a benefit not a downfall FOR THIS
NICHE.

It is not Red Hat, nor Mandrake nor SuSE etc. It doesn't pretend to be. It
knows where it is headed and I think it has a very good chance of being a
success in that niche.

I should add that it has a very strong Community at <A HREF="http://www.lycoris.org">http://www.lycoris.org</A>
and pretty well any sort of problem can be answered and in a friendly
manner.

Oh, and the CSDN has the download CD available (at present beta 69) if
anybody wants to try it out.


Cheers,  Ian
