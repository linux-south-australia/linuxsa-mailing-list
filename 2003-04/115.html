Hey,

I have installed Mandrake 9.1 on my friends computer which has the following 
specs:

nforce 2 motherboard and chipset
AMD XP 2100+
LITEON burner
NVIDIA Geforce 3
I think the board has firewire, USB 2.0, some intel audio (haven't got the PC 
in front of me so I can't get exact information). I have installed the binary 
only nvnet and nvidia geforce drivers (4191, will soon upgrade to latest).

Anyway, Mandrake 9.1 is behaving rather strangely on this computer, problems 
i've seen are:

1) Kernel panicked whilst reading a CD and attempting to play lbreakout2 
(scroll lock and caps lock lights were flashing and computer stopped 
responding)

2) Just now, attempted to do a burn, whilst the burn was happening I attempted 
to load chromium (which would not load) and frozen-bubble (which wouldnt load 
either).

chromium and frozen bubble were in the process list, but I could not kill 
chromium (I didn't try killing frozen-bubble).

Once the burn completed, frozen bubble loaded sprang to life as though it had 
been sitting there waiting.

It seems that there is a conflict with going to fullscreen mode and using the 
burner. The process requesting full screen mode just sits there and waits. I 
could play cannon smash at the same time with no probs (I wasn't in 
fullscreen mode).

Also, the burn failed at the very end (the part where it closes the session i 
think), k3b reported unknown error and the disk was unreadable.

Any ideas what on earth is going on? Mandrake 9.1 works fine on my computer 
(KT266 MB, Athlon T-Bird 1.4, etc)

Thanks!

Damien
