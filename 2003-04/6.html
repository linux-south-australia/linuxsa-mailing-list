Hi All,
A quick pick of your brains regarding possible causes please:

We have a p3 800 with 256MB Ram box running e-smith as server and gateway. Realtek
8139 NICs.
Recently upgraded it from a dial-up connection to ADSL and added the second
NIC to do so. The client has complained that often the speed is very slow, even
worse than when we had them on the dial-up. This speed loss is inconsistent
though - client PCs accessing the intenet will often load webpages quickly and
download files rapidly at 26kb/s, but then at other times hardly be able to
load a web page properly.

My feeling is that it is the ADSL line or the modem, as they have already had
troubles with the line in the past (ISP tested it from their end and confirmed).
On the ADSL modem (DSL-300), the ethernet and ADSL connection lights flash furiously
all the time, instead of staying on consistently.

I can ping out of this e-smith box, either internally to hosts on the LAN or
externally to the internet. Can also establish telnet connections to the box's
mail ports from an external location. The e-smith resolves names to IP addresses
fine.

Their box is also set up the same as one we have here and with the same version
of e-smith (5.1.2), and we don't have any problems (though their symptoms sound
like ours when the line is playing up).

My question is this: is there anything else that I can test in the e-smith to
eliminate it as a factor in the lack of speed?
The ISP help desk has suggested that the client unplug their PCs from the network
and then plug them in one at a time to check if there is a PC causing the fault.


Cheers
Julian
