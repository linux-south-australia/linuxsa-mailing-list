&gt; Michael,

&gt; Thanks tons for that. It was driving me mad.
&gt; After trying for a long time to find the cause of this "feature",
&gt; I later removed the Klipper applet because I couldn't work out what it did,
&gt; and I need a bit more RAM - basically because KDE uses up about 90 MBytes
&gt; of RAM by loading stuff in the "X" process and is really very RAM-hungry all round.
&gt; Now I use xterm instead of Konsole because xterm uses very significantly less RAM,
&gt; and I use about 45 text terminals at any one time for development.
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, another annoying thing about KDE is that whenever the RAM runs out,
&gt; which is like about once a day, the Kicker process crashes and I lose the task bar thing.
&gt; It took ages to work out that "Kicker" was the name of the task bar so that I could restart it.
&gt; I must say that KDE has taken some very unfortunate turns in the last couple 
&gt; of years. They're making it more and more uncontrollable and incomprehensible - one of
&gt; the reasons I hate MS-windholes. (The word Window is actually a contraction of Wind-Hole.)

Klipper is pretty well as annoying and useful as that sodding paperclip 
on office...we disable for recipients at computerbank, as we have low 
end machines, ad it DOES make a difference (hell, one of our advisors on 
that is a vol in vic who happens to be a kde developer, and he hates it 
too:)  )

&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, that's one more annoyance gone.
&gt; Now I just have to work out how I'm going to memorize all these 
&gt; meaningless program names: Kicker, Klipper, Konsole, ....  
&gt; Bring back the dictionary, I say. Where were these people educated?!

they think its kute;)
