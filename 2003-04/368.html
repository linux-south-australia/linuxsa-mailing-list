David,

&gt; If there were one platform then our effort at making it 
&gt; secure and robust would be a lot more effective.  Right now 

There is effectively one platform for desktop computing, and our effort
at making it secure and robust has been remarkably inneffective.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; cures most ills.  Should someone find a way to kill the one 
&gt; platform, a solution will quickly be found: then re-load, 
&gt; apply the patch, and re-enable network access; et voilla.

Welcome to Utopia, population one.

&gt; 
&gt; The fact is that we did leave it computing to diversity, and 
&gt; the best that Apple, CDC, Cray, Digital, HP, IBM, NCR, NCR, 
&gt; Nixdorf, Sun, Tandem Unisys, and a cast of thousands of 
&gt; others could do was to create an environment that was 
&gt; hoplessly expensive, quite lacking in inter-operability, 
&gt; locked the opposition out of "their own" customers, and 
&gt; generally kept computing in the dark ages.  I claim that 
&gt; Microsoft and Intel, by giving us a common platform, have 
&gt; done more to drive down the price and beef up the features of 
&gt; computing than any other organisation before.  So it's not 
&gt; perfect. Name one platform that is.

I think you may just have refuted your own argument -- you can't name
one platform that is perfect. Each platform has its' own strengths and
weaknesses, and the diversity is a Good Thing. To rephrase your own
words, one could easily say that:

---
... the best that Microsoft and Intel and a cast of two or three others
could do was to create an environment that was insecure and unstable,
quite lacking in inter-operability, locked the opposition out of "their
own" customers, and generally kept computing in the dark ages.
---

Yes, there would be advantages in homegenity (sp?), and in the ideal
world, our IT infrastructure may well be homogenous, but in the
meantime, we have to deal with the imperfections that the real world
introduces, and that means that diversity is an asset worth fighting
for.
