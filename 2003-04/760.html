&gt;&gt; &gt;  Innovation is not something that is easy to do in the kind of

&gt;&gt; &gt; us  than they have seen from that community.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; And he seriously expects the readers to believe that? He should be
&gt; helping  Bush write his speeches &lt;sigh&gt;

And 'our' customers are Windows die-hards? Of course they have seen more
innovation from MS, as 'puppet' customers, they haven't seen anything
else.
This statement is perfectly reasonable, taken in context. Other systems'
customers may have seen something different in the innovation area.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Linux itself is a clone of an operating system that is 20-plus years
&gt;&gt; old. That's what it is. That is what you can get today, a clone of a
&gt;&gt; 20-year-old system. I'm not saying that it doesn't have some place for
&gt;&gt;  some customers, but that is not an innovative proposition.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; And just what difference is that meant to make?  Just when did Windows
&gt; first come out of hiding?

This is a feature, not a bug. I don't want any 'new' OS on my HD. I want
something that has been shaped by bug reports and feature demands by it's
users and developers. Anything less than 5 years is probably crap.
We are not talking about the latest game, or graphical utility, we are
talking about the core of the systems. we want reliable and flexible over
new and cool.
&gt;
&gt; What a load of FUD.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ... On the server side, you have people who have skill sets
&gt;&gt; and applications on Sun that they want to move now to Intel hardware
&gt;&gt; to save costs.
&gt;
&gt; Really, that is the main reason why Linux is leading the server market
&gt; still?

That's just marketing-droid speak for 'We think we can win some business
from Sun, let's spread some FUD in their direction'. Not worthy of a
response.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  A Linux PC in most countries is a PC in which somebody is being
&gt;&gt; encouraged to pirate Windows.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; ComputerBank better watch out, they will be accused of supporting
&gt; piracy  next simply because they release computers without Windows on
&gt; them. &lt;G&gt;
&gt;

Oh, yea. just like more terrorists support linux. Seen the latest
anti-piracy stuff at the end of some DVD's? It's Macarthyism all over
again.
PheaR our ParanoiA! (this is more scary than funny)

Regards.

Michael
