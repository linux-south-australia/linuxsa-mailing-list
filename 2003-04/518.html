&gt; I commonly have 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16-32.0.0/16 and 192.168.0-255/24 NATted 
&gt; so users on these private subnets can use the web and so on without 
&gt; needing routable IP addresses. I do this because I don't have the 
&gt; routable IPs spare to give them, and because it acts as an effective 
&gt; firewall -- people can't directly reach them from the internet. You 
&gt; appear to be saying that doing this is counter-productive... Why? How? 
&gt; Huh? Have I just misinterpreted something fundamental here, or have I 
&gt; been counter-productive for the past few years? :)

You can use any of the private address spaces for either
NAT or unrouted networks.

For gear like printers and the administrative ports of
network boxes you don't even want people inside the
organisation getting unauthenticated IP-layer access.
Nothing good can come of it.

As an aside, you might notice that there isn't much
difference between an application-layer firewall and
the print spooler example.

My comment that "NATing a non-routed subnet was counter-
productive" wasn't refering to the address space, but
to the use of that space.  If you've gone to the trouble
of putting printers onto a subnet distinct from Joe User,
you don't want to make that subnet visible to the Internet.

There's a big argument about the pros and cons of NAT.  But
this isn't anything to do with that.
