Yes, I know this is the Linux list and this problem is occurring on a 
Win 98 system but I trust you guys to have the answers and I am truly 
getting desperate to resolve this problem.

Have I been owned?

Doesn't matter if I am using IE 6, Opera 7 or Netscape 4, doesn't 
matter if I dial into CompuServe direct or come through my LAN to 
AirNet, any access to the web will end up at <A HREF="http://208.185.174.60,">http://208.185.174.60,</A> a 
site supposedly on Zone alarm's web site and advertising Linksys and 
PC-Cillan.

No idea why. I have totalled ALL caches and cookies. There isn't any 
link within registry that I can find. Ad-Aware found a link in Opera 
but I removed that. AVG doesn't find anything BUT it cant get through 
to update the definitions.

It looks and feels like I have been had but there aren't any *.hat 
files and none of the many *.js files come up with those numbers 
embeddd in them.

Oh, and I have no problems with IM and Emails, only web sites.

Earlier today I managed to follow a link to a web site, but as soon as 
I tried to get off that page to another that linksys page would load 
up. This has been 4 days now and I am really getting peeved!!!

WTF is happening to my system?

Cheers,  Ian
