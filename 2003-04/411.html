&gt; Hi

&gt; Computer cases unless they are of the more expensive sturdy variety
&gt; don't always like being moved and can make a drive cable loose enough
&gt; not to work. That doesn't mean it has to be off not to work either.

this is what i first thought.  i tried reseating all cards, memory etc and 
also reconnecting the drives in case a cable had been dislodged or whatever.  
Still the same response.  I tried creating a bootable floppy using mdk's 
windoze tools but the floppy booted with the same result...

i once had it display a slightly different error ('unable to mount root fs on 
09:06'    - instead of 03:02) but i'm not sure what that means.  I remember 
reading up on what the numbers meant but i've forgotten now...

&gt;
&gt; Lilo expects partitions to remain in their place ie /boot / /etc etc.
&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong someone but doesn't the kernel load from the
&gt; boot sector then it goes looking for partitions part way through
&gt; loading. If a hard drive isn't there that was before something vital
&gt; could be missing. Are all your Linux partitions on the one drive?
&gt;

yes.  its a 20GB seagate barracuda II (7200rpm) set as master (on the onboard 
ATA133 controller - ASUS A7V133 M/B with IDE RAID but i'm not using the RAID 
slots) and a Fujitsu 7200rpm 8.4GB drive set as slave.

The seagate is my linux drive:
250MB swap
6GB / (reiserfs)
3GB /home (reiserfs)
9.7GB (reiserfs) = my own data storage area...

The fujitsu is my windoze drive, very rarely used.

The system would boot to the slave drive, which contained XOSL (to allow 
dual-boot - since the linux bootloader wont start windows because windows is 
on the slave drive - i blame windows for this, not lilo/grub).
It would then go to the linux bootloader and continue from there...(if linux 
was selected on XOSL).

i tried it without the windows drive connected, so that the only bootloader 
was lilo, but still the same problem.


&gt; If you could get that graphical screen off then you could see how far
&gt; through loading that your machine got.
&gt;

the error was where instead of saying 'init version 2.84' (i think that's the 
version no.) it would say 'kernel panic...etc. etc'.  So obviously its right 
before the 'init' program was started.  I did try a non-fb bootup to get 
this...

&gt; If lilo.conf had been changed by any of the Mandrake graphical tools did
&gt; that tool finish off properly by running lilo again after the changes?
&gt;

or some automatic script run on shutdown?


thanks everyone for all the help!

My system is working again, I'm just clueless as to what caused the problem 
and I have the feeling that lilo is just too sensitive and fragile.  I first 
tried to reinstall lilo by reinstalling and choosing the 'update' option.  
This basically skips package installation and goes through post-install 
again.  This didn't work so i tried again and selected grub and this fixed 
everything.

Another bonus for grub is that you can actually edit your grub config entirely 
without booting linux at all!  I dont think this is possible with lilo, since 
lilo needs to be re-run from within linux to save the config.

cheers,

-Steve
