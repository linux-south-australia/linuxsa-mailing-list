Hmm..sounds like you've already made up your mind as to what it is, so
why ask ?

Re-assurance & agreeance from other parties perhaps ?

Anyway, you could try 'renice' & 'nice' to give your burning process
lower cpu priority & your program that is queuing a higher priority.
The queued program will open but just stand back while those toasted
coasters fly.

Btw, having a shit hot CPU doesn't mean jack if the motherboard handles
the data poorly. The same CPU on different motherboards will behave very
differently.

Having said that, it may also be a misconfiguration in the kernel that
could be causing a performance hit. Note that the nForce2's IDE
controller on linux, works in compatibility mode by default (no DMA) but
needs a kernel patch for nearly full performance. This will give you one
massive performance boost. Check your current HD speeds with a
'hdparm -Tt /dev/hd(X)' - X being your hard drive letter.

Then apply the nforce2 patch available here -&gt;
<A HREF="http://home.t-online.de/home/Johannes.Deisenhofer/nforce2ide.diff">http://home.t-online.de/home/Johannes.Deisenhofer/nforce2ide.diff</A>

Re-compile your kernel, boot into it & then compare the previous speeds
with another 'hdparm -Tt /dev/hd(X)'

Currently the patch will only take you up to UDMA-100. The chipset
supports up to UDMA-133, and this is being worked on apparently.

Good luck,
Regards,
Rick

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am using ALSA, I don't think NVIDIA supply an audio driver for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; nforce2. This machine is running a whole bunch of binary drivers: Lucent
&gt; &gt; &gt; Winmodem, Nvidia Network Card, and Nvidia Geforce 3 card.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Btw I just tried unloading the nvnet driver and it makes no difference
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the burning problem. Haven't gotten another kernel panic yet though.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I can reproduce the burning problem consistently:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Start burning something in k3b, e.g. an iso
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Attempt to start any fullscreen game, e.g. frozen-bubble
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; At this point the game will not start, although it will be in the process
&gt; &gt; &gt; list. If you attempt to kill said process it will not die, however the
&gt; &gt; &gt; request to kill seems to be queued and the program ends up dying once the
&gt; &gt; &gt; burning is finished.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) wait til burning finishes, or cancel the burning
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; At the very instant the burning stops, frozen-bubble will come up.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the strangest problem I have ever seen. How on earth is burning
&gt; &gt; &gt; and switching to fullscreen mode related?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is quite normal & is not specific to switching to fullscreen.
&gt; &gt; Rather, the CD burning process takes precedence over all other CPU
&gt; &gt; intense activities. Hence the queuing.
&gt; &gt; This is needed to ensure the fifo buffer is kept topped up with data
&gt; &gt; while the burning process is happening, & so ensure (to a certain
&gt; &gt; extent) that you won't have a failed burn.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt; Rick
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; This is an athlon XP 2100+. I could play quake 3 arena and the buffer would 
&gt; still remain full. I do not have such problems on my home computer (1.4 
&gt; Athlon), however I installed Mandrake 9.0 initially and upgraded to 9.1. The 
&gt; computer with the burning problem was installed with mdk 9.1 only.
&gt; 
&gt; How can I disable this "feature"? I am still not convinced this is a feature. 
&gt; As cannon-smash loaded and was playable with no problems (high frame rate 
&gt; too). Open office loaded and was fine (surely launching that beast uses some 
&gt; CPU). On my home computer with mdk 9.1 I can do jus
