&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey y'all,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Does anyone know of any Linux/*nix work in Iraq? Serious question. They
&gt; &gt;&gt; will have lost most of their comms infrastructure, and must be needing
&gt; &gt;&gt; help rebuilding. Seeing as .au was involved in the destruction, and we
&gt; &gt;&gt; are expecting to be involved in reconstruction in some way, I'd like to
&gt; &gt;&gt; do my bit (particularly if they pay well, which I suspect they will --
&gt; &gt;&gt; all the oil they won in the battle must be worth something, right? ;)
&gt; &gt;&gt; ...
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyone know of any companies who are likely to get involved, and who
&gt; &gt;&gt; might be looking for talent? (I have talent, really I do...)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Have you considered the danger.
&gt;
&gt;I have, in the past.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; With a large number of discarded AK-47s and a number of unhappy
&gt; &gt; pro-Saddam people wandering about, any random westerner stands a
&gt; &gt; much higher change of being shot, I reckon.
&gt;
&gt;Sure.  But it's still minimal.  Look how few people got killed during
&gt;hostilities.  I suspect the biggest danger would be getting run over.

or being shot by americans, they killed more westerners in the last two 
weeks than iraqi soldiers did...........
