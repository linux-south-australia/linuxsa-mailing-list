&gt; Hey again....
&gt; 
&gt; I always bought my distros from there for like $10 when they came out,
&gt; because they were always advertised straight away, and arrived within days.
&gt; 
&gt; I do like owning originals of software, at least with linux, its affordable,
&gt; whereas even Windows 98 is still $200 in some stores. Why support a company
&gt; like microsoft, i will never know, when it is easier, simpler and more
&gt; beneficial to support companies like Red Hat or Mandrake. I will take your
&gt; suggestions into account.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, are there contact details for ComputerBank.. My grandmother saw it on
&gt; channel 7 the other day, and suggested i might like to get involved. I
&gt; would, and would like to contact them.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to u all...

&gt; &gt; Michael,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't take this as picking on you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; People on LinuxSA wouldn't be hypersensitive, pedantic, sarcastic or
&gt; &gt; neurotic would they?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mandrake is on the brink of bankruptcy.  Buy an official Mandrake
&gt; &gt; &gt; version and support the company that puts the distro together and
&gt; &gt; &gt; funds the development of the software that goes in.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I really think that the business model of selling distributions when you
&gt; &gt; can download them for free (from Internode or Telstra for example) is
&gt; &gt; bunk. It doesn't make business sense, it's not likely to be profitable
&gt; &gt; and there aren't enough people who take your stance to make it
&gt; &gt; profitable.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Besides which, organisations such as ComputerBank and the CSDN-SA also
&gt; &gt; target clients or recipients who can't even afford to spend $2/CD
&gt; &gt; because that means there's no food for the children and so forth.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Everything Linux (<A HREF="http://www.everythinglinux.com.au">http://www.everythinglinux.com.au</A>) and Linux Systems
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lab (<A HREF="http://www.lsl.com.au">http://www.lsl.com.au</A>) here in Australia both sell official
&gt; &gt; &gt; versions of both Red Hat and Mandrake.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyone is welcome to donate money to the vendors either directly or
&gt; &gt; through the CSDN-SA; I'm sure the branch coordinator of ComputerBank
&gt; &gt; wouldn't mind accepting and forwarding appropriate donations to Mandrake
&gt; &gt; or RedHat.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
