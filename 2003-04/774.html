Assuming ofcourse you haven't deleted the spool file with userdel -r (I too 
haven't seen the option -d)

Wouldn't it be much easier commandline?

As root (as you can't really logon as a deleted user)

cat /var/spool/mail/[deleted_usesname] &gt;&gt; /[path/to/new/file]

this copies the spool file to another file the &gt;&gt; appends (&gt; overwrites) then 
if you want to read it, in Mutt pressing c lets you change to where you put 
the file.

Ofcourse if the spool file is gone, you'll need to get it from backup... and 
if you don't have a backup... Now would be a good time to start keeping them 
:)

&gt; &gt;I now need the mail spool file for this user (i.e.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is there anyway of restoring this from the command line.

&gt; &gt;I am using RH 7.2.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Martin. :-)
&gt;
&gt; If you log in as root, change the name of the file to a different user
&gt; name, and give that user name permissions to read the file it will work.
&gt;
&gt; A lot of the time I will use the GUI for this, logged in as root.
&gt;
&gt; Below, you will run ls -l to determine if a mail file exists for that
&gt; user name.  Don't rename the old file to the new user name there,
&gt; otherwise the new file will overwrite the old file, deleting the old mail.
&gt;
&gt; To remedy this, you can pull the mail out of /var/spool/mail temporarily
&gt; with Netscape's Movemail. In Netscape 4.7, change your default mail
&gt; server from pop3 to movemail with the GUI.  In Netscape 7x, you have to
&gt; edit $HOME/.mozilla/default/
&gt; uniqueid/prefs.js to change the word "pop3" to "movemail".
&gt;
&gt; WHen you check your mail, Movemail will moves it from
&gt; /var/spool/mail/name and combine it with
&gt; $HOME/.mozilla/default/uniqueid/mail/name of popserver/inbox.  If you
&gt; wanted to combine additional mail files in /var/spool/mail/ into one
&gt; file, you could rename additional mail files to the name of the user you
&gt; just setup Movemail for, and then move that file with Movemail again,
&gt; which will combine the two files into one, again in
&gt; $HOME/.mozilla/default/uniqueid/mail/name of popserver/inbox.
&gt;
&gt; You then can rename $HOME/.mozilla/default/uniqueid/mail/name of
&gt; popserver/inbox. to a user name and copy it to /var/spool/mail/username
&gt; and give that person rights to read the file, and you are finished.
&gt;
&gt; However, from the command line:
&gt;
&gt; cd /var/spool/mail
&gt;
&gt; ls -l
&gt;
&gt; mv /var/spool/mail/deletedguy /var/spool/mail/newuser
