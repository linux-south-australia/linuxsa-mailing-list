We have a multi-site network connected together using FreeS/WAN with one
SAMBA server at the head office - all the machines have the SAMBA server
as their WINS server.

It all works very well.

Broadcast is only used for discovery on the same subnet so its not
relavent here.

Make sure that all your client machines have the IP of the SAMBA server
as their WINS server.

We just did this via DHCP.

Subject: Samba/Win2K - browse lists over different subnets


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hiya,

I've done a bunch of wireless installs - each segment of the network 
(i.e. the network behind the "router", being the AP/client) has its own 
subnet, say 10.10.20/24, 10.10.30/24, etc.  Everything's trunked over 
pptp vpn's, not using NAT (real routing).  All is working beautifully, 
routing's great in the regard that everybody can talk to each other.  
"Routers" are a mix of Debian machines running pptpd/pptpd-client, or 
Windows 2K Server's.

Thing is, for obvious reasons (broadcast packets don't work over 
vpn's/different subnet's) each Windows machine can't see Windows 
machine's on the other subnet's.  If I type in the IP manually, say 
\\10.10.20.51, I can go to that machine no problems.

I'd like to be able to collate browse lists between subnets - I thought 
this would be possible by setting up a wins server, and running samba 
as a local domain master on each network "gateway" pointed towards the 
wins server, but alas, it doesn't appear to work.  The wins 
server/"master network" (where all the pptp-client's are connecting to) 
is a Windows 2000 Server, acting as a PDC, so I'm not sure if I perhaps 
didn't set something up there properly either.

Documentation doesn't seem to tell me how to do this terribly clearly, 
either.

Anybody done this, or can point me in the right direction?

R
