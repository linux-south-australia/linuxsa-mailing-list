Locking is a very complex issue. It's made even more complex when you
talk about a group of Windows machines (with their own locking
mechanisms), talking over SMB/CIFS (with it's locking mechanisms) being
translated (by Samba) into the locking mechanisms being used by the
operating system you're using (Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, etc). Luckily,
the Samba team have spent rather a long time making this stuff work
good. :-)

The best thing that I can suggest is to look at the documentation.
There's a little bit of locking info in the HOWTO collection and/or the
Using Samba book, both of which come with Samba and probably live under
/usr/share/doc/samba-2.2.7. I also thought that there was a LOCKING.txt
somewhere too, but I can't find it on my RedHat system.

At very least, look at the smb.conf(5) man page and look at all of the
locking related options and try to understand what each one does.

Just a quick note on oplocks, though. Oplocks are not so much to do with
file locking as we're used to seeing, but more to do with network
caching of files.


If you can give some specific information about the symptoms you're
seeing, I'm sure that people on this list will try to help you solve the
problem you're having.

thx,
Matt
