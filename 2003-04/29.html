<H1>WinME on hdb1 and GRUB</H1>

On two of my computers I have a problem when attempting this. First off, my
HDDs are set up as follows:

hda1 NTFS Win2000
hda5 FAT storage area
hdb1 fat WinME
hdc1 ext3 gentoo linux
hdc5 fat more storage

I've got the map (hd0) (hd1) and map (hd1) (hd0) lines in grub.conf, so
WinME at least boots. However, it shows 4 HDD partitions. c: is what I
expect (contents of hdb1). d: is an "unformatted" partition (at least, WinME
won't give me any data from that drive and wants to format whenever I access
it) with no label with the exact same size as hda5. e: has the contents (and
label) that I expect from hdc5 and f: has what I expect from hda5.

The problem here is what is f: should be d:, and d: shouldn't be there at
all. I'm not sure if it's a coincidence that d: is the exact size that I
expect it to be. doing an "fdisk /status" from a dos prompt shows me exactly
what it should be, not what windows explorer shows (there is no f: drive and
the d: drive is the exact size of hda5). I previously had Mandrake 9.0
installed on the system and when I tried grub, it had the same problem. I
also had the same problem on my old machine (which was partitioned exactly
the same).

I can't remember if I tried making grub boot from a floppy and swap map the
drives on my old computer, but now it only has 1 HDD, so I can no longer try
on that machine. My new machine doesn't have a floppy drive, so it's not
practicle for me to try this to see what drives a DOS boot disk would see.

When I use LILO and the map-drive commands, it works perfectly (WinME sees
the drives as it should - and this is also what I used when installing
WinME).

I thought it may be the ide controllers, but since the two computers are
based on different chipsets (I'm assuming they have different ide
controllers), I'm not convinced that's the case. My current computer has a
Asus A7N8X Deluxe (with the SATA disabled - based on the nVidia nForce2
chipset) and my old computer has a Asus P3V4X (based on Via Apollo Pro
chipset, I think - it's been a long time since I got it or thought about
it).

I did a bit of googling, but I couldn't find anything like what I'm seeing.
Does anyone know what else I can try? Despite this problem, I like grub more
than lilo and would like to use it if possible.

thanks,
Andy
