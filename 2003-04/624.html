You could try the dialisdn script from Traverse. Also their site may have some 
useful information.

&gt; Hello people this is going to sound funny, but just make out that I am a
&gt; newbie.
&gt; Currently I have an IPCOP box with the card in it and a network card
&gt; running (was) fine one the two ISP's I use.
&gt; During the easter weekend my normal isp decided to do a lot of work on the
&gt; ISP, so I was forced to use airnet which allows DoV (data over voice) to a
&gt; standard dial up, there connection is a 64K connection on isdn every time,
&gt; how ever my other isp uses 56k isdn, on the ipcop box I have the patch for
&gt; 56k and it use to work fine, So during this time lots of people where
&gt; letting me that I should be using a straight redhat 9 box, the old saying
&gt; you build it they will come, well they all left the ship.
&gt; So I tryied my harest to get this card to dial in to the two isp's first
&gt; started with airnet due to not needing to patch the kernal for 56k, So I
&gt; entered the phone number and pasword and username in the network setup
&gt; area, then savied all the setting, to force the card to do DoV a v is
&gt; placed in front of the number.
&gt; Well to my suprise on the reboot every thing lookied like it was work hisax
&gt; drivers and so one, the isdn box (telstras) would start to sync then the
&gt; line would drop, a quick look at message file for the card and suprise to
&gt; me if it is now dialing over seas, it added it +44and some over numbers
&gt; then my isps dial up number.
&gt; Well after some time for the life of me i could not work it out.
&gt; Has anybody got any idea how to get this card from www.traverse.com.au know
&gt; as a NetJet card working under redhat and more important the 56K DoV mode
&gt; ( I dont want to fund the telstra retirement fund at $1.10 per hour).
&gt; Because this is what happens if it is not in DoV mode.
&gt;
&gt; Happy Easter
