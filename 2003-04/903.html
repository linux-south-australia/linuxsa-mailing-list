&gt; &gt;&gt;Lehey exhibits all the worst things I have heardabout the BSD culture: he's
&gt; &gt;&gt;snobby and argumentative and can't stop promoting himself (see the plugs
&gt; &gt;&gt;for his books). But the other guy, Warner, seems to have his head on
&gt; &gt;&gt;straight and really know what he's talking about. I say promote the latter
&gt; &gt;&gt;and give the former the boot.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem with being really good at what you do is that others often
&gt; mistake superiority for attitude.  It's mostly dweebs who make that mistake!

i have used FreeBSD for about six years, for its tecnical merrits.
i've done support for may folks with FreeBSD, used it in large scale
hosting, and it was my primary desktop environment for a couple of
years.

but over the last ten years of using linux, and asking many folks fer help,
i have rarely, if ever had the kind of abuse from FreeBSD folks.
especially those folks that are 'core' and related individuals.
it is a shame that even only a few eletist whankers can spoil the bigger picture,
and its fair to say that i have met and worked with a lot of good people in
the FreeBSD community also in AU and the UK.

and balance is always the issue. just a shame i got burnt. to a crisp. often.

cheers,

Kim
