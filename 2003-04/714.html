Michael's Minute: No More White Box Blues

55% of computers sold worldwide are not sold by the major computer 
corporations that you see ads for on TV, but by thousands of small 
companies. Chances are there are dozens of such "white box" companies 
in your home town and they're just starting to get requests for desktop 
Linux computers. Many have never worked with Linux before and are 
looking for a good place to start. Today, we're announcing a program 
that makes it easy and affordable for these small computer companies to 
begin selling LindowsOS computers to their customers looking for 
affordable computing solutions. 

For just $100 a year, anyone who sells computers can get a suite of 
tools to help them install and configure LindowsOS computers and sell 
them to their customers. The program includes all the software you need 
and a license to ship a version of LindowsOS, called LindowsLite, on 
every computer for just $100 a year. This means that "white box" 
computer shops can now sell desktop Linux machines for at least $100 
less per computer than similarly equipped Microsoft Windows XP 
computers due to the savings in operating system licensing fees. 

Benefits of the program: 

Affordable $100/year annual fee 
Digital access to software for immediate deployment 
No registration or activation codes 
Step-by-step guide to building and testing Linux computers 
Professionally designed multimedia tutorials preinstalled on every 
computer, for those new to Linux 

The program is available immediately to any entity that sells 
computers, such as consultants, manufacturers or resellers. We're 
excited because, for the first time, the critically important white box 
manufacturers have a commercially supported program that gives them 
access to high quality software for an affordable price with savings 
that they can pass along to their customers. To learn more or to sign

At Lindows.com, we believe one of the keys for desktop Linux growth is 
that it must continue to target new markets to bring the benefit of 
Linux to the masses. Here's a recap of the affordable ways that 
computer users can get started with LindowsOS and recognize the 
benefits of technology advances, such as a 5 minute installation, 
software that downloads and installs with just one click using 
Click-N-Run and friendly licensing terms which mean no activation codes 
or expiring software! 

Individual users 

For just $49.95, users can immediately download LindowsOS to run on 
their computer. Users can buy a computer pre-loaded with LindowsOS, 
starting at just $199.
