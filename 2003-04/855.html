&gt; My gut reaction is "so what?". Microsoft themselves have decided to pay
&gt; someone to port something rather than waiting for the open source
&gt; community to port it by themselves...

Not really. There allready are linux solutions. But its all about
digital rights managment. Nobody seems to want it. Linux seems to be the
loudest complaint about it. Why DeCSS? Because I cant watch my DVD under
linux. Why no paladin? I wont be able to use it on linux. So if they
port just the key elements of control over then it kinda kills the
loudest arguments against! I think this is a bad thing. Plus it gives
them a chance to bastardise the software like they often seem to have
done in the past with competing products, so that side by side the
windows PC looks better. Will be interesting to see exactly what happens
though. I remember cyberlink powerdvd was meant to be ported to linux
but I dont recall it happening, and now intervideo is their competitor
so does that mean we'll get a linux version of windvd that supports DRM
or what? What if it works well? Will intervideo keep developing linux
tools once they have a working codebase?
