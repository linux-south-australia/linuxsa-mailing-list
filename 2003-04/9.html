Are you using pppoe? What software on esmith?

If so you may find the client MTU needs to be adjusted to bring it down
below 1472.

Good Luck

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;A quick pick of your brains regarding possible causes please:
&gt;
&gt;We have a p3 800 with 256MB Ram box running e-smith as server and gateway.
Realtek
&gt;8139 NICs.
&gt;Recently upgraded it from a dial-up connection to ADSL and added the second
&gt;NIC to do so. The client has complained that often the speed is very slow,
even
&gt;worse than when we had them on the dial-up. This speed loss is inconsistent
&gt;though - client PCs accessing the intenet will often load webpages quickly
and
&gt;download files rapidly at 26kb/s, but then at other times hardly be able to
&gt;load a web page properly.
&gt;
&gt;My feeling is that it is the ADSL line or the modem, as they have already had
&gt;troubles with the line in the past (ISP tested it from their end and
confirmed).
&gt;On the ADSL modem (DSL-300), the ethernet and ADSL connection lights flash
furiously
&gt;all the time, instead of staying on consistently.
&gt;
&gt;I can ping out of this e-smith box, either internally to hosts on the LAN or
&gt;externally to the internet. Can also establish telnet connections to the
box's
&gt;mail ports from an external location. The e-smith resolves names to IP
addresses
&gt;fine.
&gt;
&gt;Their box is also set up the same as one we have here and with the same
version
&gt;of e-smith (5.1.2), and we don't have any problems (though their symptoms
sound
&gt;like ours when the line is playing up).
&gt;
&gt;My question is this: is there anything else that I can test in the e-smith to
&gt;eliminate it as a factor in the lack of speed?
&gt;The ISP help desk has suggested that the client unplug their PCs from the
network
&gt;and then plug them in one at a time to check if there is a PC causing the
fault.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Cheers
&gt;Julian
