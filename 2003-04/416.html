&gt; Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  OK, experts. What's the info about honeyposts. Are they
&gt; &gt;  worthwhile setting up? Are they a nuisance? Is there a
&gt; &gt;  situation where they can mask genuine threats to the
&gt; &gt;  network? Should we bother about them?
&gt; 
&gt; 1) They're a good educational tool
&gt;  - the setup
&gt;  - watching the logs
&gt;  - diagnosing what happened

Agreed.. along with allowing the administrator to capture a new attack. 

&gt; 
&gt; 2) Why would they be a nuisance?

David, 

Depends on what you are wanting to attract. Honeypot have been set up
using older distributions of OS. If someone uses that machine as a
springboard to attack someone else, you could be liable for allowing
that person to attack someone else.


Perhaps the default route could be delete when the box has been
"rooted" or otherwise breached.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Masking genuine threats? Possibly...
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Bothering...maybe?
&gt; 
Though probably not unless you have the resources to be constantly
monitoring the Honeyot for the moment a attacker break into the box. One
possible automated way is to remove the default route from the inside..
:-P... Just a thought..

I'm sure the honeypot project (<A HREF="http://www.honeypot.org">http://www.honeypot.org</A>) has a FAQ
answering these questions. More resources can be found at honeypots.org.

Ian, Unless you have a very good idea as to what you want to acheive,
I'd suggest not doing it.
