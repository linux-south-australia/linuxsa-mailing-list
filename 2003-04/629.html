Hi Matthew,

Matthew Western said:
&gt; Hi All,
&gt; We've a coupla Cyclades Cyclom-Y serial boards that are causing grief
&gt; and looking at replacing them if we can't resolve the issues of
&gt; freezing with their tech support.
&gt;
&gt; What would the group recommend I buy.  Usual features, solid as a brick
&gt; toilet, easy to install, looooong warranty.  PCI i guess as we have two
&gt; we have are ISA.
&gt;
&gt; We have the modems already and I don't think the budget calls for
&gt; modems on the board or anything like that sadly.  :(

Don't know which is the best, we had no problems with Cyclades, but I do
have some Digiboard Xem cards and ports modules looking for a home. We
used them extensively for serial comms (not modem) before we had ethernet.
They were solid for us on earlier RedHat with custom kernels, but I expect
the drivers are mainstream by now. They come with a 12/12 warranty (that's
12 metres or 12 minutes) :)
Reply off list if you are interested, I'd be happy to loan you one for trial.

Michael

&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt; Matthew
