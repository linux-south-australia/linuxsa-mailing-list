&gt; 
&gt; That is, fake the responses to an ICMP scan.

Surely it would be better to just take the machine off the public
Internet. One way to achieve this would be to firewall the machine off,
but as we all now know, firewalls suck ;), so putting it on a
non-routable IP address range might be better.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I also had another idea...hardware related to rooting.  Is there a
&gt;&gt; way to embed commonly "rooted" applications in embedded firware so
&gt;&gt; that commonly rooted applications such as sudo cannot be 
&gt;&gt; overwritten with a trojaned version?

Probably, but you wouldn't solve the common class of exploits where a
buggy program allows attackers to place and/or execute a program 
elsewhere on the system. You don't need to modify an existing program to 
compromise a machine.

It would probably be easier and safer to just use a jail.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Or could a server setup be 100% embedded?
&gt;&gt; 

Running it from a read-only compact-flash card might qualify.

&gt; Sorry...to clarify....can parts of a Linux installation be read only?
&gt; 

Yep. Just install the RO parts onto separate partition(s) and mark them
as RO in /etc/fstab. This is fairly common practice if you are
net-booting, I believe. Usually at least /usr is mounted RO, / can be as 
well provided /var, /tmp and other writeable areas are mounted RW 
somehow. Sometimes applications expect to be able to write to /etc, 
which is a broken thing to do, so that needs to be taken into account as 
well.

Some OS's have additonal security-related features. Eg, I know
FreeBSD has the concept of an "immutable" flag for files and
directories. When combined with a high security-level setting in
rc.conf you can flag files and directores as being unwriteable by
everyone, including root. This allows you to have more fine-grained 
control than marking whole partitions RO.

&gt; 
&gt; Is there a "PGP" for wireless?  That is, the ip addresses are
&gt; encrypted preventing intrusion, but decrypted by the router?

IPSec might be what you're looking for here.
