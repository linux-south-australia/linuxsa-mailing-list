I am using ALSA, I don't think NVIDIA supply an audio driver for the nforce2. 
This machine is running a whole bunch of binary drivers: Lucent Winmodem, 
Nvidia Network Card, and Nvidia Geforce 3 card.

Btw I just tried unloading the nvnet driver and it makes no difference with 
the burning problem. Haven't gotten another kernel panic yet though. I can 
reproduce the burning problem consistently:

1) Start burning something in k3b, e.g. an iso
2) Attempt to start any fullscreen game, e.g. frozen-bubble

At this point the game will not start, although it will be in the process 
list. If you attempt to kill said process it will not die, however the 
request to kill seems to be queued and the program ends up dying once the 
burning is finished.

3) wait til burning finishes, or cancel the burning

At the very instant the burning stops, frozen-bubble will come up.

This is the strangest problem I have ever seen. How on earth is burning and 
switching to fullscreen mode related?

&gt; &gt; Hey,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have installed Mandrake 9.1 on my friends computer which has the
&gt; &gt; following specs:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; nforce 2 motherboard and chipset
&gt; &gt; AMD XP 2100+
&gt; &gt; LITEON burner
&gt; &gt; NVIDIA Geforce 3
&gt; &gt; I think the board has firewire, USB 2.0, some intel audio (haven't got
&gt; &gt; the PC in front of me so I can't get exact information). I have installed
&gt; &gt; the binary only nvnet and nvidia geforce drivers (4191, will soon upgrade
&gt; &gt; to latest).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, Mandrake 9.1 is behaving rather strangely on this computer,
&gt; &gt; problems i've seen are:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) Kernel panicked whilst reading a CD and attempting to play lbreakout2
&gt; &gt; (scroll lock and caps lock lights were flashing and computer stopped
&gt; &gt; responding)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2) Just now, attempted to do a burn, whilst the burn was happening I
&gt; &gt; attempted to load chromium (which would not load) and frozen-bubble
&gt; &gt; (which wouldnt load either).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; chromium and frozen bubble were in the process list, but I could not kill
&gt; &gt; chromium (I didn't try killing frozen-bubble).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Once the burn completed, frozen bubble loaded sprang to life as though it
&gt; &gt; had been sitting there waiting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems that there is a conflict with going to fullscreen mode and using
&gt; &gt; the burner. The process requesting full screen mode just sits there and
&gt; &gt; waits. I could play cannon smash at the same time with no probs (I wasn't
&gt; &gt; in fullscreen mode).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, the burn failed at the very end (the part where it closes the
&gt; &gt; session i think), k3b reported unknown error and the disk was unreadable.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any ideas what on earth is going on? Mandrake 9.1 works fine on my
&gt; &gt; computer (KT266 MB, Athlon T-Bird 1.4, etc)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Damien
