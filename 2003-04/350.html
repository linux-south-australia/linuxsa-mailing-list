&gt; Don't be silly - the "Genetic Diversity" argument against a single
&gt; platform is well established;  Would you have our entire global 
&gt; Internet infrastructure go up in a puff of smoke next time someone
&gt; managed to find an exploit for your "one platform"?

If there were one platform then our effort at making it secure and robust
would be a lot more effective.  Right now our efforts are way diluted
by being spread amongst many different platforms.  In any case, a well
targetted exploit against Cisco would be quite effective in sending the
Internet up in smoke.  Cisco by no means is the only platform controlling
the internet (i.e. genetic diversity) but after all, take out the right
one node and, for any given customer, you might just as well have taken
out the whole Internet.  Let's also not lose sight of the fact that a
quick reboot cures most ills.  Should someone find a way to kill the one
platform, a solution will quickly be found: then re-load, apply the patch,
and re-enable network access; et voilla.

The fact is that we did leave it computing to diversity, and the best that
Apple, CDC, Cray, Digital, HP, IBM, NCR, NCR, Nixdorf, Sun, Tandem Unisys,
and a cast of thousands of others could do was to create an environment
that was hoplessly expensive, quite lacking in inter-operability, locked
the opposition out of "their own" customers, and generally kept computing
in the dark ages.  I claim that Microsoft and Intel, by giving us a common
platform, have done more to drive down the price and beef up the features
of computing than any other organisation before.  So it's not perfect.
Name one platform that is.
