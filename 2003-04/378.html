&gt; ALL the cords and cables? It sounds like you got some of the cables on
&gt; the wrong drives...eg you may have accidentally swapped a master for a
&gt; slave.

no.  i didn't touch the inside of the PC before the problem came up.
but afterwards i tried changing things around to eliminate problems.
i even tried the linux drive on its own as master (which it was before).

i tried disconnecting both cdroms and the slave hard drive and still the same 
problem.

There were no changes to inside the case when the problem occurred.  I had 
only unplugged the cords from the back of the case because i was going to 
move the pc.  (it was actually to be used for a presentation later 
on...luckily i got it working in the nick of time...).  but i decided to 
change something and plugged the pc back in where it was...and this is when 
the problem occurred.

So with no changes inside the case at all, and all that happened was i 
unplugged and plugged the keyboard, mouse, power, and video cable....i have 
no idea what caused it.

it seems to be a quirck with the bootloader.  i havent seen the problem under 
grub but this is the second time i've seen it with lilo (both times on a 
mandrake distro - i also remember changing to grub last time for the same 
reason - just in case).
