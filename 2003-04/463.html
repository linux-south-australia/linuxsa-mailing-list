&gt; Perhaps you've mentioned this in earlier posts, (since I'm new here),
&gt; but I'm curious as to why you think "firewalls are mostly useless"?

I tend to agree with Stephen about firewalls.  I have a couple of
issues with firewalls, and perhaps the most important is that you do
not need one if the machines behind it are secure.  What firewalls
can do is give you the sense that your local machines don't need to be
secure because the firewall gives you total security.  That is quite
wrong.  What firewalls can do is give you a false sense of security.
They can make you complacent.  False security is worse than no security.
Firewalls also do get in the way; that's their purpose.  Many people,
when the firewall gets in the way, simply poke a hole through it without
really thinking about the ramifications.  Perhaps they find they can't
send mail from their favoured email client, so they open up the SMTP port.
Lookout!  Who knows what buffer overflow is there to be exploited.

I think there is no substitute for locking down each and every machine.
And if each machine is locked down, a firewall really adds very little.
It presents, perhaps, an additional obstacle for the hacker to circumvent,
but as I already said, that comes at the cost of an obstacle to the
people it is supposed to protect.

One thing that a firewall can do quite well is enforce certain global
security policies on a network.  I've used them to ensure that all email
goes through a central email host; which can be used to log incoming and
outgoing email, and to rewrite addresses so they conform to organisational
standards.  I've also used them to ensure that intrinsically insecure
protocols, such as telnet or ftp, are not used; that stops passwords
being sent in the clear.
