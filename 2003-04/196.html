Adam,

&gt; Also, are there contact details for ComputerBank.. My grandmother saw
&gt; it on channel 7 the other day, and suggested i might like to get
&gt; involved. I would, and would like to contact them.

ComputerBank's SA web-page is:

 * <A HREF="http://sa.computerbank.org.au/">http://sa.computerbank.org.au/</A>

Romana (<A HREF="mailto:romana@timelady.com">romana@timelady.com</A>) who has that hugely long signature is
currently the best person to contact about getting involved, however I
should warn you that she may simply forward your details to me depending
on how you'd like to help out.

[I'm the current Technical/Hardware Coordinator for CAISA]

The CSDN-SA is holding a get together this Saturday at Robyn Manning's
place in Parkholme from 3-5 PM so you'd be welcome to drop by and say
hello to me then. Romana may be coming depending on her prior
commitments.

I hope this helps!

{...and as a sideline, we have more recipients than machines at the
moment so if it's not total junk and you want to donate it to a worthy
cause, feel free to talk to me about it; we also have contacts with
computer recyclers so that the useless junk doesn't get into landfill so
please talk to us before sending your totally useless junk to landfill
which is filling up...}
