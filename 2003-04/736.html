These sound like fighting words. Is there any truth to what Ballmer says?

<A HREF="http://news.com.com/2008-1082-998297.html?tag">http://news.com.com/2008-1082-998297.html?tag</A>=fd_lede1_hed

&gt; Sitting down for an in-depth interview with CNET News.com, Ballmer 
&gt; discussed the Linux phenomenon as well as a range of other issues 
&gt; facing Microsoft.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Q: Microsoft has beaten companies touting free software before. But as 
&gt; one of your former executives pointed out, Linux is a completely 
&gt; different kind of free. There is no single company promoting it. There 
&gt; are people voluntarily coding for it. Do these aspects change how you 
&gt; compete against them.
&gt;  A: We have competed with things that had no price attached with them 
&gt; before. There is a clear set of guideposts for adding value to 
&gt; customers to differentiate you from the guy who has no price or a 
&gt; lower price. It is a different model in the sense that there is no 
&gt; commercial company behind it, but I think that winds up being an 
&gt; advantage for us, rather than a disadvantage.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; In what respect?
&gt;  Innovation is not something that is easy to do in the kind of 
&gt; distributed environment that the open-source/Linux world works in. I 
&gt; would argue that our customers have seen a lot more innovation from us 
&gt; than they have seen from that community.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Linux itself is a clone of an operating system that is 20-plus years 
&gt; old. That's what it is. That is what you can get today, a clone of a 
&gt; 20-year-old system. I'm not saying that it doesn't have some place for 
&gt; some customers, but that is not an innovative proposition.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Some people say it is an advantage that Linux gets built in all of 
&gt; these little pieces. The fact is that if you want to do some kind of 
&gt; integrated innovation that touches the kernel, that touches the user 
&gt; interface--there is no way. Maybe Linus (Torvalds) can control the 
&gt; innovation in the piece called the kernel, but there are many pieces.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The Linux world in some sense is a lot like the Unix world. There is 
&gt; not much communality. There is this distribution; there is that 
&gt; distribution. There is this user interface, there is that. Some people 
&gt; might see some advantages to that. On the other hand, in terms of 
&gt; putting a clear, simple proposition in front of the customer, I think 
&gt; we have a leading edge proposition.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Linux itself is a clone of an operating system that is twenty-plus 
&gt; years old. That's what it is.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So when it comes to development models, you're claiming the edge?
&gt;  If you want a fix now, we may need to perform better, but you know 
&gt; where to go. There is nobody to turn to if you as a (Linux) customer 
&gt; says, 'I need this.' You can't turn to IBM. They don't write the 
&gt; thing. It's not like IBM can support Linux the way they support the 
&gt; mainframe operating system. They don't write the code for it. All they 
&gt; can say is, 'You can call us and ask us a question, but if you 
&gt; actually want something done we can't do it.'
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; But why do you think people are adopting Linux? Is it because they can 
&gt; look at the code? Is it because they don't have to go through an 
&gt; 80-page licensing agreement?
&gt;  No. There are some scenarios where people consider it. People don't 
&gt; really consider Linux much on the client--that's my market 
&gt; observation. On the server side, you have people who have skill sets 
&gt; and applications on Sun that they want to move now to Intel hardware 
&gt; to save costs. I think we have a pretty good story, but I tell you, 
&gt; game's on. We've got to prove ourselves, and some people are choosing 
&gt; Linux. I don't think that is going to continue to be the case.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; In the past you've used strong words like "cancer" to describe Linux. 
&gt; There is the un-American comment from a colleague about GPL (General 
&gt; Public License) and open source. Are you backing off from that 
&gt; position and taking more of a technological or business view?
&gt;  I think there are many parts of the discussion. I do think there are 
&gt; things that people don't understand very well about the new 
&gt; alternative, where it is important for us to help customers understand 
&gt; the issues.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  The way things are structured today, from a licensing perspective, in 
&gt; the Linux world nobody will ever commercialize Linux the way the Sun 
&gt; commercialized FreeBSD. For some customers, that can be viewed as 
&gt; advantageous. But customers will never really know who stands behind 
&gt; this product. If the lead developer for this component chooses to do 
&gt; something else with his life, who will carry on the mantle for that? 
&gt; The fact that it will never be commercialized is assured by the GPL. 
&gt; The GPL licensing form does that, as opposed to the open-source 
&gt; license for FreeBSD, where you could say Sun took it and 
&gt; commercialized it and can say that they own it. Nobody can ever do 
&gt; that (with GPL).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There are advantages (to Windows) that are more subtle. We may not 
&gt; have always been sharp in the way we have communicated about those 
&gt; (laughs), but there are some things that are important for customers 
&gt; to understand. We think that in some sense our commercial form is a 
&gt; major asset for us.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Gauge the piracy problem. Are you finally getting a handle on it?
&gt;  Some countries yes, some countries no. It has improved certainly in 
&gt; Europe, particularly in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe. Piracy was 
&gt; high at one time. There are still challenges in parts of Asia. We have 
&gt; seen improvements in Latin America.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  What is driving it, legal enforcement or a growing PC industry that 
&gt; wants to make money?
&gt;  Both. It really takes both. Neither one nor the other by itself is 
&gt; generally enough.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; On the desktop, in developing countries, computer dealers will tell 
&gt; you that they sell Linux-based PCs, but in a lot of these places, 
&gt; Windows only costs $1 in the street.
&gt;  A Linux PC in most countries is a PC in which somebody is being 
&gt; encouraged to pirate Windows. We conducted some surveys about this in 
&gt; one large Asian country, where we found that, of all PCs that didn't 
&gt; have Windows installed on them when they were sold, 99 percent wound 
&gt; up with Windows on them within 30 days.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Who is the target audience for Windows 2003 server? Is it Windows 4.0 
&gt; users? The Unix crowd?
&gt;  The initial market will probably evolve into three categories. 
&gt; Category No. 1 will be NT 4.0 users. There are a lot out there, and I 
&gt; think we offer an important step forward. It's not like a client, 
&gt; where everybody might want to upgrade at the same time, but I think 
&gt; we've set up a real wave there.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; No. 2, there are people moving applications from expensive gear onto 
&gt; cheap gear. I think Windows Server 2003 is going to look good to a lot 
&gt; of that community. Those are high-performance computing applications, 
&gt; or applications running on Solaris or AIX.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; And No. 3, people who want to put in new applications or people who 
&gt; want to support new working information-type scenarios--and people are 
&gt; always putting in new applications. They really are.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There are millions of new servers sold a year, and that is a market 
&gt; that continues to grow. It grows faster than the PC market does. By 
&gt; hook or by crook, so to speak, there will be 5-plus million servers, 
&gt; roughly, sold in the next 12 months.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Over time, will servers become 50 percent of your business?
&gt;  It's not a line of dialogue I choose to engage in because then all 
&gt; you are doing is comparing the growth prospects of various businesses. 
&gt; I think we have great growth opportunities in our server business. I 
&gt; think we have great growth opportunities in small business and medium 
&gt; business, as well as the enterprise. I think the percentage growth 
&gt; rate in that (the server) business will exceed that which we see in 
&gt; the Windows client business or the Office business. But those are huge 
&gt; businesses. This is a very large business, but those are huge businesses
