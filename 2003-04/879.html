&gt; &gt; My gut reaction is "so what?". Microsoft themselves have decided to pay
&gt; &gt; someone to port something rather than waiting for the open source
&gt; &gt; community to port it by themselves...
&gt; 
&gt; Not really. There allready are linux solutions. But its all about
&gt; digital rights managment. Nobody seems to want it. Linux seems to be the
&gt; loudest complaint about it. Why DeCSS? Because I cant watch my DVD under

This paragraph sums that up:


"More importantly, porting to Linux allows Microsoft to get its
digital-rights management software into the consumer device market. This
puts Redmond in a position to be a gatekeeper for Hollywood and the music
industry, which already have seen what happens when consumers start
swapping digital files. This gatekeeper role could be highly profitable for
Microsoft."


"to he a gatekeeper for Hollywood and the music industry."

That's all they're interested in.  They're not interested in the fact that
this is Linux -- what's most important to Microsoft is that they don't get
lost along the way.  Remember how many of the massive companies approached
to implement MS-Passport considered and rejected the system?  I think
Microsoft are planning to throw themselves through the door this time,
instead of just putting their foot in it and hoping it will open.
