Rekall from www.thekompany.com always seems a good commercial way to go as 
well.

&gt; A guy on the Lindows forum found a Mysql/ODBC/Postgres database frony end 
&gt; that I can even understand. :-)
&gt;
&gt; The name is knoda, with the home page at: www.knoda.org
&gt;
&gt; I was able to easily import an Open Office 1.0 csv file into Knoda, and 
&gt; Knoda was able to create a table from that very easily.
&gt;
&gt; Knoda looks very promising to me, I did crash when I tried to work with 
&gt; anything other than the table. I hope to find an answer to that soon.
&gt;
&gt; Knoda is a KDE application,  and it works on SuSE 8.1 Professional _if_ 
&gt; you have upgraded your kde to 3.1. It would not start under 3.0, and LyX 
&gt; 3.1 would not start as well.
&gt;
&gt; SuSE has a page that lists all of the versions of SuSE that can be 
&gt; upgraded to KDE 8.1 on this page:
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/us/private/download/linuks/index.html">http://www.suse.com/us/private/download/linuks/index.html</A>
&gt;
&gt; I am going to write @ my experiences with SuSE 8.1 during the upgrade 
&gt; from KDE 3.0.4 to 3.1.
&gt;
&gt; The first thing I did was run a program called siga, which creates a file 
&gt; called /tmp/siga/siga.txt.  This file contains a very comprehensive 
&gt; report on your system, including RPM packages that are installed on the 
&gt; box. I copied the file to my home directory by going to the console and 
&gt; typing the following:
&gt;
&gt; cp /tmp/siga/siga.txt /home/james
&gt;
&gt; I then changed the owner of the file from root to James, so I could read 
&gt; it:
&gt;
&gt; chown james siga.txt
&gt; chgrp users siga.txt
&gt;
&gt; I then was able to open up LyX by using my mouse to go 
&gt; toKmenu/Office/Word Processor/LyX. If you do not have LyX installed, you 
&gt; can install it through the Yast Control Center.
&gt;
&gt; In Lyx just go to File/Import/ascii text as lines/ and select siga.txt.
&gt;
&gt; It will automatically create a siga.lyx file for you. Save that by going 
&gt; to file/save.
&gt;
&gt; Create a new document with file/new and then call it apps, and save it. 
&gt; On the first line, put the title of the document, and then go to the left 
&gt; and select title. It will format it for you. Really easy by the way.
&gt;
&gt; Go back to the siga.lyx document by selecting documents/siga.lyx 
&gt; Highlight section 2 and then go back to apps.lyx and then paste. Print 
&gt; that out.
&gt;
&gt; Now, I pretty much have SuSE 8.1's default installation on my machine, 
&gt; along with a few extra applications including apt.  Apt is not a 
&gt; requirement, but it will make your life a heck of a lot easier.  To 
&gt; install apt, just do a yahoo search for apt for SuSE, and try to follow a 
&gt; post I made on this earlier if the instructions on the web page are not 
&gt; clear.
&gt;
&gt; A word of warning on this before you start....don't shut down the 
&gt; computer, or even close the shell while you are in the middle of doing 
&gt; this. KDE displays your shell, and if you are not comfortable not having 
&gt; access to KDE, closing the shell or restarting the computer while you are 
&gt; upgrading is a sure way to get yourself in a jam.
&gt;
&gt; Bottom line is, see the procedure through to completion, and enjoy a 
&gt; smooth process.
&gt;
&gt; Back to SuSE's web page.  Since I have SuSE 8.1, I went to that page, 
&gt; which has a listing of all the SuSE applicaitons available for 8.1:
&gt;
&gt; On this page there are 5 package groups:
&gt;
&gt; * Base packages
&gt;
&gt; * Language Support
&gt;
&gt; * KDE Applications
&gt;
&gt; KDE Development Packages
&gt;
&gt; Expirimental KDE Packages
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; *Most people will only want to use these.
&gt;
&gt; I installed the packages in the order listed on the page.
&gt;
&gt; I first installed arts, arts-gmcop, and kde2-compat.
&gt;
&gt; NOTE: The _next thing I SHOULD have done was UNINSTALL pixieplus-kde. If 
&gt; you do this BEFORE you install kdebase3, all will go smooth all the way 
&gt; through the end of the base package installations.
&gt;
&gt; As for language support, I only installed kde3-i18n-en_GB and koffice- 
&gt; i18n-en_GB.
&gt;
&gt; In the KDE Applications section, all went smoothly as I only selected 
&gt; applications that I already had installed.  However, you ought to install 
&gt; knoda & hk_classes, both of which are listed in this section.
&gt;
&gt; Now, before I installed KDE games, I had to uninstall the remaining kde 
&gt; 3.0.4 applications and Kile.
&gt; The following command worked nicely:
&gt;
&gt; rpm -qa | grep 3.0.4 | xargs rpm -e
&gt;
&gt; Note that you can just run:
&gt;
&gt; rpm -qa | grep 3.0.4
&gt;
&gt; To see what will be uninstalled.
&gt;
&gt; By the way mine was 3.0.4 because I had already ran the Automatic update 
&gt; in the Yast 2 Control Center in SuSE 8.1. (If the Auto update does not 
&gt; work in SuSE 8.1, use apt to reinstall yast2-core, yast2-packager and 
&gt; yast2-packagemanager with apt:  apt-get install yast2-core yast2-packager 
&gt; yast2-packagemanager.
&gt;
&gt; Go ahead and run the command, reinstall Kile with apt, and then proceed 
&gt; down the list.
&gt;
&gt; When you are finished, you will have a working kde3.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Ok, now for Knoda.
&gt;
&gt; If you don't have mysql installed, install it.
&gt;
&gt; Go to your shell and type this command to make mysql useable:
&gt;
&gt; mysqladmin -u root password the_password_you_want_to_use
&gt;
&gt; Example, if I wanted to use OpenUP as my password, I would type the 
&gt; following at the shell:
&gt;
&gt; mysqladmin -u root password OpenUP
&gt;
&gt; To start knoda, type knoda at the console.
&gt;
&gt; Select mysql
&gt;
&gt; Select Connect
&gt;
&gt; You are root and the password is whatever you picked.   (You can worry 
&gt; about permissions later. But not too much later. :))
&gt;
&gt; As in access, there are these categories to work with listed:
&gt;
&gt; Databases
&gt;
&gt; Tables
&gt;
&gt; Queries
&gt;
&gt; Forms
&gt;
&gt; Reports
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Lets import our table:
&gt;
&gt; Go to action, import, CSV, and take in your table.
&gt;
&gt; You can double click on your table and print it.
&gt;
&gt; I imagine that the rest would work just like MS Access, which I have used 
&gt; often.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; James Leone
&gt;
&gt; P.S. LyX looked a heck of a lot nicer and was easier to work with after I 
&gt; upgraded to 1.3.1.
&gt;
