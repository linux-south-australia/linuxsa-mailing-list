Adam,
Do you allow both incoming and outgoing port 53 UDP AND TCP from your dns 
server to the rest of the world?

&gt; &gt; Adam,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is now also becoming a problem because our DNS server appears to have
&gt; &gt; &gt; cached the fact that i can't look up the host smtp01.seinf.abb.se.  This
&gt; &gt; &gt; is causing email to stop going to that host, and in particular one user
&gt; &gt; &gt; here needs to email that host with urgent information.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is the name server caching the record or is it perhaps the MTA? Try using
&gt; &gt; the 'host' command to look up the record:
&gt; 
&gt; The MTA (I expect lots of dropped jaws from this,) is on the Windows
&gt; platform at this time.  Using it's nslookup command I am still unable to
&gt; resolve the host.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; $ host -t any smtp01.seinf.abb.se [NAMESERVER.ADDRESS]
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; and see what comes back. If you get the correct details back, then it
&gt; &gt; could be the MTA doing the caching. Try stopping and starting your MTA.
&gt; &gt; When I try it I do not get any MX records back, but I do get an A record.
&gt; &gt; When I look up the parent domain I get different MX records:
&gt; 
&gt; The remote mail host is es.abb.se, and the host command tells me that it's
&gt; MX's are:
&gt; 
&gt; # host es.abb.com
&gt; es.abb.com mail is handled (pri=10) by smtp01.seinf.abb.se
&gt; es.abb.com mail is handled (pri=20) by smtp02.seinf.abb.se
&gt; es.abb.com mail is handled (pri=30) by sdas01.seinf.abb.se
&gt; 
&gt; Running host -a tells me this:
&gt; 
&gt; # host -a smtp02.seinf.abb.se
&gt; Trying null domain
&gt; rcode = 0 (Success), ancount=1
&gt; The following answer is not authoritative:
&gt; The following answer is not verified as authentic by the server:
&gt; smtp02.seinf.abb.se     21425 IN        A       138.221.225.25
&gt; For authoritative answers, see:
&gt; seinf.abb.se    82528 IN        NS      dns6.telia.com
&gt; seinf.abb.se    82528 IN        NS      sdas01.seinf.abb.se
&gt; seinf.abb.se    82528 IN        NS      sdav01.seinf.abb.se
&gt; Additional information:
&gt; sdas01.seinf.abb.se     82528 IN        A       138.221.200.200
&gt; sdav01.seinf.abb.se     82528 IN        A       138.221.200.99
&gt; 
&gt; It tells me smtp02.seinf.abb.se is 138.221.225.25, and using dig I appear
&gt; to be able to resolve it, but not with nslookup.
&gt; 
&gt; smtp01 and smtp02 appear to point to the same IP address.  I'm confused as
&gt; to why nslookup is having so much trouble resolving this with our local
&gt; name server.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been about 20 hours since I looked at this yesterday.
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:bugman@jerome">bugman@jerome</A> /home/bugman # nslookup smtp01.seinf.abb.se
&gt; Server:  jerome.sage
&gt; Address:  192.168.0.3
&gt; 
&gt; *** jerome.sage can't find smtp01.seinf.abb.se: Non-existent host/domain
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:bugman@jerome">bugman@jerome</A> /home/bugman # nslookup smtp01.seinf.abb.se ns1.on.net
&gt; Server:  ns1.on.net
&gt; Address:  216.200.145.64
&gt; 
&gt; Non-authoritative answer:
&gt; Name:    smtp01.seinf.abb.se
&gt; Address:  138.221.225.24
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I can not seem to purge the cache of our current DNS server, and it keeps
&gt; &gt; &gt; returning "Non-existent host/domain" when every other name server I try
&gt; &gt; &gt; can resolve the host name.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As others have said, doing a '/etc/init.d/named stop' and then
&gt; &gt; '/etc/init.d/named start' should clear the cache (which is kept in memory
&gt; &gt; IIRC).
&gt; 
&gt; Doing that has no effect.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also, is your nameserver a slave for the remote? If it is perhaps it's not
&gt; &gt; pulling down the updated zone file. Stop the nameserver as above and then
&gt; &gt; remove the zone file for that zone and start it up again.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not quite sure what you are referring to, but there's no forwarders
&gt; section in my named.conf if that's what you mean.
&gt; 
&gt; After enabling the 'forwarders' section and specifying Internode's name
&gt; server, I'm suddenly able to resolve the host.  This still begs the
&gt; question as to why I have been unable to resolve it "on my own," without
&gt; the benefit of an upstream cache :/
&gt;
