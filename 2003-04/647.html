&gt; The fact that wars continue is undoubted, but the fact so many revile 
&gt; it, question it, and protest it, is a direct tribute to the men and 
&gt; women who died during war so that we had the right, the freedom, and 
&gt; ability to protest, think, debate, and try to stop war.


That just sounds wrong... we had to fight a war so we could in the 
future protest against war. Well if it makes you feel better you might 
as well keep thinking like that. The real horror is that those brave 
diggers died protecting the British Empire, which represented the 
opposite of  "freedom, and ability to protest, think (and) debate" to 
many if not all of the native people it conquered or destroyed 
(including India, Australia, half of Africa and all the other countless 
countries). The truth is we have never declared war on any nation that 
was directly threatening us. Of the following : The Boer War, WWI, WWII, 
Korea, Vietnam, Gulf I, Gulf II, which represent most of the conflicts 
we have fought in, only during WWII were we actually threatened.

What may sound nice isn't necessarily true.
Daniel.
