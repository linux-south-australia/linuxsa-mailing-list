I'm sure I didn't say that they are crap.  I think what I said was that
people put more faith in their firewalls than is warranted.


&gt; Not everyone can/needs to do everything to protect their network.  A 
&gt; firewall is (normally) the cheapest and easiest way to start protecting 
&gt; a network. 

What sort of protection is it if you don't understand what it protects
you from?  Surely, at best, it's incomplete protection.  At worst it's
no protection.


&gt; Having some security is better than none at all.

I don't think so.  I've so often heard, "I don't have to worry about
virii because I run a virus checker."  I think I'd rather such people
NOT run a virus checker because then they WOULD worry.  It's the same
with firewalls.  (And yes, I have also heard people say that they have
a firewall so they don't need to worry about security.)


By no means do I think that firewalls are crap, but I do think that
they are oversold.  "I don't have to worry about illness because I
take vitamins."
