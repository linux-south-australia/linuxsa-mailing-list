Daniel,

 &gt; So anything that works financially also works, by default, ethically?

Absolutely not.

My bottom line is that if Microsoft sells a subsidised product and is 
upfront with the associated cost of software (and other terms and 
conditions) and does this with reasonable clarity to the consumer I 
don't see a problem with it. People takes responsibility for their 
actions. Generally it's the guardian who buys the hardware and games.

Even if a kid buys the subsidised product it's pretty obvious how much 
the software costs because it's evident from the store's wall-covered 
titles. Generally people pick out at least one title when picking up a 
console.

Cheers,
Joseph Tan

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;You're suggesting that actually subsidising a toy (albeit a 
&gt;&gt;sophisticated one) is unethical? The worst thing this does is increase 
&gt;&gt;the cost of the actual game software if they actually want to make a 
&gt;&gt;profit. Consumer factor this in and evaluate its true overall value to 
&gt;&gt;themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't see a problem with their business model. I don't mind buying a
&gt; cheap console and paying more for games. But this is not "the worst
&gt; thing this does".
&gt; 
&gt; The worst thing this does, is make people think that it is OK to 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Keep in mind that their biggest competitor (Sony) also do this, and to a 
&gt;&gt;smaller degree Nintendo.
&gt;&gt;
