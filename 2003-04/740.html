<H1>[OT} My ANZAC Day</H1>

ANZAC Day for me was a good day as days like that go.

I got into town early and met up with the few left from Dad's ship, 
HMAS Australia (about 15 in the Adelaide march). I took in a few photos 
of the ship and crew that Dad brought back with him (might even post 
some if anybody is interested) and they really enjoyed the reminiscing.

Odd thing, I would introduce myself and they would shake my hand, then 
I would explain that I was Merve's son. Darn me if they didn't shake my 
hand again, "for Dad". Rocked me as it happened with several of them.

They were just about to move out for the march so I said goodbye. They 
asked where I was heading off to. I said that I was heading to the spot 
where we traditionally stood for the march past. "Blow that", says Col, 
the Patron, "You march with us in Dad's old place." Fighting back tears 
I gratefully accepted their offer, and darn me if I felt Dad was there 
with me amongst his mates. What a feeling, hard, much too hard to 
describe what it felt like to be amongst them as they marched.

After the march I was pooped and they were all many years older than my 
50 so I expect they would have been a bit done in too. They all asked 
me to go back to their regular pub with them but I decided to stay back 
at the Cross of Sacrifice for the Remembrance Service. We always did 
that so it felt right to be doing it again. So the service finally 
starts and I stutter my way through "O Valiant Hearts" then after a 
prayer we get to the Sailor's Hymn, "Eternal Father".

I lost it again thinking of how many times Dad would have sung that 
whilst in Service, and then so many times at ANZAC and Remembrance Day 
services since then.
   "Oh hear us then when we cry to Thee
   "For those in peril on the sea..."

The Last Post was also difficult for me. Emotionally this had not been 
a real easy day for me so far but I figured it was the right thing to 
do in Dad's memory.

ANZAC Day, not just a collection of old farts dreaming of past glories 
and glorifying war, not even close to it. Not one of them wished they 
were back in war and under fire, not a one of them.
