Hi

Computer cases unless they are of the more expensive sturdy variety
don't always like being moved and can make a drive cable loose enough
not to work. That doesn't mean it has to be off not to work either.

Lilo expects partitions to remain in their place ie /boot / /etc etc.
Correct me if I'm wrong someone but doesn't the kernel load from the
boot sector then it goes looking for partitions part way through
loading. If a hard drive isn't there that was before something vital
could be missing. Are all your Linux partitions on the one drive?

If you could get that graphical screen off then you could see how far
through loading that your machine got.

If lilo.conf had been changed by any of the Mandrake graphical tools did
that tool finish off properly by running lilo again after the changes?

&gt; no.  i didn't touch the inside of the PC before the problem came up.
&gt; but afterwards i tried changing things around to eliminate problems.
&gt; i even tried the linux drive on its own as master (which it was before).
&gt; 
&gt; i tried disconnecting both cdroms and the slave hard drive and still the same 
&gt; problem.
&gt; 
&gt; There were no changes to inside the case when the problem occurred.  I had 
&gt; only unplugged the cords from the back of the case because i was going to 
&gt; move the pc.  (it was actually to be used for a presentation later 
&gt; on...luckily i got it working in the nick of time...).  but i decided to 
&gt; change something and plugged the pc back in where it was...and this is when 
&gt; the problem occurred.
&gt; 
&gt; So with no changes inside the case at all, and all that happened was i 
&gt; unplugged and plugged the keyboard, mouse, power, and video cable....i have 
&gt; no idea what caused it.
&gt; 
&gt; it seems to be a quirck with the bootloader.  i havent seen the problem under 
&gt; grub but this is the second time i've seen it with lilo (both times on a 
&gt; mandrake distro - i also remember changing to grub last time for the same 
&gt; reason - just in case).
