With apologies to our overseas friends.

To me Anzac Day made me feel - well "Australian". Going to dawn services 
engendered a feeling of being Australian in me. Maybe the loss brought us 
together in mourning and grief. This was followed by a celebration of this 
country. 
That feeling seems to have vanished this year. Some of the things that I 
valued about Australia have in recent times been lost, trodden on, and walked 
over.

&gt; Brian,
&gt;
&gt; I used to think a bit the same way - I perceived Anzac Day as too much
&gt; glorification or celebration of a tragic event, that symbolises all the
&gt; horror of war.
&gt;
&gt; But its not. Its a celebration of the courage of all those who
&gt; sacrificed for something they believed in, and a poignant reminder to us
&gt; all that we must never let be that sacrifice be diminshed or forgotten.
&gt;
&gt; The fact that wars continue is undoubted, but the fact so many revile
&gt; it, question it, and protest it, is a direct tribute to the men and
&gt; women who died during war so that we had the right, the freedom, and
&gt; ability to protest, think, debate, and try to stop war.
&gt;
&gt; My girls go to the dawn service every year, and this is what I have
&gt; explained to them its for. Its not a public holiday, its a day to
&gt; remember, be grateful, thankful to those who sacrificed.
&gt;
&gt; Lest we forget.
