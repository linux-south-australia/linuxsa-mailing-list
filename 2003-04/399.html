Hey,

I was at a 21st the other night and we had a Kareoke machine. It rebooted 
randomly twice over a 4 hour period, losing people's songlists that they had 
cued up. Oh boy, when are people going to realise that custom devices work 
better with a Free operating system, I'm sure Linux or *BSD would've done 
fine. The hardware it would've had to support was:

Display via a monitor and TV at the same time with different output on each 
display... I'm sure xinerama and a supported video card could achieve this.

Touchscreen display

Infrared drivers for custom remote control.

Not sure what the sound system was. I would assume that all the tracks/videos 
were on the harddrive and it wasn't running some sort of CD jukebox. The 
soundcard would've needed 3 mic inputs. It also had some lights that flashed 
in time with the music, not sure if the signal processing for that was 
handled in software or in hardware. I would assume hardware.

I'm sure there's drivers lying around for this sort of thing. I read all this 
stuff about Linux gaining ground in embedded devices, POS terminals, etc. But 
when am I going to see it in little 'ol Adelaide? Every POS machine I see is 
running DOS or Windows.


Damien
