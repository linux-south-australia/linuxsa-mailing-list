&gt; Yep, because we are slack arses who want to run MIME defang

It made me curious about the effects of running SpamAssassin
on an already SA'd email (or more correctly, one which had
SA headers in it).  Does SA replace previous X-Spam headers,
or just add to existing ones?  If the latter, one might fall
foul of "header non-determinism" (i.e. which spam score header
came first).  This makes me also wonder if spammers will start
inserting 'X-Spam-Status: No' headers into email in order to
circumvent end users spam detection (probably unlikely, given
the payoff and the amount of difficulty spammers have getting
email to be even vaguely RFC compliant).

All this is just idle speculation.  If I was really curious,
I'd download the package and find out for myself, rather than
avoiding job work by replying to emails.  Sigh.

&gt; As a minor optimisation we don't scan outgoing e-mail to
&gt; AARNet mailing lists (as this was done when the message
&gt; came into the mailing list so the other 500-odd virus
&gt; scans of the same message, but outgoing, aren't necessary).

It's a valid optimisation.  What's the criteria for selectively
switching off the scanning?
