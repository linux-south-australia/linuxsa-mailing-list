&gt; Related, the number of Internet-visible HP LaserJets is
&gt; astonishing.  The one thing you'd think should be
&gt; on a unrouted 10.0.0.0 network.

Since I've had a few e-mails addressed to me, let me
explain.

The 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 addresses can be used
within your network.  They are not allowed to be
advertised to the Internet.

So you can place all the stuff you don't want accessed
from the Internet into a 10.0.0.0/8 subnet.  If you
use ethernet switching, then you place that subnet
into its own VLAN.

At first glance it seems that users that need to access
the printers need to be in the 10.0.0.0/8 subnet/VLAN,
so how do they access the Internet?

But thinking about it, there's only one user of the
printer -- the print spooler (lpd, LPDng, CUPS, etc).
So the machine with the print spooler needs two
interfaces -- one in the usual network and one in
the 10.0.0.0/8 subnet.

These interfaces don't need to by physically distinct
interfaces -- an ethernet 802.1Q trunk carrying the
main and 10.0.0.0/8 VLANs would be fine.

This arrangement also has the advantage of forcing
all users through the print spooler.  So you don't
get unstoppable jobs, or unaccounted jobs and can
give users virtual queues (such as queues for
massive jobs or for A3 jobs).

If you use CUPS you can easily make all printers visible to
lpd (UNIX, later Mac), IPP (UNIX, later Windows, later
Mac, later NetWare), SMB (Windows), AppleTalk (early Mac)
and IPX (NetWare).

  +---------+         Printer    Printer
  |         |            |          |
  |         +------------+----------+  10.0.0.0/8
  | Spooler |
  |         +-------- Users
  |         |
  +---------+

You should also put some other devices into non-routed
subnets: the administrative interfaces for switches
and routers; iBGP routing prefix distribution; SNMP
interfaces; RADIUS and other accounting traffic;
syslog messages.

As a final clarification, 10.0.0.0/8 addresses are
often used for Network Address Translation (NAT).
This isn't the same application: NATing a non-routed
subnet is counter-productive.
