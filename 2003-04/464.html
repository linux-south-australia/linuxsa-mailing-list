David,
I reckon I can summarize what you've said like this:

Firewalls enforce a security and other policies whether written or implied.

If your organization does not have a good security policy and/or only lip 
service is paid to it then a firewall isn't going to help much.

A good security policy and a organizational buy in to that policy is really 
what you need.  A living, breathing security policy that is really followed, 
really relevant and actively updated as part of normal everyday business 
processes is critical.

Everything else derives from that.

&gt; &gt; Perhaps you've mentioned this in earlier posts, (since I'm new here),
&gt; &gt; but I'm curious as to why you think "firewalls are mostly useless"?
&gt; 
&gt; I tend to agree with Stephen about firewalls.  I have a couple of
&gt; issues with firewalls, and perhaps the most important is that you do
&gt; not need one if the machines behind it are secure.  What firewalls
&gt; can do is give you the sense that your local machines don't need to be
&gt; secure because the firewall gives you total security.  That is quite
&gt; wrong.  What firewalls can do is give you a false sense of security.
&gt; They can make you complacent.  False security is worse than no security.
&gt; Firewalls also do get in the way; that's their purpose.  Many people,
&gt; when the firewall gets in the way, simply poke a hole through it without
&gt; really thinking about the ramifications.  Perhaps they find they can't
&gt; send mail from their favoured email client, so they open up the SMTP port.
&gt; Lookout!  Who knows what buffer overflow is there to be exploited.
&gt; 
&gt; I think there is no substitute for locking down each and every machine.
&gt; And if each machine is locked down, a firewall really adds very little.
&gt; It presents, perhaps, an additional obstacle for the hacker to circumvent,
&gt; but as I already said, that comes at the cost of an obstacle to the
&gt; people it is supposed to protect.
&gt; 
&gt; One thing that a firewall can do quite well is enforce certain global
&gt; security policies on a network.  I've used them to ensure that all email
&gt; goes through a central email host; which can be used to log incoming and
&gt; outgoing email, and to rewrite addresses so they conform to organisational
&gt; standards.  I've also used them to ensure that intrinsically insecure
&gt; protocols, such as telnet or ftp, are not used; that stops passwords
&gt; being sent in the clear.
