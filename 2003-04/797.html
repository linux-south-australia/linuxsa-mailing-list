Hey Jason,

Truly amazing. You've definitely got the right stuff.
With talent like this, I don't think you'll have any problems in finding
work in the very near future.

Scene 3 was the one that did it for me, nice work.

I recommend anyone to check this out.


Regards,
Rick

PS-&gt; When will the xmms visualisation be released ? ;)

&gt; Hello all,

&gt; I've just completed a small OpenGL demoy thing
&gt; program that displays alot of pretty graphics and
&gt; animations. Have a look if you like. It's been
&gt; developed on a MD 9.0 machine. You'll need a 3D
&gt; accelerated graphics card, and OpenGL.
&gt; 
&gt; (NB/ it's about 1.6 Mb in size).

&gt; The Small Precludes Demo - By Jason Nunn, (C) 2000
&gt; --------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; This started out as being a small project in July
&gt; 2000 to learn OpenGL. I had just quit my job at
&gt; the time (Hallmark Computer Intl), and was a bit
&gt; bored. OpenGL was a passing curiousity. It also
&gt; jeered up the time I wrote demos in the early 90's
&gt; ! ;).
&gt; 
&gt; When I started coding the small scenes, I went to
&gt; pieces a bit, and the whole thing dragged on till
&gt; about Feb 2001 (I only intended to play with it
&gt; for a month ! -- I was also interrupted by other
&gt; projects). I eventually became too busy with
&gt; projects within my new job. Small Precludes
&gt; consequently got shelved... which was a pity,
&gt; because at that point, it was virtually finished,
&gt; and basically needed to be bolted together.
&gt; 
&gt; A couple of weeks ago (April Fools Day, 2003), I
&gt; got retrenched from my current job (Arafura
&gt; Connect). So, I'm unemployed again, with no
&gt; projects to invent or code. So, off the shelf it
&gt; came ! ;). I'm a finisher, and that's what I
&gt; intended to do with Small Precludes-- Even if only
&gt; a handful of people get to see it (and appreciate
&gt; it).
&gt; 
&gt; I used to write demos back in my early 20's and
&gt; late teens. Some of you (but I doubt any of you)
&gt; will remember me from the Hornet demo group and
&gt; the Hornet demo news letters in the mid 90's ?.
&gt; 
&gt; This demo is pathetic compared with even old
&gt; demos, although some of it looks nice... But I'm
&gt; rusty, and it was only a personal learning
&gt; exercise anyway. When it comes to graphics and
&gt; music, I have none these skills (I never did, I
&gt; was simply more patient back then and people had a
&gt; much more tolerant standard ;). I guess the demo
&gt; maker of today comes in the form of a web
&gt; developer ?..
&gt; 
&gt; ..Anyway, I hope you enjoy this archaic and
&gt; obsolete form of electronic entertainment, for all
&gt; it's worth. If you like it, write me a line ;).
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you.
