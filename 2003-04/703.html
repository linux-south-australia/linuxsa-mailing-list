The problem with qmail is that it has deficient functionality.
So there are a host of patches, some better than others.  But
because they are patches their security isn't reviewed.

So you end up with a major bug in qmail's STARTTLS processing,
but qmail's author stating that it's not qmail's problem, as
that processing is done in a patch not in the code he wrote.

Which is a somewhat understandable attitude by the author.
But isn't at all acceptable if you are a system administrator
trying to field a secure e-mail system.


Postfix looks better, but it also has a host of patches
which need to be applied to get a real e-mail system (TLS, LDAP,
quotas).  But unlike the case with Qmail the Postfix patches are
slowly becoming part of the Postfix code base.  The configuration
is easy.


Sendmail supports everything with no patches -- TLS, LDAP, quotas,
milter, RBLs, IPv6.  It will also deliver to Maildir++ mailboxes
(using procmail or maildrop) which you shouldl do, as this
lets you change mail systems without effecting users.  Sendmail's
security model isn't good and it's handling of undeliverable mail
makes it a poor choice for doing mailing lists.  The initial
configuration is hard and is often got terribly wrong.


You tend to see qmail and postfix in ISPs and sendmail
in enterprises, as you'd expect from the feature sets.
