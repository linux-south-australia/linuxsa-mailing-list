&gt; &gt; &gt;Linux itself is a clone of an operating system that is 20-plus years 
&gt; &gt; &gt;old. That's what it is. That is what you can get today, a clone of a 
&gt; &gt; &gt;20-year-old system. I'm not saying that it doesn't have some place for 
&gt; &gt; &gt;some customers, but that is not an innovative proposition.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the portion I most disliked reading.  The architecture of the
&gt; system may be 20 odd years old, but the technology powering it is not.
&gt; This remark is clearly just not true.
&gt; 
&gt; You could say Windows, while evolving from MS-DOS to Windows 98 to Windows
&gt; NT, was up to type 3 of it's kernel, but they still base their systems
&gt; around the idea of having C-Drives and unstructured file systems.  They've
&gt; changed their architecture because the software they've produced in the
&gt; past has been shit.  
&gt; 
&gt; The so-called clone still looks and feels the same because it was based on
&gt; a model that has proven to work well, and that other operating systems
&gt; have also based themselves upon.  The statement is a total crock.

Akk of this rhetoric obscures the fact that there are one or two 
interesting features of NT that would be nice to have under UNIX. 

I am thinking of real ACLs and a hierarchical UID space (SIDs are two 
level but somewhat over architected) and they allow you to easily 
distinguish between anonymous users, guest users, and users from different 
domains.
