Yeah, that's one of the issues that has brought me to a halt on 
planning a VPN setup. For every VPN and non-routing arrangement I can 
think of, I can think of ways of hacking past those configurations - 
especially from the inside. I'm stirring things around in my brain from 
time to time, but no lightbulbs are going off other than users having 
to use virtual machines to connect to the Net, but the chances of 
enforcing that are almost precisely zero.

The most solid setup I can think of at present are single purpose 
machines with no other open ports, coupled with physically detached 
backup machines for validation and restoring to CVS baselines. That 
renders VPN and firewalls almost not worth the effort, other than as a 
mechanism for enforcing policy.

I'm giving it a bit more time in case I have any bright ideas, but 
that's about as far as I've gotten. Defending against internal attacks 
is a lot harder than blocking off outside hackers!
