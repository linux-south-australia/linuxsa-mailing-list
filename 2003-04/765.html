Hello all,

I've just completed a small OpenGL demoy thing
program that displays alot of pretty graphics and
animations. Have a look if you like. It's been
developed on a MD 9.0 machine. You'll need a 3D
accelerated graphics card, and OpenGL.

(NB/ it's about 1.6 Mb in size).

or

Give this link to anyone who has a modern linux
box and hardware ;). Following is the synopsis of
the README.

See ya

The Small Precludes Demo - By Jason Nunn, (C) 2000
--------------------------------------------------

Hello,

This started out as being a small project in July
2000 to learn OpenGL. I had just quit my job at
the time (Hallmark Computer Intl), and was a bit
bored. OpenGL was a passing curiousity. It also
jeered up the time I wrote demos in the early 90's
! ;).

When I started coding the small scenes, I went to
pieces a bit, and the whole thing dragged on till
about Feb 2001 (I only intended to play with it
for a month ! -- I was also interrupted by other
projects). I eventually became too busy with
projects within my new job. Small Precludes
consequently got shelved... which was a pity,
because at that point, it was virtually finished,
and basically needed to be bolted together.

A couple of weeks ago (April Fools Day, 2003), I
got retrenched from my current job (Arafura
Connect). So, I'm unemployed again, with no
projects to invent or code. So, off the shelf it
came ! ;). I'm a finisher, and that's what I
intended to do with Small Precludes-- Even if only
a handful of people get to see it (and appreciate
it).

I used to write demos back in my early 20's and
late teens. Some of you (but I doubt any of you)
will remember me from the Hornet demo group and
the Hornet demo news letters in the mid 90's ?.

This demo is pathetic compared with even old
demos, although some of it looks nice... But I'm
rusty, and it was only a personal learning
exercise anyway. When it comes to graphics and
music, I have none these skills (I never did, I
was simply more patient back then and people had a
much more tolerant standard ;). I guess the demo
maker of today comes in the form of a web
developer ?..

..Anyway, I hope you enjoy this archaic and
obsolete form of electronic entertainment, for all
it's worth. If you like it, write me a line ;).

Thank you.
