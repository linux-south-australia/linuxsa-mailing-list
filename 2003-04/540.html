Short answer: Needs libc5 (shlibs5) in SuSE 8.1. Reinstall if necessary.

Just a short follow up on The Andrew Word Processor and some information 
for anyone wanting to use Word Perfect 8:

I am not working today, recouping from taxation. So I decided that I 
wanted to do a number of things that I was unable to get to before.

I had recently gone to the local used book store and found the full 
version of Word Perfect 8 there, so I bought it. I already owned the 
download version, but I wanted to try the full version, along with some 
book in French by Steve Bourne. Le Systeme Unix. I don't have the book 
any longer, but I still have WordPerfect 8.

Anyway, when I went to install Word Perfect 8, from the provided CD, I 
got a ton of errors, so I gave up on that, and decided to install the 
download version of Word Perfect 8, of which I already had a full set of 
instructions for that I had tested and installed 8 - 10 times.

I also could no longer run The Andrew Consortium's EZ Word Processor, 
but noticed that it would have the same error as Word Perfect 8, "No 
such file or directory."

Here is a description of the symptoms as posted by another user: 
 <A HREF="http://clue.denver.co.us/pipermail/clue-cert/2001-April/000277.html">http://clue.denver.co.us/pipermail/clue-cert/2001-April/000277.html</A>
 
I had never got around to installing the download edition of Word 
Perfect 8 again on my own desk, and somewhere down the line, I had to 
rescue my own system by doing an upgrade install of SuSE Linux. To muddy 
up the water some more, I also had recently upgraded to KDE 3.1.

So, when I went to setup the download edition of Word Perfect 8 , I saw 
that it behaved as it did when I did not have shlibs5 (libc5) installed. 
 I also googled around and saw many references to libc5, but I was sure 
I had already installed shlibs5 on my system.  I looked in the Yast2 
control center, to see if shlibs5 was installed, and sure enough, it 
showed up as installed there.

So on a whim, I decided to uninstall shlibs5 and then reinstall it.

And whadda ya know....

....the both of the applications worked.

Now I have to see if what ever broke shlibs5, is now broken.
