&gt; Well, it's going to be easy to spot Chris' house then - it's the one with
&gt; red tinting on all the glass and sitting inside a Faraday cage.

It's called "Tempest" and it's not as easy as you might think... you
have to do it at the level of the machines and their cabling, not just
the building.

Some guys were building a Faraday cage to tempest a government
security facility, with their portable radio playing as builders do...
finished the job, one of them picked up the radio and said "This
shouldn't be working, should it?" - but it was.

IR is easier - ordinary glass doesn't transmit infra-red very well so
you can just put thicker glass in. That'll stop stray signals from IR
transmitters inside getting out, but it doesn't stop someone with a
sufficiently powerful transmitter getting in.
