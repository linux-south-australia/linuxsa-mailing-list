&gt; These sound like fighting words. Is there any truth to what Ballmer says?

&gt; &gt;Linux itself is a clone of an operating system that is 20-plus years 
&gt; &gt;old. That's what it is. That is what you can get today, a clone of a 
&gt; &gt;20-year-old system. I'm not saying that it doesn't have some place for 
&gt; &gt;some customers, but that is not an innovative proposition.

This is the portion I most disliked reading.  The architecture of the
system may be 20 odd years old, but the technology powering it is not.
This remark is clearly just not true.

You could say Windows, while evolving from MS-DOS to Windows 98 to Windows
NT, was up to type 3 of it's kernel, but they still base their systems
around the idea of having C-Drives and unstructured file systems.  They've
changed their architecture because the software they've produced in the
past has been shit.  

The so-called clone still looks and feels the same because it was based on
a model that has proven to work well, and that other operating systems
have also based themselves upon.  The statement is a total crock.

&gt; &gt;Some people say it is an advantage that Linux gets built in all of 
&gt; &gt;these little pieces. The fact is that if you want to do some kind of 
&gt; &gt;integrated innovation that touches the kernel, that touches the user 
&gt; &gt;interface--there is no way. Maybe Linus (Torvalds) can control the 
&gt; &gt;innovation in the piece called the kernel, but there are many pieces.

So run BSD :-)
