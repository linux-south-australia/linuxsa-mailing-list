Hi, from memory the short answer is:

su postgres
OR
su postgresql
or su whatever the postgres user account is on your system.

You need to log on as the postgres user account. Below are some links, 
which I searched for briefly which mention changing to the postgres user 
in order to run postgres administration commands. I think pgsql will 
work from then on. The docs are annoying in not mentioning this step 
explicitly. A person wouldn't read these docs below if using a distros 
version of postgres rather than installing from source.

Oh, and I used to forget to not be in roots home directory when doing this.

Cheers, Stephen.

&gt; Just wondering if anyone can help me out here. I am trying to get my 
&gt; version of Postgresql working on Mandrake 9.0. I am sure this is a 
&gt; stupid question and everybody is going to have any easy answer to it, 
&gt; but how do I log on to the dam thing. I mean, I know its running cause 
&gt; I can see its status in the Mandrake Control Centre. I downloaded 
&gt; phpPgAdmin so that I could do basic administration on the server, but 
&gt; I don't know what user name to log on to the server with. I can't find 
&gt; anywhere in the documentation what user is set up by default on the 
&gt; server once it is installed. Having experience with MySQL, I assumed 
&gt; that root with no assword should do the trick, but it didn't. I have 
&gt; also tried pgsql with no password and tried using the command 
&gt; createuser in the shell prompt, but non of this works. Help from 
&gt; anyone would much apreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt; Reece
