&gt;I'm going to make the charitable assumption that the reason you've 
&gt;neglected the way that the Japanese occupied PNG, bombed Darwin, and
&gt;sent submarines into Sydney Harbor in World War II was because nobody
&gt;bothered to tell you, rather than because you've forgotten (which is,
&gt;after all, one of the things that Anzac Day is specifically intended
&gt;to avoid...)
&gt;
&gt;Consider yourself educated.  You're welcome.

I am aware of the things that happened in W.W.II and as I said in an 
earlier post it would be the most likely contender for a war in the 
defense our freedom.  

But consider why and how we became involved in that war. Australian 
troops first fired on the Japanese (and conducted themselves admirably 
*) in the Malay campaign which ultimately lead to the fall of Singapore.

Why Singapore? Because we were defending the bastion of the British 
Empire, not freedom. The Pacific war was largely over Vietnam, the Malay 
peninsula, and the resources contained within. Largely a colonial 
territory of France, which Great Britain eagerly saw handed back to them 
at the termination of hostilities in 1945. In fact after the war they 
armed Japanese soldiers to crush the freedom seeking Vietnamese 
resistance, which had been a help up until then in fighting the Japanese.

The jews were liberated in Europe, but that was very much a byproduct 
and not a goal of the war, Eastern Europe was occupied and controlled by 
the Soviet Union, West Germany partitioned into French, English and 
American zones. Africa was very much still controlled by Europe, no more 
freedom won there.

We managed to hang onto PNG by fighting a horrific war of attrition down 
the Kokoda trail. The men who fought on that trail were nothing short of 
amazing, as were the natives who supported them. So what ever did happen 
to them? The  Dutch rulers returned to Indonesia with help, as with the 
Portuguese  colonists to East Timor. Australia continued it's mandate of 
PNG awarded in 1920.

The second world war was a war of stagnated economies, third world 
resources and empire, that it got close to a fight for our survival 
shows how much the Japanese were  underestimated. It certainly didn't 
start as a war for survival. The Japanese didn't simply wake up one 
morning and decide to take out Broome.

All the freedoms and rights we ever won we won them in peace, some in 
1901. More were handed down to us in common law. We've fought in 8 major 
conflicts, and we've been threatened once.

What does all this mean? Should we not have ANZAC day? We should 
definitely have ANZAC day, we must remember those who fell, their mates 
who returned and the families torn apart. But please don't start 
thinking that our free nation was borne out of conflict and has only 
survived through our continual participation in wars not of our making 
nor of our benefit. And don't make the same mistake that W.W.II was a 
war of liberation for all. After all, there were probably fewer free 
countries after the war than before.



*If you ever get a chance read "Staff Officer Walah" the diaries of a 
digger in the Malay - Singapore campaign.

If you are interested in continuing this debate perhaps we should take 
it off-line...
