****Cross Over Office 2.0****

The other night, I downloaded the beta version of the new Cross Over
Office 2.   In short, its a very nice product, well worth the cost.

On top of supporting Quicken and MS Office, they now claim to support
Adobe Photoshop 7. Unmentioned is Quickbooks Pro 2000 and Macromedia
Dreamweaver and Framemaker, which I have used in the past.  I have also
noted that the installation of Crossover is less buggy, and the
performance of the applications that I use, were almost just as good as
if they were running native in Windows.

Furthermore, MS Access was not viable in Linux for our company, but it
now is, if I can verify a working mail merge function. The list of most
wanted Linux replacements for Windows applications grows smaller, while
the list of possible replacements grows larger.

I will be testing a number of things when I get back, including this
list of renegade applications. This is their status as I know now. #
means I need to test Cxoffice 2.0, this was the 1.31 status.

1. CPA Software - a time and billing program [4]* #
2. Depreciation solution [5] #
3. Prosystem fx - Tax preparation [6]*
4. MAS 90 - company accounting [7] #
5. Win571L - property tax forms [8] #
6. PPC - Audit programs. [1] #
7. Accupay Payroll #
8. Caseware 2001 [2] #
9. Lacerte Income Tax Preparation [3] #


[1] Previous limited sucess with WineX 2.1
[2] Caseware 2000 is 98% functional in CX office 1.31
[3] Lacerte will install and work on the return can be performed,
however it cannot be printed and REP access cannot be obtained in CX
office 1.31
[4] Timesheet php was a candidate for replacement, but was not intuitive
or comprehensive enough.
[5] Will install, but has a date problem. Yes, we have spreadsheets in
windows. People forget formulas. Mysql is a candidate, but I have to
think it over more.
[6] Dies after installation screen comes up
[7] Installs but won't run
[8] An on-line or Adobe solution seems so close, but so far away...

* I am guessing these are Foxpro applications, and these seem to have
not been implimented much in Wine.

Here is a review:

****Winex3****

I will note that America On Line 5 does not crash anymore when one
attempts to view a web link. Instead a blank Window comes up. I cannot
get Internet Explorer to install in Winex3, but that would solve the
problem.

P.S. I just received SuSE 8.2, and started the upgrade process here. I
have a lot to write about on that. However, I have to prepare a tax
return so I can head out of town.
