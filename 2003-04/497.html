&gt;&gt; Perhaps you've mentioned this in earlier posts, (since I'm new here),
&gt;&gt; but I'm curious as to why you think "firewalls are mostly useless"?
&gt; 
&gt; I tend to agree with Stephen about firewalls.  I have a couple of
&gt; issues with firewalls, and perhaps the most important is that you do
&gt; not need one if the machines behind it are secure.  What firewalls

True, but the very nature of security means you can't be sure of that, hence 
you need a firewall. The basic idea of a firewall is to remove the single 
point of failure -- you make it so that to get into your network, a hacker 
needs to get through both a firewall (which is a separate machine of some 
description), and your host security. If you wanted to get really excited, 
you'd have a bastion host, that sits in a DMZ, protected by a firewall on 
each side. You'd also try to have different OS's (and even different 
hardware) running on each, so any bugs in one aren't affected in the other. 
(which is where your other argument falls apart too, :) 

&gt; can do is give you the sense that your local machines don't need to be
&gt; secure because the firewall gives you total security.  That is quite
&gt; wrong.  What firewalls can do is give you a false sense of security.
&gt; They can make you complacent.  False security is worse than no security.
&gt; Firewalls also do get in the way; that's their purpose.  Many people,
&gt; when the firewall gets in the way, simply poke a hole through it without
&gt; really thinking about the ramifications.  Perhaps they find they can't
&gt; send mail from their favoured email client, so they open up the SMTP port.
&gt; Lookout!  Who knows what buffer overflow is there to be exploited.

Yes, true. There is no magic "firewall" thing that you can enable or add to 
your network to make it secure. 

&gt; 
&gt; I think there is no substitute for locking down each and every machine.
&gt; And if each machine is locked down, a firewall really adds very little.
&gt; It presents, perhaps, an additional obstacle for the hacker to circumvent,
&gt; but as I already said, that comes at the cost of an obstacle to the
&gt; people it is supposed to protect.

That obstacle could be critical, particularly if your machine runs software 
with exploitable holes. 

&gt; 
&gt; One thing that a firewall can do quite well is enforce certain global
&gt; security policies on a network.  I've used them to ensure that all email
&gt; goes through a central email host; which can be used to log incoming and
&gt; outgoing email, and to rewrite addresses so they conform to organisational
&gt; standards.  I've also used them to ensure that intrinsically insecure
&gt; protocols, such as telnet or ftp, are not used; that stops passwords
&gt; being sent in the clear.

Another lesser known thing about firewalls is that they are not merely 
packet filters. A packet filter (eg iptables) is just a part of a 
firewall...
