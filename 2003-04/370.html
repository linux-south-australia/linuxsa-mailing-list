&gt;&gt;Don't be silly - the "Genetic Diversity" argument against a single
&gt;&gt;platform is well established;  Would you have our entire global 
&gt;&gt;Internet infrastructure go up in a puff of smoke next time someone
&gt;&gt;managed to find an exploit for your "one platform"?
&gt; 
&gt; If there were one platform then our effort at making it secure and robust
&gt; would be a lot more effective.

But you're missing the point.  "A lot more effective" isn't good enough;
The resulting coordinated efforts would have to be 100% effective,
otherwise it's inevitable that an attack will be mounted which will wipe
out the entire infrastructure.

Have a think about the profound nature of that situation for a minute
before you reply.  Do you really want to place yourself into a situation
where one mistake by one programmer somewhere in the world can result
in massive, coordinated failure of EVERYTHING?  Is it good engineering
practice to RELY on the assumption that all of your inputs are 100%
perfect?

&gt; I claim that Microsoft and Intel, by giving us a common
&gt; platform, have done more to drive down the price and beef up the features
&gt; of computing than any other organisation before. 

I claim that I don't give a rat's arse, and that your claim is
irrelevent in the current context.

&gt; So it's not perfect. Name one platform that is.

That's the entire point -- there are no perfect platforms, so it is
absolutely and uncompromisingly vital that NONE of these imperfect
platforms become the one-and-only alternative.

None of this is rocket science.

I'm pretty certain that there's a large amount of devils' advocacy
in your posts in this thread.  Like Richard Russell, I'm intrigued
to know where you think you're going with this :-)
