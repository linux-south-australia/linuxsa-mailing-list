+--------+------------------------------

* 1. Linux Gaming to the Extreme by Brett Lymns

Is the last bastion of the Win32 platform crumbling?  Some people hate
them, others love them - regardless of what side of the fence you are
one there is no arguing that computer gaming is a big business.  A
business that in the PC arena has been fairly much tied up by the
Microsoft operating systems.  This is starting to change, this talk
will be a mixture of where the change came from and how things are
changing with a bit of personal experience about how I get my gaming
fix.  There is an alternative, come and find out more see a demo and
maybe even get hooked.

Brett Lymn by day is a Solaris admin (well, that and "other duties"
;-)  for a multinational company, by night a NetBSD hacker and PC
gaming addict. Come hear how he uses Linux to game to the extreme.

* 2. SA-AUUG Chapter Elections

Out with the old, in with the new. Once again SA-AUUG will be holding
its yearly chapter elections. All are encouraged to attend and vote
in a new committee and nominate who they want. Nominations can be
sent to <A HREF="mailto:sa-auug@auug.org.au">sa-auug@auug.org.au</A> or given on the day with the positions
available being:
     - Chairperson
     - Treasurer
     - Secretary
     - General Committee member (x2)

All are welcome to nominate but only SA-AUUG members can vote and
assume a position on the committee.

* 3. Welcoming in the new committee

As with any election the new committee members will be formally
welcomed to the ranks of SA-AUUG and a transfer of knowledge will
take place to indicate the way things are.

----------------------------------------
At the conclusion of the meeting many members of the group continue
to talk as they wine and dine at one of the fine local restaurant
establishments to which all are invited.

Hope to see you there.

    Regards,
      SA-AUUG Secretary

PS: My sincere apologies for the extra two messages. Mozilla and
     me aren't on talking terms due to it.
