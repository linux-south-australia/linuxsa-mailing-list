Do you mean it's not even getting through the BIOS initialisation
screen?

Have you recently put more drives in it? Maybe your PSU can't cope
anymore; try it with a bigger one.

If that's not it, try seeing if you can gain any control over when it
stops working: unscrew the PSU from the case, but leave all the wires
plugged in, and see if the boot stops when you shake the PSU, or whack
it with a screwdriver handle. If so, there's a dodgy connection in the
PSU. This isn't very likely though, so sterner methods will be needed.

Take out everything, so all you are left with is motherboard, CPU,
memory and video card (unless it's got onboard video). If it works now
(obviously it won't boot any OS cos there are no drives in it, but if
it gets as far as finding this out) plug stuff back in one item at a
time, testing it after each item. When it stops working, you've found
the dodgy bit.

If the nearly-naked system doesn't work, swap the memory, CPU and
video card for known good items, again one at a time. Start with the
memory because that's usually the most likely bit to have gone wrong.

If it still doesn't work with known good memory, CPU and video, you've
eliminated everything else so it's got to be the motherboard. You may
just be able to avoid buying a new one by putting the entire machine
back together and leaving it in a pigeon loft with some corn on its
lid, to see if it acquires a lucky pigeon turd.

I once was repairing a VCR which was acting very like your computer
and I could NOT find what was wrong with it. So I put it back together
still not working and went to bed. When I came back to it the next day
it was exactly as I had left it except that one of my pigeons had shat
squarely in the middle of the lid. I plugged it in and it worked
straight away.

Later I was repairing a CD-ROM drive for a friend who knew of this
story. I returned the drive to him with a pigeon turd taped to the
casing, labelled "Lucky Pigeon Turd - Warranty Void If Removed". He
later found that if the drive was having trouble on a CD he was able
to sort it out by giving the lucky pigeon turd a rub, Aladdin's-lamp
style.
