'The Cuckoo's Egg' by Clifford Stoll was/is an interesting factual 
account about this sort of thing (or so I thought).

See <A HREF="http://mostlyfiction.com/adventure/stoll.htm">http://mostlyfiction.com/adventure/stoll.htm</A>

IMHO, the obvious down side of honey-pots is the more the black 
hats 'like' your site the greater the chance (unless correctly setup) 
they have of getting into the real network by accident.

Subject: Honeypots get stickier??

&gt; OK, experts. What's the info about honeyposts. Are they
&gt; worthwhile setting up? Are they a nuisance? Is there a
&gt; situation where they can mask genuine threats to the
&gt; network? Should we bother about them?

&gt; Honeypots get stickier for hackers
&gt; By Robert Lemos 
&gt; Staff Writer, CNET News.com

&gt; 
&gt; VANCOUVER, British Columbia--If Lance Spitzner has his way,
&gt; network defenders will get sweeter on the "honeypot"--a
&gt; traditional method of detecting online intruders. 
&gt; 
&gt; Spitzner and two dozen members of the Honeynet Project hope
&gt; new changes to the group's open-source honeypot technology
&gt; will help the method become much more popular among security
&gt; companies and others. The technology is designed to help
&gt; users forge their own honeypots--faked computers and
&gt; networks that serve as decoys for discovering online
&gt; miscreants. 
&gt; 
&gt; The changes, to be outlined in a paper that will be
&gt; published online Monday, were described in a speech Spitzner
&gt; gave here at the CanSecWest security show. The new features
&gt; will help honeypots become harder for intruders to detect
&gt; and easier to deploy for companies and even home users. 
&gt; 
&gt; "It's an arms race," said Spitzner, founder of the Honeynet
&gt; Project. "We are coming up with new stuff, and the bad guys
&gt; will look at it. We are staying ahead of 99 percent of the
&gt; crowd." 
&gt; 
&gt; Honeypots solve a major problem of intrusion-detection
&gt; systems, which frequently flag innocuous network traffic as
&gt; a potential attack. These "false positives," as they're
&gt; called, make the systems difficult to manage. They also
&gt; create a "crying wolf" situation, in which genuine threats
&gt; can be overlooked. 
&gt; 
&gt; Honeypots can solve the problem because they only detect
&gt; data sent to a specific server--one that, because it's fake,
&gt; shouldn't have any data sent to it at all.
