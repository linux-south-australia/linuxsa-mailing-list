&gt; No real reason, apart form I've heard grumbles about the config on
qmail and it's owner. not heard of vpopmail before.

Its EASY to configure.. I can send you a howto if you like (email me off
list). I can also show you our qmailadmin if you want a look at the web
front end :)

Qmail is also faster than Postfix/Sendmail I believe :)

&gt; &gt; vpopmail stores its users in a custom file database & therefore does

&gt; &gt; not require a unix user for each mail account (better security
IMHO).

&gt; That's a nice feature, I generally manage the shells to /bin/false for
the same effect. I was thinking to use qpopper
&gt; and uw-imapd.

Vpopmail does its own POP3 as well if you need it. Also talks to Courier
IMAP.

Oh and with this setup, you can deliver to Maildir if you want too -
much better mail storage format!

&gt; &gt; You can then stick one of the nice web-interfaces on it (eg
qmailadmin 
&gt; &gt; from www.inter7.com), and administrate it all from web pages (or
even 
&gt; &gt; better, make someone else administrate it ;) ).

&gt; sounds good, but in my experience, the only maintenance is
adding/deleting users once the whole shebang is up
&gt; and running.

That's what the web interface allows you to do :) (add users / delete /
create mailing lists / aliases / forwards etc) - no more editing text
files :)

&gt; I don't believe that qmail has had any major (if any) security issues 
&gt; in the past (but I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong).
&gt; 
&gt; I have done what you are describing before with this kind of setup.

&gt; Thanks. I'll add your suggestions to my list of things to check out.
I'm down the track with postfix now, I don't feel 
&gt; like jumping onto another ship unless there is a very good reason, but
I'll check out vpopmail. Do you know if it's GPL?

Yup. There are lots of other nice bits on www.inter7.com too which are
also GPL.

I strongly suggest you at least have a look at it before you commit
yourself to something else :)
