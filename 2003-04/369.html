&gt; &gt; Will Linux become the OS standard?
&gt; 
&gt; Of course not.

Yes, and that is so obvious that David doesn't even need to state a
reason... :) (I assume it's because David's platform of choice will
become the standard in Utopia, coming shortly on rebel.net.au...)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What will that mean for Microsoft, Windows, and Office?
&gt; 
&gt; Who cares?  Perhaps Office would be made available under 
&gt; Linux.  I still wouldn't be able to run it on my platform of choice.

Evidently, David doesn't care. So who else would? No-one of course. MS,
Windows, and Office, despite giving us a common platform, are not things
to care about, and nor do they run on David's platform of choice (which,
I guess, isn't the common platform, which would make the common platform
not common in this case ... uncommon, on this list, most likely...)

&gt; 
&gt; If you think you can satisfy your computing needs without 
&gt; recourse to proprietary software then you just aren't 
&gt; expecting enough from your computers.  Somebody, somewhere, 
&gt; has an application that you'd find quite useful, and you can 
&gt; only get it on their choice of platforms.

I guess yet-to-be-discovered applications that David would "find quite
useful" are hidden "computing needs" that he has. What if my computing
needs happen to include the condition that the software is open source,
or runs on my choice of platform? Serious question -- I don't want two
laptops so I can run a "quite useful" OSX program as well as a "quite
useful" windows program... I don't want to bet my business (or ...
say... my national security) on a piece of software controlled entirely
by an overseas corporation...

&gt; 
&gt; Until everybody agrees on a common platform, which means 
&gt; compatible hardware and operating system, there will always 
&gt; be the haves and the have-nots.  Windows is closer to that 
&gt; common platform than anything else available today.

What about Java?

Does that mean that we should agree to all use Windows, seeing as it's a
common platform, with common hardware?

David, I'm not sure quite where you're trying to go with this thread,
but I'm keen to find out :)
