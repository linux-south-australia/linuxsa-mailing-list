&gt; I would also argue against the use of lock-ins to back up this method.
&gt; If you're trying to trick someone out of some money, and they see
&gt; through the trick, do you really try and carry on with the trick, or
&gt; do you just swear quietly and put up with whatever losses you have
&gt; incurred trying to set the trick up?

Inkjet prices are artificially deflated and you pay the difference through
inflated cartridge costs.  But looking at Playstation, GameCube and XBox
software one really can't see any inflation.  Most first release PC titles
are between $90 and $100 while console games are released in the same price
bracket.

Users would have a right to complain if, say PC games cost $90 while
comparable titles were released at $120 or so on consoles.  Would console
titles be cheaper without licensing?  Maybe... however this isn't the case
on the PC where anyone can publish anything.

The major losers in the console pricing schemes are the actual game
manufacturers who are often locked into a platform and must pay high license
fees.

See ya
