&gt; everyone will realize what happened but that won't stop them opening the
&gt; next 'Hey there, check out this screen saver' when it comes around.
&gt; managment suddenly realize their computer people are idiots for not running
&gt; anti-virus....    that's my 2 bobs worth...

My two bobs worth is that you need to run a virus checker
on e-mail, even in a all-Linux shop.

I've unfortunately forwarded a virus-infected e-mail to
a 5000-people mailing list.  Ironically if I was running
Windows that probably wouldn't have happened :-(

Similarly, you need to virus scan the web site if it contains
any Word or PDF documents.

Since some staff use Windows machines, we also scan
the SMB/NFS/WebDAV corporate filesystems.

At least then if someone's Windows machine is infected, the
Linux systems aren't the vector for its further spread.

Running a virus scanner on the Windows clients, although
a very good idea, doesn't quite cut it as you can't reach
all the machines that might ever use your e-mail or update
your web site (eg: a contracted website HTML coder).



What annoys me is the shoddy performance of the e-mail
virus scanners.  Almost all computer science courses
teach state machines.  Anyone can write a program to
merge the state machines for MIME, dearchiving, decompression
and virus scanning.  That merge would allow a single-pass
virus scan of e-mail with no disk I/O (ie: scan the mail
as you read it from the SMTP session).

People are buying seriously-specced machines to do
e-mail virus scanning, something which needn't be
a heavy-weight task.
