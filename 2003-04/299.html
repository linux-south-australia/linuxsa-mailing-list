An interesting side effect of the MS lawsuit against Lindows.

Cheers,  Ian

A Legal Victory: We Got Our Slingshot 

Nearly everyone has heard about our litigation with Microsoft, which 
goes to a jury in December, 2003 in Seattle. (Microsoft sued us 
claiming they are the only company that can use the word "windows," 
despite the fact that it has been generically used throughout the 
industry since long before Microsoft adopted it.) What you haven't 
heard about is that for quite some time, Lindows.com has been involved 
in yet another critical legal battle.

After Microsoft filed its trademark infringement complaint, Lindows.com 
informed our business insurance provider and asked them to help defend 
us - which is their obligation under the policy we purchased. St. Paul 
Fire and Marine Insurance Company (NYSE: SPC) refused to defend us in 
spite of the fact that they willingly took our premiums and knew our 
company name and business plan from the outset. Worse yet, St. Paul 
almost immediately filed their own lawsuit against Lindows.com. Now, 
not only must Lindows.com defend itself against the richest company on 
the planet, but we had to spend money hiring even more attorneys to 
defend a lawsuit against someone who is supposed to be on our side! 
This is not how insurance is supposed to work. 

Of course nobody wants to pay for a legal battle with Microsoft, a 
company known for protracted litigation, but St. Paul's refusal to 
defend us is dangerous for our small company because it leaves us to 
bear completely the financial burden of a lawsuit which is now well 
into seven digits--it's like David trying to fight Goliath without a 
slingshot. This has required us to spend time and money on attorneys 
that would have been much better spent on improving our product and 
company. Even more disconcerting, we have learned that St. Paul has had 
marketing and business ties to Microsoft in the past. Perhaps this 
explains St. Paul's immediate refusal to defend us and their tactic of 
suing their own customer. Time may reveal the truth since Lindows.com 
has been forced to file a "bad faith" claim against St. Paul to try to 
get to the bottom of this situation. 

In the meantime, Judge Robert Takasugi has just entered summary 
judgment in favor of Lindows.com. He found in his ruling that St. Paul 
is liable for breaching their contract and confirmed that they have a 
duty to defend Lindows.com. This is an important legal victory for 
Lindows.com because it offers some relief in the financial impact of a 
lawsuit by a massive corporation like Microsoft. It's still a David vs. 
Goliath fight, but at least we get to use our slingshot.
