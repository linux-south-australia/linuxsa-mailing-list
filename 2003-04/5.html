From: "Kim Hawtin" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:kim@freesolutions.net">kim@freesolutions.net</A>&gt;
&gt; i had a similar problem on my Toshiba 7200s. I ran one with '98 and the
&gt; other with 2000. Installed as per recovery cd. Both systems had IBM 12GB
&gt; hdds, but only the 200 systems spun the disk down, very "intermitantly",
&gt; even on AC power.  I swaped the disk over to my NEC laptop and never had
&gt; the same problem.  The 10GB IBM disk i bought to replace it never did
&gt; this.
&gt;
&gt; however, i only ran Linux 2.2 and 2.4 based distros on the 7200 after
&gt; the swap. as 2000 no longer suited my purposes.  win98 did not do this,
&gt; on the same hardware, nor did any version of linux or freebsd i put on
&gt; the 7200. i can only point the finger at win 2000 + 7200.

Thanks for your email.  Interesting.

Simon @ BMS Tech contacted me again and said he has got another Toshiba
Satellite 1110 on his desk which has the same 'fault' as mine.  This issue
looks much more like a bug involving some interaction between NT-based
Windows and the laptop's hardware.  Still, all the possible software
settings have been tweaked and replacement hardware has been ruled out as
the problem will persist.  Toshiba are now trying to work something out and
will contact me with a solution.  I bet they will either offer a refund or
sight the EULA that states bugs and design faults are not covered under
warranties...

Waiting patiently...
