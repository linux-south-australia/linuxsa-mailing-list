&gt; Hi Daniel,
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; An XBox is really very similar to a PC. It is a piece of hardware that
&gt;  &gt; runs software. Why do you think there should be any difference ethically
&gt;  &gt; in what you are allowed to run on it?
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; And on the subsidisation issue, do you think the price of Windows would
&gt;  &gt; be so affordable[1] if they didn't plan on being able to make most of
&gt;  &gt; their money with Office and server products such as Exchange and MS SQL?
&gt; 
&gt; Regardless of technically commonality bewteen the XBox to a PC, it is 
&gt; marketed and sold as a "gaming console" to a different market. As a 
&gt; result, the XBox is subsidised and the company make their profits from 
&gt; the XBox-licensed software being sold.
&gt; 
&gt; Unless you have a source to says otherwise, I don't think that Windows 
&gt; is a subsidised product. Last I heard there were actually two profitable 
&gt; products from Microsoft - Windows and Office.

Indeed, there was an SEC filing that they made that showed that Windows 
and Office were the only two profitable products, and their profit margins 
were in the 80s or so.
