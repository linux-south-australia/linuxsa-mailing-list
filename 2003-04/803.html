Hi,

I have recently done an install of IPCop 1.3.0 after suspecting that my 
previous installation of 1.2.0 was cracked although it was fully patched.
I regulaly view my logs on the box and suddenly some records had 
completely disappeared although others were still there, and some 
aspects of the web interface stopped working literally overnight..

I have read the IPCop Addons section on their web site about how to log 
messages on another machine, 
(<A HREF="http://www.ipcop.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/IPCop/IPCopAddons">http://www.ipcop.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/IPCop/IPCopAddons</A>#How_can_I_use_a_different_machin)
but as far as I can see, this stops the normal logging on the IPCop box 
and just logs everything remotely.

I have a Rh 7.3 server connected to the network as well, so what I would 
really like to do is keep logging normally on IPCop, but also log the 
messages to this box in a separate directory so I can just scp them 
together onto one machine and diff them for discrepencies.

Anyone had any experience with doing this to IPCop or Smoothwall?

Thanks,
Nathan Millhouse
