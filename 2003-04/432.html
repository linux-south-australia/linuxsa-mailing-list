Hi

I don't believe there is a 1024 cylinder limit anymore with lilo. This
was only because lilo wasn't updated fast enough when bigger drives came
out.

I usually install Windows first then Linux second and lilo picks up
everything fine. I haven't had a need for grub but I will be looking
into it. I've been using lilo since RH5.2 (when I started with Linux)
and have had no problems that weren't user ones.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Computer cases unless they are of the more expensive sturdy variety
&gt; &gt; don't always like being moved and can make a drive cable loose enough
&gt; &gt; not to work. That doesn't mean it has to be off not to work either.
&gt; 
&gt; this is what i first thought.  i tried reseating all cards, memory etc and 
&gt; also reconnecting the drives in case a cable had been dislodged or whatever.  
&gt; Still the same response.  I tried creating a bootable floppy using mdk's 
&gt; windoze tools but the floppy booted with the same result...
&gt; 
&gt; i once had it display a slightly different error ('unable to mount root fs on 
&gt; 09:06'    - instead of 03:02) but i'm not sure what that means.  I remember 
&gt; reading up on what the numbers meant but i've forgotten now...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Lilo expects partitions to remain in their place ie /boot / /etc etc.
&gt; &gt; Correct me if I'm wrong someone but doesn't the kernel load from the
&gt; &gt; boot sector then it goes looking for partitions part way through
&gt; &gt; loading. If a hard drive isn't there that was before something vital
&gt; &gt; could be missing. Are all your Linux partitions on the one drive?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; yes.  its a 20GB seagate barracuda II (7200rpm) set as master (on the onboard 
&gt; ATA133 controller - ASUS A7V133 M/B with IDE RAID but i'm not using the RAID 
&gt; slots) and a Fujitsu 7200rpm 8.4GB drive set as slave.
&gt; 
&gt; The seagate is my linux drive:
&gt; 250MB swap
&gt; 6GB / (reiserfs)
&gt; 3GB /home (reiserfs)
&gt; 9.7GB (reiserfs) = my own data storage area...
&gt; 
&gt; The fujitsu is my windoze drive, very rarely used.
&gt; 
&gt; The system would boot to the slave drive, which contained XOSL (to allow 
&gt; dual-boot - since the linux bootloader wont start windows because windows is 
&gt; on the slave drive - i blame windows for this, not lilo/grub).
&gt; It would then go to the linux bootloader and continue from there...(if linux 
&gt; was selected on XOSL).
&gt; 
&gt; i tried it without the windows drive connected, so that the only bootloader 
&gt; was lilo, but still the same problem.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you could get that graphical screen off then you could see how far
&gt; &gt; through loading that your machine got.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; the error was where instead of saying 'init version 2.84' (i think that's the 
&gt; version no.) it would say 'kernel panic...etc. etc'.  So obviously its right 
&gt; before the 'init' program was started.  I did try a non-fb bootup to get 
&gt; this...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If lilo.conf had been changed by any of the Mandrake graphical tools did
&gt; &gt; that tool finish off properly by running lilo again after the changes?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; or some automatic script run on shutdown?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; thanks everyone for all the help!
&gt; 
&gt; My system is working again, I'm just clueless as to what caused the problem 
&gt; and I have the feeling that lilo is just too sensitive and fragile.  I first 
&gt; tried to reinstall lilo by reinstalling and choosing the 'update' option.  
&gt; This basically skips package installation and goes through post-install 
&gt; again.  This didn't work so i tried again and selected grub and this fixed 
&gt; everything.
&gt; 
&gt; Another bonus for grub is that you can actually edit your grub config entirely 
&gt; without booting linux at all!  I dont think this is possible with lilo, since 
&gt; lilo needs to be re-run from within linux to save the config.
&gt; 
&gt; cheers,
&gt;
