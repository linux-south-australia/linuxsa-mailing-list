 OK, experts. What's the info about honeyposts. Are they
 worthwhile setting up? Are they a nuisance? Is there a
 situation where they can mask genuine threats to the
 network? Should we bother about them?

Honeypots get stickier for hackers

 VANCOUVER, British Columbia--If Lance Spitzner has his way,
 network defenders will get sweeter on the "honeypot"--a
 traditional method of detecting online intruders. 

 Spitzner and two dozen members of the Honeynet Project hope
 new changes to the group's open-source honeypot technology
 will help the method become much more popular among security
 companies and others. The technology is designed to help
 users forge their own honeypots--faked computers and
 networks that serve as decoys for discovering online
 miscreants. 

 The changes, to be outlined in a paper that will be
 published online Monday, were described in a speech Spitzner
 gave here at the CanSecWest security show. The new features
 will help honeypots become harder for intruders to detect
 and easier to deploy for companies and even home users. 

 "It's an arms race," said Spitzner, founder of the Honeynet
 Project. "We are coming up with new stuff, and the bad guys
 will look at it. We are staying ahead of 99 percent of the
 crowd." 

 Honeypots solve a major problem of intrusion-detection
 systems, which frequently flag innocuous network traffic as
 a potential attack. These "false positives," as they're
 called, make the systems difficult to manage. They also
 create a "crying wolf" situation, in which genuine threats
 can be overlooked. 

 Honeypots can solve the problem because they only detect
 data sent to a specific server--one that, because it's fake,
 shouldn't have any data sent to it at all.
