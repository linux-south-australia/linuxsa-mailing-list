In the Australian recently Harris Technologies (ht.com.au) have been 
advertising "Compaq 800" notebooks for Students spec'ed with: 13.3" 
screen, 256MB memory, XP home, 20GB Hd, C1.5Ghz CPU for $1499 if you're 
a student!

$1499 ain't too far off $799.

&gt;&gt; Toms Hardware had an amusing benchmark a couple of years ago where a
&gt;&gt; Celeron 500 would easily beat a 1Ghz+ VIA C3 in business benchmarks,
&gt;&gt; and the gulf was far wider when it came to anything that uses the
&gt;&gt; FPU.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm, I wouldn't have thought that wouldn't be too much of a problem 
&gt; becuase I assume that the people who need good FP would probably be the 
&gt; same people who tend to buy something top of the line anyway, or at 
&gt; least something with good FP. :) Gamers, tech professionals, scientists, 
&gt; etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Students would love these, I think. I know quite a few who want a low 
&gt; priced laptop. In fact, if I had the spare cash lying around I'd amlost 
&gt; be tempted to buy a few, for when I need to use a portable under extreme 
&gt; conditions, so I don't have to care if they get dented.
&gt; 
&gt; I doubt they would be anywhere nearly as robust as my ThinkPad, however.
&gt; 
&gt; Mmmm.. ThinkPads...
