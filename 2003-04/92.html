&gt; An XBox is really very similar to a PC. It is a piece of hardware that
&gt; runs software. Why do you think there should be any difference ethically
&gt; in what you are allowed to run on it?

I think there are two issues here.  First, without any doubt, Microsoft
do sell you the hardware.  You own it and can whatever you want with it.
You may bang nails through it to turn it into art, if you choose, and
you certainly may run any software you want.  Whether or not you *can*
run any software that you want is another matter.  The hardware which
Microsoft sell is designed to stop you from running any software other
than that which they have blessed.  That's an integral part of their
price model, and they are (or should be) entitled to sell on that basis.
So it's okay for Microsoft to try to stop you running unblessed software
and it's okay for you to try to run it.

The second issue, and the one which puts meat into the sandwich (so to
speak), is the firmware that comes with the hardware.  Firware is, as we
all know, a physical embodiment of software.  You own the plastic but you
don't own the bits.  Microsoft licence you to use that firmware, and I
presume they use much the same license as for Windows.  In other words,
they preclude you from running the firmware on any other machine than the
one it was provided with; they preclude you from changing the firmware;
and they preclude you from reverse engineering or disassembling it.  Again,
these are widely considered reasonable terms, and you are quite at liberty
to refuse them and return the product for a refund if you wish.

While you may not directly modify the firmware you do have the legal right
to modify the hardware (bang a nail through it, install somebody else's
firmware, and so on.)  Installing a mod chip is okay, so long as that chip
is legal.  I dare say Microsoft will attack the authors of these chips,
probably by claiming that they reverse-engineered the standard BIOS.
