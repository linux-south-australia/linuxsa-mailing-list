While folks are talking about uptime and reliability perhaps these 
stats may give you something to chew on. Not sure if there is a measure 
of how many of these sites are Windows or Linux etc. That would be a 
help in interpreting some of these stats.

Cheers,  Ian

 Site Availability

 *  The mean availability of all sites was only 98.72%,
 equating to over 111.13 hours or nearly five days of
 downtime per website, per year

 *  Only a third of the organisations monitored achieved
 99.9% availability or above, which equates to one full
 working day of downtime per year

 *  City councils had the lowest availability over the
 monitoring period at 97.80%, or over eight days of downtime
 per year

 *  Services were available for 99.1% of the monitoring
 period, or over three days of downtime per year

 *  Political parties had the highest availability at an
 average of 99.24%, being down for just over two and a half
 days per year

 Download Times

 *  For customers connecting to the Internet via a modem
 (56kbps), download times would exceed eight seconds for
 95.7% of the websites in the study

 *  The average download time for public sector websites when
 accessing via a modem (56kbps) was 21.8 seconds

 *  All but one of the websites monitored downloaded in under
 eight seconds with a broadband connection (512kbps)

 Connection & Response Times

 *  High response times for some sites leads to the
 conclusion that in half of the 10 worst performing sites by
 download time, poor equipment performance was most likely
 the cause

 Web Page Sizes

 *  At 69kB, the average home page size of public sector
 organisations is 73% larger than the government’s
 recommended page size of 40kB

 *  Due to the size of the homepage alone, customers
 connecting to the Internet via modem will suffer a download
 time of over eight seconds for at least 54% of the websites
