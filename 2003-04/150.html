A guy on the Lindows forum found a Mysql/ODBC/Postgres database frony 
end that I can even understand. :-)

The name is knoda, with the home page at: www.knoda.org

I was able to easily import an Open Office 1.0 csv file into Knoda, and 
Knoda was able to create a table from that very easily.

Knoda looks very promising to me, I did crash when I tried to work with 
anything other than the table. I hope to find an answer to that soon.

Knoda is a KDE application,  and it works on SuSE 8.1 Professional _if_ 
you have upgraded your kde to 3.1. It would not start under 3.0, and LyX 
3.1 would not start as well.

SuSE has a page that lists all of the versions of SuSE that can be 
upgraded to KDE 8.1 on this page:

<A HREF="http://www.suse.com/us/private/download/linuks/index.html">http://www.suse.com/us/private/download/linuks/index.html</A>

I am going to write @ my experiences with SuSE 8.1 during the upgrade 
from KDE 3.0.4 to 3.1.

The first thing I did was run a program called siga, which creates a 
file called /tmp/siga/siga.txt.  This file contains a very comprehensive 
report on your system, including RPM packages that are installed on the 
box. I copied the file to my home directory by going to the console and 
typing the following:

cp /tmp/siga/siga.txt /home/james

I then changed the owner of the file from root to James, so I could read it:

chown james siga.txt
chgrp users siga.txt

I then was able to open up LyX by using my mouse to go 
toKmenu/Office/Word Processor/LyX. If you do not have LyX installed, you 
can install it through the Yast Control Center.

In Lyx just go to File/Import/ascii text as lines/ and select siga.txt.

It will automatically create a siga.lyx file for you. Save that by going 
to file/save.

Create a new document with file/new and then call it apps, and save it. 
 On the first line, put the title of the document, and then go to the 
left and select title. It will format it for you. Really easy by the way.

Go back to the siga.lyx document by selecting documents/siga.lyx 
Highlight section 2 and then go back to apps.lyx and then paste. Print 
that out.

Now, I pretty much have SuSE 8.1's default installation on my machine, 
along with a few extra applications including apt.  Apt is not a 
requirement, but it will make your life a heck of a lot easier.  To 
install apt, just do a yahoo search for apt for SuSE, and try to follow 
a post I made on this earlier if the instructions on the web page are 
not clear.

A word of warning on this before you start....don't shut down the 
computer, or even close the shell while you are in the middle of doing 
this. KDE displays your shell, and if you are not comfortable not having 
access to KDE, closing the shell or restarting the computer while you 
are upgrading is a sure way to get yourself in a jam.

Bottom line is, see the procedure through to completion, and enjoy a 
smooth process.

Back to SuSE's web page.  Since I have SuSE 8.1, I went to that page, 
which has a listing of all the SuSE applicaitons available for 8.1:

On this page there are 5 package groups:

* Base packages

* Language Support

* KDE Applications

KDE Development Packages

Expirimental KDE Packages


*Most people will only want to use these.

I installed the packages in the order listed on the page.

I first installed arts, arts-gmcop, and kde2-compat.

NOTE: The _next thing I SHOULD have done was UNINSTALL pixieplus-kde. If 
you do this BEFORE you install kdebase3, all will go smooth all the way 
through the end of the base package installations.

As for language support, I only installed kde3-i18n-en_GB and 
koffice-i18n-en_GB.

In the KDE Applications section, all went smoothly as I only selected 
applications that I already had installed.  However, you ought to 
install knoda & hk_classes, both of which are listed in this section.

Now, before I installed KDE games, I had to uninstall the remaining kde 
3.0.4 applications and Kile.
The following command worked nicely:

rpm -qa | grep 3.0.4 | xargs rpm -e

Note that you can just run:

rpm -qa | grep 3.0.4

To see what will be uninstalled.

By the way mine was 3.0.4 because I had already ran the Automatic update 
in the Yast 2 Control Center in SuSE 8.1. (If the Auto update does not 
work in SuSE 8.1, use apt to reinstall yast2-core, yast2-packager and 
yast2-packagemanager with apt:  apt-get install yast2-core 
yast2-packager yast2-packagemanager.

Go ahead and run the command, reinstall Kile with apt, and then proceed 
down the list.

When you are finished, you will have a working kde3.


Ok, now for Knoda.

If you don't have mysql installed, install it.

Go to your shell and type this command to make mysql useable:

mysqladmin -u root password the_password_you_want_to_use

Example, if I wanted to use OpenUP as my password, I would type the 
following at the shell:

mysqladmin -u root password OpenUP

To start knoda, type knoda at the console.

Select mysql

Select Connect

You are root and the password is whatever you picked.   (You can worry 
about permissions later. But not too much later. :))

As in access, there are these categories to work with listed:

Databases

Tables

Queries

Forms

Reports


Lets import our table:

Go to action, import, CSV, and take in your table.

You can double click on your table and print it.

I imagine that the rest would work just like MS Access, which I have 
used often.



James Leone

P.S. LyX looked a heck of a lot nicer and was easier to work with after 
I upgraded to 1.3.1.
