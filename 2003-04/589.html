Ops,
My mistake, nevermind.

Thanx for pointing me to the light.

Agreed it should be pulled. What an amazing piece of propaganda,
everyone knows that Gentoo is the best :p
(kidding)

Ciao,
Rick

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The whole thing begs the question that if you don't in fact use Lindows,
&gt; &gt; then why would you be wasting your time on their website to know that
&gt; &gt; the poll even exists, yet alone use it.
&gt; 
&gt; Because it isn't on the Lindows Web site. It is a stand-alone site that
&gt; ostensibly tries to help people find out about Linux and which Linux distro
&gt; is for them.
&gt; 
&gt; It does say down at the bottom that it is sponsored by Lindows. What it
&gt; doesn't say is that it is built by Lindows, owned by Lindows and
&gt; deliberately skewed towrds Lindows. 
&gt; 
&gt; IMHO the site is a sham and should not be up on the net.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Btw, couldn't find that nice background :(
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I will see if I can find it elsewhere. I have written to the page owner,
&gt; perhaps he can point me to the graphic.
&gt; Anyway, the picture is of penguins in the Antarctic jumping off an ice
&gt; flow. The ice flow has been modified to the shape of the Windows logo ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; A perfect background graphic.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,  Ian
