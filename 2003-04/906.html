&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Lehey exhibits all the worst things I have heardabout the BSD
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;culture: he's snobby and argumentative and can't stop promoting
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;himself (see the plugs for his books). But the other guy, Warner,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;seems to have his head on straight and really know what he's talking
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;about. I say promote the latter and give the former the boot.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The problem with being really good at what you do is that others often
&gt;&gt; mistake superiority for attitude.  It's mostly dweebs who make that
&gt;&gt; mistake!
&gt;
&gt; i have used FreeBSD for about six years, for its tecnical merrits. i've
&gt; done support for may folks with FreeBSD, used it in large scale
&gt; hosting, and it was my primary desktop environment for a couple of
&gt; years.
&gt;
&gt; but over the last ten years of using linux, and asking many folks fer
&gt; help, i have rarely, if ever had the kind of abuse from FreeBSD folks.
&gt; especially those folks that are 'core' and related individuals.
&gt; it is a shame that even only a few eletist whankers can spoil the
&gt; bigger picture, and its fair to say that i have met and worked with a
&gt; lot of good people in the FreeBSD community also in AU and the UK.

Sorry kim, what are you saying ? This reads as if half a dozen crucial
words have been left out of the sentences, rendering it without meaning
one way or the other. Of course, I can read into it anything I like :)
Michael
&gt;
&gt; and balance is always the issue. just a shame i got burnt. to a crisp.
&gt; often.
&gt;
&gt; cheers,
&gt;
