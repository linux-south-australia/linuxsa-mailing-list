Have you tried just a single PC connected to the ADSL service?

This should eliminate the esmith box as an issue and see if it's a line or 
ADSL "modem" issue.

(For what it's worth I have an Internode Business ADSL 512k/128k service at
home, I use a PII350Mhz box with 128MB ram and it's got no performance 
issues at all - it runs all sorts of things too).

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; A quick pick of your brains regarding possible causes please:
&gt; 
&gt; We have a p3 800 with 256MB Ram box running e-smith as server and gateway. Realtek
&gt; 8139 NICs.
&gt; Recently upgraded it from a dial-up connection to ADSL and added the second
&gt; NIC to do so. The client has complained that often the speed is very slow, even
&gt; worse than when we had them on the dial-up. This speed loss is inconsistent
&gt; though - client PCs accessing the intenet will often load webpages quickly and
&gt; download files rapidly at 26kb/s, but then at other times hardly be able to
&gt; load a web page properly.
&gt; 
&gt; My feeling is that it is the ADSL line or the modem, as they have already had
&gt; troubles with the line in the past (ISP tested it from their end and confirmed).
&gt; On the ADSL modem (DSL-300), the ethernet and ADSL connection lights flash furiously
&gt; all the time, instead of staying on consistently.
&gt; 
&gt; I can ping out of this e-smith box, either internally to hosts on the LAN or
&gt; externally to the internet. Can also establish telnet connections to the box's
&gt; mail ports from an external location. The e-smith resolves names to IP addresses
&gt; fine.
&gt; 
&gt; Their box is also set up the same as one we have here and with the same version
&gt; of e-smith (5.1.2), and we don't have any problems (though their symptoms sound
&gt; like ours when the line is playing up).
&gt; 
&gt; My question is this: is there anything else that I can test in the e-smith to
&gt; eliminate it as a factor in the lack of speed?
&gt; The ISP help desk has suggested that the client unplug their PCs from the network
&gt; and then plug them in one at a time to check if there is a PC causing the fault.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt; Julian 
&gt;
