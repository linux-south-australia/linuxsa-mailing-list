&gt;  &gt; (beats head against wall)
&gt; 
&gt; You're suggesting that actually subsidising a toy (albeit a 
&gt; sophisticated one) is unethical? The worst thing this does is increase 
&gt; the cost of the actual game software if they actually want to make a 
&gt; profit. Consumer factor this in and evaluate its true overall value to 
&gt; themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; Keep in mind that their biggest competitor (Sony) also do this, and to a 
&gt; smaller degree Nintendo.

The issue isn't ethical, it's economic.

As a simple example, consider if car manufacturer Holden designed
its cars to only use Holden fuel, and not to use Ford fuel.

The duplication of infrastructure required to do this would
not benefit consumers -- a single infrastructure would lead
to cheaper transportation due to reduced fixed costs and
price competition.

Attempts by manufacturers to force mechanics only to use
manufacturers' car parts rather than be allowed to use
third-party car parts have foundered on this very point.

In economics-ese, they are attempting "forced product
differentiation to produce tied sales of another product,
resulting in monopoly profits for the tied product".

Most competition laws restrict the use of unnecessarily
"tied" products, since the resulting monopoly and duplication
of infrastrutcure is rarely in the consumer's interest.

Microsoft are not attempting anything different than the
car manufacturers have tried on.  But competition regulators
don't use games consoles, so the analogy may take some time
to become apparent.

Once it does, there's a matter of jurisdiction.  I can't
imagine that any MS employee in Australia knows the software
signing key, publication of which would be the obvious
remedy.  I'm not sure how the proposed free trade agreement
will effect jurisdiction of court orders, if at all.
