so they get a virus once, get their machine cleaned/reloaded at a computer
shop, and they ask how to not get viruses (or virii or whatever), just tell
them don't surf the internet, don't download programs and definitly don't
use email.  that's an interesting idea.

for big corporations with lots of support staff, not running a virus scanner
would be the same except your suddnely your network gets hosed by nimda, non
of your machines or server run AV, your entire network falls to it's knees
and your support staff suddenly stop being productive and go and fight
fires.  good idea.

everyone will realize what happened but that won't stop them opening the
next 'Hey there, check out this screen saver' when it comes around.
managment suddenly realize their computer people are idiots for not running
anti-virus....    that's my 2 bobs worth...

&gt;&gt; I don't think so.  I've so often heard, "I don't have to worry about

&gt;&gt; NOT run a virus checker because then they WOULD worry.  It's the same
&gt;&gt; with firewalls.  (And yes, I have also heard people say that they have
&gt;&gt; a firewall so they don't need to worry about security.)

&gt;That's just dumb. You'd rather they didn't run a virus checker so they
would

I'd rather they realised that were NOT protected from virii.
