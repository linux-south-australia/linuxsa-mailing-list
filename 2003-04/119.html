I moved away from the nvaudio driver on this Suse box when I got a kernel 
panic. Alsa has proved a better option.. Still using the nvnet module for 
networking though.

&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; I have installed Mandrake 9.1 on my friends computer which has the
&gt; following specs:
&gt;
&gt; nforce 2 motherboard and chipset
&gt; AMD XP 2100+
&gt; LITEON burner
&gt; NVIDIA Geforce 3
&gt; I think the board has firewire, USB 2.0, some intel audio (haven't got the
&gt; PC in front of me so I can't get exact information). I have installed the
&gt; binary only nvnet and nvidia geforce drivers (4191, will soon upgrade to
&gt; latest).
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, Mandrake 9.1 is behaving rather strangely on this computer,
&gt; problems i've seen are:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Kernel panicked whilst reading a CD and attempting to play lbreakout2
&gt; (scroll lock and caps lock lights were flashing and computer stopped
&gt; responding)
&gt;
&gt; 2) Just now, attempted to do a burn, whilst the burn was happening I
&gt; attempted to load chromium (which would not load) and frozen-bubble (which
&gt; wouldnt load either).
&gt;
&gt; chromium and frozen bubble were in the process list, but I could not kill
&gt; chromium (I didn't try killing frozen-bubble).
&gt;
&gt; Once the burn completed, frozen bubble loaded sprang to life as though it
&gt; had been sitting there waiting.
&gt;
&gt; It seems that there is a conflict with going to fullscreen mode and using
&gt; the burner. The process requesting full screen mode just sits there and
&gt; waits. I could play cannon smash at the same time with no probs (I wasn't
&gt; in fullscreen mode).
&gt;
&gt; Also, the burn failed at the very end (the part where it closes the session
&gt; i think), k3b reported unknown error and the disk was unreadable.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas what on earth is going on? Mandrake 9.1 works fine on my computer
&gt; (KT266 MB, Athlon T-Bird 1.4, etc)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
&gt; Damien
