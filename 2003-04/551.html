&gt; Firstly the site your are being directed to is a zonelarm ip.
&gt; So asking the obvious any references to Zone alaram on your system?
&gt; 

I used to have ZoneAlarm on the system. Not any more. It has not run for 
weeks. Doesn't exist. No trace in Registry either.

&gt; Secondly did you try and track down the references to the ip within your
&gt; system?
&gt; if file find containing text &lt;ip address? also for the name it resolves to.
&gt; 
Yep. There was one vk something extension in Opera that had the link but I 
deleted that. Nothing else showed up.

&gt; Also do a regedit and do a find in there for the ip address or the name it
&gt; resolves to.
&gt;
Yep. Did that with the IP number, with "LinkSys" and with "zonealarm" and 
"zonelabs". Zip, nada, nuttin'.

&gt; zonealarm is trapping it trying to get out
&gt;
not running anything like that simply because the LAN is supposedly trapping 
all the naughty stuff. I hope.

Thanks for the suggestions though. You've verified that I am trying the right 
things.

Cheers,  Ian
