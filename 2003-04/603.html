&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; Anybody here got the latest RH / Mandrake / Knoppix CD's I could pickup
&gt; sometime today/tomorrow?
&gt;
&gt; Got a few opportunities to introduce Linux as a desktop OS to some people,
&gt; not sure if any distro is up to par yet (I'm happy with my Debian Sid
&gt; desktop, but it's not exactly something most people can/want to do).
&gt;

Mandrake 9.1 has NTFS resizing support in the installer, though the drive has 
to be defragged first (it wont move data). Mandrake 9.1, IMO is the best 
distro to use, assuming that you set it up for them as it does need a bit of 
tweaking. The most important tweak is to setup web sources for urpmi. 

*** What follows is mostly what I wrote to a friend in an email who's trying 
out Linux and so is probably too basic for you, if you think these 
instructions are any good feel free to pass them on to anybody trying 
mandrake, it's just my experiences really. ****

1) add web packages

go to <A HREF="http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php">http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php</A>

choose the sources, plf, texstar, contrib and updates. This web page will 
spit out the commands you will need to paste into a root console in order to 
add the sources. Do these one by one (or stick them in a shell script so they 
run one after the other). Note that the contrib package list is 9MB, the rest 
are a bit over 1MB.

2) Once the sources have been added, load the software installer 
(K-&gt;Configuration-&gt;Packaging-&gt;Install software)

search for the package freetype. There should be a freetype2 package with a 
-plf extension to its name. If not certain, select the "maximum information" 
Radio box and make sure that Source: is plf. This is the hacked true type 
font renderer. The bytecode hinting algorithm is patented by apple and so 
cannot be used legally, hence by default Mandrake uses the auto-hinting 
algorithm which is vastly inferior.

3) Install windows fonts

Open the mandrake control centre (K-&gt;Configuration-&gt;Mandrake Control Center). 
Go to System then Drakfont. Click "Get Windows Fonts", this will copy the 
windows fonts and install them on your system. I know this works for windows 
XP, but im not sure for windows 2000 (it failed to work in Mandrake 9.0 so I 
had to manually copy them). If it doesn't work, copy your true type fonts to 
a directory in /usr/share/fonts, eg /usr/share/fonts/winttf. This path needs 
to be added to fontconfig somehow, either via the config file 
(/etc/fonts/fonts.conf), or via the GUI. In drakfont this can be done by 
clicking "Advanced Options" then clicking Add to add the font directory.

You have to make sure KDE recognises these fonts by using the font installer 
the KDE control centre (just enable the fonts you want).

4) Install the NVIDIA Graphics Drivers (if you have an NVIDIA card)

Download the NVIDIA graphics drivers from the nvidia website. Switch to 
runlevel 3 so that X isn't running (type "telinit 3" at a root prompt). Login 
as root and cd to the directory where the NVIDIA install script is. 

chmod +x the file and run it, follow the prompts to install the drivers. Once 
finished, edit the Xfree config file (/etc/X11/XF86Config-4), and change the 
line that says "nv" to "nvidia". There are some other options that I add, 
here is my nvidia driver setup:

Section "Device"
    Identifier "device1"
    VendorName "nVidia Corporation"
    BoardName "NVIDIA GeForce3 (generic)"
    Driver "nvidia"
    Option "DPMS" "True"
    Option "CursorShadow" "True"
    Option "NoLogo" "True"
    Option "CursorShadowAlpha" "60"
EndSection

This will enable monitor power saving, cursor shadows, and will disable the 
Nvidia splash screen when X starts. 

Switch back to runlevel 5 by typing "telinit 5". Try out the 3d drivers by 
running something like Chromium, Tux Racer, or Cannon-smash.

5) Install sim-icq. 

sim-icq is the best ICQ client for linux by far. There are _heaps_ of instant 
messengers for just about every protocol, but I haven't seen one as good as 
sim-icq (only supports ICQ protocol though).  Do a search in the package 
manager  for it, if it's not there, download it from sim-icq.sourceforge.net. 
The Mandrake 9.0 package seems to work on mine, i dont know what dependencies 
it will want as it was compiled against KDE 3.0 not 3.1. If it wants 
dependencies just do 

rpm -ivh sim-icq-xxxxxxx.i586.rpm --nodeps

I think all 3.x KDE's are backwards compatible and that's all it is really 
relying on.

6) Install ogle DVD player

ogle DVD should be in the software manager if you added plf. This DVD player 
has played every DVD I've ever thrown at it flawlessly (including menu's), 
however I cannot get 4.1 channel sound to work.

8) Go to www.kde-look.org and try out some of the XFree cursor themes. Only 
one of em on there is very practical, but you _have_ to try tuxcursors :) 
They're easy to install, just copy the directories in the archive to 
~/.icons. For example, for tuxcursors, ~/.icons will contain
tuxcursor/
default/

in default is index.theme which tells X what cursor theme to use. The new 
cursors will be used for any newly opened apps. To have it working across 
everything you need to logout and log back in. (This is a very new feature in 
XFree86 and so is not really supported in the Desktop Environments yet).

the plf source has lots of kdeartwork packages that contain heaps of themes 
and icons to try. One of the nice things is to enable menu shadows, open the 
KDE control centre, go to "LookNFeel-&gt;Style" and click the Effects tab, then 
check the "Menu drop Shadow" checkbox.

9) Misc Things to know:

- Try to install packages built specifically for mandrake 9.1, and install 
them through the package manager, or via the command line with urpmi. This 
way dependencies are resolved and it's unlikely there will be binary 
incompatibilities. I've installed a package from redhat 8 before and its 
worked (with --nodeps mind you), but there's certainly no guaruntees. Binary 
incompatibilities is one of my biggest gripes with Linux, hopefully it will 
settle down soon.

- Use xmms as your mp3/ogg player as it is by far the best. Make sure it's 
using ALSA as it's output plugin (the ALSA sound drivers should be enabled by 
default). You can install a panel applet called xmms-kde so that you can 
control xmms via keyboard shortcuts or via the small gui that embeds into the 
panel. I just started using it 5mins ago, and it's pretty sweet. After 
installing, you can activate it by right clicking on the taskbar, and adding 
the applet, or left clicking on one of the arrow thingies that separate KDE 
panel applets (these can be hidden by rightclicking the taskbar, selecting 
Configure Panel, clicking Apperance, Advanced Options, then checking the box 
"Fade out applet handles". If you have 4+ speakers (or even if you dont), 
install alsamixergui to tweak the ALSA settings and to enable sound from your 
rear speakers.

- k3b is by far the best burning program on Linux, it should work out of the 
box. Nice feature for ripping and burning iso's (i.e. not pirated games):
Rip the CD by typing "cat /dev/cdrom &gt; myfile.iso" at a prompt.
Open konqueror file manager, rightclick on iso file, and click burn with k3b. 

- download the windows codecs for xine, be wary of installing the plf version 
of xine however, as i've done that before and it's b0rked my xine install 
(choppy sound, etc). I think there are some divx codecs somewhere too, just 
search in the package manager. You should be able to play just about anything 
(except for quicktime dammit!). Mplayer is aparantly very good also.

- I like kmail as my mail client, but you might like Evolution if you like 
Outbreak express. kmail can import your Outlook inbox and address book too. 
If you want to be able to use the same compatible client on either windows or 
linux, you can use mozilla mail, then symlink mozilla's mail directory to 
wherever the windows one is stored (you need a FAT partition for this because 
Linux can't write to NTFS and you can't symlink in Windows (or write to linux 
partitions). If you want to backup your mail (in kmail anyway), your inbox is 
stored in ~/Mail. 

- Konqueror web browser now has the kget download manager, it uses wget to 
actually do the downloading. It looks similar to getright. You can use wget 
from the command line by:

wget -b &lt;url&gt;

to download something in the background. wget will become a child process of 
Init, so you can even logout and it wont matter, it will still download.

wget -c -b &lt;url&gt;

will continue a broken download. Konqueror also has tabbed browsing support 
now and the rendering engine is being used in apples default browser Safari 
(hence lots of apple bugfixes are being integrated into konqueror).

*** There's probably many other things I've done to tweak my box, but this is 
all I can think of at the moment. ***

Damien Uern
