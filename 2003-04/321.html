&gt; &gt; Have you considered the danger. With a large number of 
&gt; &gt; discarded AK-47s 
&gt; &gt; and a number of unhappy pro-Saddam people wandering about, any
&gt; &gt; random westerner stands a much higher change of being shot, I
&gt; &gt; reckon.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I have (and thanks for your concern) :)  ...

I'd agree on that one also. Mind you some of the Pro-Saddam "activists"
could be ex-Iraqi military.
&gt; 
&gt; And no, I'm not discounting it because of the jubilant scenes
&gt; recently. My plan is to get in, be careful about where I go, and what
&gt; I look like when I go (I don't think I'll be wearing any American
&gt; logos anywhere), learn some Arabic, and take the risk. My motivation

Also.. Don't flash your wealth around i.e. keep a low profile. Also
adopt the same attitude as the expatriate community that have been there
before you. A little bit of paranoia goes a long way as well as being
aware of your surroundings.

&gt; is two fold: the(perceived) danger and the reconstruction program
&gt; means there will be money available (which, I assure you, is actually
&gt; less greedy than it sounds, but I'm not going to defend that point
&gt; publicly), and I also care about reconstructing the country -- in part
&gt; because we should rebuild what we destroyed, and in part because I
&gt; believe better communications for the masses will help them greatly,
&gt; and prevent the rise of another dictator.
&gt; 
&gt; So yeah, it's dangerous. It could be a huge challenge in many ways.
&gt; I'm still keen.
&gt; 

Richard, if you do get to go, good luck. I learnt a lot working in a
developing country. It can be an adventure.
