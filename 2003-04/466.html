&gt; secure because the firewall gives you total security.  That is quite
&gt; wrong.  What firewalls can do is give you a false sense of security.
&gt; They can make you complacent.  False security is worse than no security.
&gt; Firewalls also do get in the way; that's their purpose.  Many people,
&gt; when the firewall gets in the way, simply poke a hole through it without
&gt; really thinking about the ramifications.  Perhaps they find they can't
&gt; send mail from their favoured email client, so they open up the SMTP port.
&gt; Lookout!  Who knows what buffer overflow is there to be exploited.

I'd suggest that perhaps those people shouldn't have access to change
the firewall configuration?

&gt; I think there is no substitute for locking down each and every machine.
&gt; And if each machine is locked down, a firewall really adds very little.
&gt; It presents, perhaps, an additional obstacle for the hacker to circumvent,
&gt; but as I already said, that comes at the cost of an obstacle to the
&gt; people it is supposed to protect.

I agree a firewall can add to complacency, but sometimes its not easy,
practical or convenient to lock down all of the machines on an a
network behind a firewall. For example at home I have a Tivo connected
to my network. It has a cut down version of glibc and doesn't do any
user authentication when you telnet to it - you just get a root
prompt.  Would it be possible to add user authentication back in? Yes,
but it'd be a fair amount of work. The same sort of argument also
applies to development labs where you are building/testing software
that hasn't been well tested and may have security vulnerabilities.
