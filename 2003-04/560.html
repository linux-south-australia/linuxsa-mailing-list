Did you try doing a tracert from the command promt? At least that would 
verify that your ip networking is doing the right thing. The DNS 
settings idea was also a good one. You could also try to telnet to 
places, and then on port 80 to verify that that port is not blocked...

If you can telnet to a server on ports 25 and 23 but not on 80 it would 
suggest something was still blocking that port. From your description it 
seems that at least 25 should be open.

If you have a packet sniffer you could even have a bit more of a 
squiz... if forget the name but I had a good one on windows 98, then I 
changed os :$

Hope that might help somewhat the in finding where your problem is...
