&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (beats head against wall)
&gt; 
&gt; You're suggesting that actually subsidising a toy (albeit a 
&gt; sophisticated one) is unethical? The worst thing this does is increase 
&gt; the cost of the actual game software if they actually want to make a 
&gt; profit. Consumer factor this in and evaluate its true overall value to 
&gt; themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; Keep in mind that their biggest competitor (Sony) also do this, and to a 
&gt; smaller degree Nintendo.

I'm saying that "it makes business sense" is not a justification for
something which is ethically dubious, regardless of the merits and
demerits of this particular example - which as it involves a toy is
both somewhat trivial and far from clear-cut. Examples which better
demonstrate my point are the manufacturers of fashionable trainers
producing said items in Third World sweatshops, and manufacturers of
refrigerant chemicals trying to get the use of simple hydrocarbons
as refrigerants banned on spurious safety grounds.

In this particular case, I would argue that the subsidy is unethical,
as it is a marketing trick that relies on misleading people's
perception of how much they will be paying, by taking into account the
fact that people are bad at including the running costs in their
evaluation of the cost of ownership of something and its "true overall
value to themselves". Manufacturers of inkjet printers pull the same
stunt.

I would also argue against the use of lock-ins to back up this method.
If you're trying to trick someone out of some money, and they see
through the trick, do you really try and carry on with the trick, or
do you just swear quietly and put up with whatever losses you have
incurred trying to set the trick up?
