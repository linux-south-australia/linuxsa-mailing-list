Michael,

Thanks tons for that. It was driving me mad.
After trying for a long time to find the cause of this "feature",
I later removed the Klipper applet because I couldn't work out what it did,
and I need a bit more RAM - basically because KDE uses up about 90 MBytes
of RAM by loading stuff in the "X" process and is really very RAM-hungry all round.
Now I use xterm instead of Konsole because xterm uses very significantly less RAM,
and I use about 45 text terminals at any one time for development.

By the way, another annoying thing about KDE is that whenever the RAM runs out,
which is like about once a day, the Kicker process crashes and I lose the task bar thing.
It took ages to work out that "Kicker" was the name of the task bar so that I could restart it.
I must say that KDE has taken some very unfortunate turns in the last couple 
of years. They're making it more and more uncontrollable and incomprehensible - one of
the reasons I hate MS-windholes. (The word Window is actually a contraction of Wind-Hole.)

Anyway, that's one more annoyance gone.
Now I just have to work out how I'm going to memorize all these 
meaningless program names: Kicker, Klipper, Konsole, ....  
Bring back the dictionary, I say. Where were these people educated?!

Cheers and thanks again,
Alan Kennington.
