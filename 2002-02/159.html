&gt; When signing a pact with the devil, you're naive if you believe you can just
&gt; tear it up anytime you like. They aren't known as Hell$tra for no reason.

Hmm I got one that'll do it.

&lt;rant&gt;
I am with Dingoblue for everything - local, long distance, and Internet.
Next thing I'm getting bills from Hell$tra for somewhat substantial
amounts.  I ring them and tell them that this cannot be so, and they say
it is so and that I WILL PAY.  Then they tell me that it's my phone
company's fault and that I should contact them.

So anyway, to cut a long story short, Hell$tra stole my line back from
my telco (without authorisation) then told me that I'm paying for them
doing it - they even had the gall to charge me a connection fee.  

But after a bit of not paying them and talking to them on the phone they
disconnected me and I was left with no phone and another reconnection
fee to get my phone back on.

When I finally got back to DB for everything (which took forever because
Hell$tra wouldn't release the line for months) I get a Hell$tra bill
with a disconnection fee and late charges for all the other bills on it.

People, stay away from this beast.  They are the M$ of phone companies -
they've had a monopoily in this country for so long that they've got
used to treating everyone like shit because everyone had no alternative.
We should all make moves to get away from Hell$tra and ditch hard wired
land phones ('cos the beast owns the infrastructure and profits no
matter who your provider is).

&lt;/rant&gt;

So there you have it - I hate Telstra!

Adam
