Hmmm.... In the real world it seems that potential employers are looking
for credible qualifications and an acceptance of low pay and submissive
attitude to the established hierarchy. True, presentation plays an all
important role in the final decision to employ or reject, but I suspect
that making the right noises to stroke the right ego's plays a much more
important part in the equation.

For example my own experience.

I have been running linux at home for nearly 7 years. Last year I sat
for, and passed without effort, two of the four SAIR Linux & GNU
Certification Level 1 System Administration exams. (now defunct)

I spend most of my spare time hiding out on EFNET's #linuxhelp(where I'm
a channel op) helping newbie home users, and paid system administrators
fix their problems before their boss fires them or their machines become
unworkable. I've even remotely admin'd many of their machines, and even
production servers.

I have been staff at www.themes.org(now also defunct), and hoping to
work on what may soon replace it i.e. www.themes.net, been one of the
founding members of the fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net project, and I am
currently organising the hosting and web development of
www.unixhelp.info website for the EFNET #linuxhelp's official webpage
that will hopefully be online soon.

I have done several stints of tech support work for isp's where I was
only hired because I knew the sysadmin and the management were desperate
for someone who could do the job without training and at the drop of a
hat, and without questioning the pay. I was even told I'm a natural at
it.

Yet despite all this, I don't even get an interview. I usually just get
the standard "Thank you for your application...." form letter or email,
if that. Once they see on my resume that I spent nearly 20 years driving
taxi's, and nearly 10 before that as a baker, they apparently just reach
for the next application. Recent university graduates must be much more
appealing since they have no inclination to do other than what they're
told, and they have the formal training that I lack. All that I know
I've learned through my own mistakes or by RTFM, and I have no qualms
about speaking my mind, although with customers my diplomatic skills are
second to none.

Okay this mail is as much a bitch as it is an application, but such is
the job market today! As Malcolm once so eloquently put it...
"Life wasn't meant to be easy!" C'est la vie!

P.S. I'm still looking for employment if anyone's willing to give me a
try.
P.P.S. Before anyone complains about this email's content please note I
changed the subject line. Please adjust your spam filters accordingly.

&gt; &gt; hi all again. im doing my major project for tafe and have to set up a small
&gt; &gt; network and document it and was wondering if any one out there dossnt mind
&gt; &gt; me doing some work experience with them for a couple of weeks.if you would
&gt; &gt; like more information please email me back or ring my mobile on 0410
&gt; &gt; 552473. thanks troy
&gt; 
&gt; Others have made very valid comments about your presentation. Putting it
&gt; bluntly it's atrocious, but I assure you that if you persist you'll
&gt; overcome the obstacles and succeed.
&gt; 
&gt; [SIDE NOTE: Toby, it's true what you said but the guy is actually saying
&gt; it -- give him a break. At least he's got the guts to say what he said.
&gt; Geez, I wouldn't have gotten to work with one of the Samba team members
&gt; {hint: he's gone to America} or my current job if I wasn't brazen enough
&gt; to say, "Hey...I haven't got much real world experience but I've read
&gt; this and I run Linux at home and have you got any work and I would like
&gt; to learn from you".
&gt; 
&gt; In the real world I think that people look for enthusiasm and ability as
&gt; well as presentation. And this guy's presentation might break all
&gt; grammatical rules in the universe but I'm sure there's more gals and
&gt; guys like him in the same position who are being silent. I wonder who'll
&gt; get the work experience...]
&gt; 
&gt; Troy, I'm not sure if I can personally help you but I'm willing to talk
&gt; to my line manager about your offer. I think you've made the first step,
&gt; although I would take heed of what Toby has said because the facts he
&gt; stated are valid (1)...
&gt; 
&gt; DSL
&gt; 
&gt; (1)
&gt; 
&gt; The facts are different from the presentation. Toby, could you please
&gt; ensure that your base installation contains the "diplomatic.css" next
&gt; time?
