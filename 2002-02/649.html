Just a suggestion.. You might find that better presentation helps.
Potential employers may be quick to judge you based on your email skills.

For instance, I could come to the conclusion that you don't know what the
"Enter" key is used for. I could also be quite confused because you have two
apparently seperate concepts merged into one sentance, without even a single
comma to help us work out your intentions.

No-one wants to help someone do their homework, without some kind of mutual
help back. You might want to try writing something about what your major
research topic is, and then aim your emails towards potential employers who
could *benefit* from that research.
(Eg. If you've done a lot of research into ways to improve caching
storage length determination algorithms, or asymmetric
least cost for minimum service requirements routing, then you could offer to
employers to do work experience practicing the implementation of the above
on their systems.)

As it stands, it sounds a bit like you're saying you need to learn how to
setup a network, and you'd like someone to teach you for free for a couple
of weeks.

Is your TAFE teaching Linux networking and routing? If so, I'm impressed.
If not, well, you might be asking the wrong list..
