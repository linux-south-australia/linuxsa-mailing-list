Ahem.

Since ISP and business chatter seems to have been accepted by the list
through silence, I'd like to say that I take exception to this opinion.

I work for Adam Internet, who have been doing online services since
1986.

6 months ago, we opened "Adelaide Network Access Point" (Adnap) as a
colocation facility to provide a new home for Adam's servers [1]. A year
in planning, the mission was to create the best possible location to run
our Internet business from. It turned out that we got it right, and the
quality and value were such that 10 other ISP's have moved in or are
buying services from it.

Adam Internet does support it's linux and BSD customers, and uses open
source software extensively throughout its network. It also contributes
patches to open source projects, and has some projects derived from
internal software on sourceforge.

I don't believe it's my place to say if we're better or worse than
Internode, but competition is tight and either way I don't believe the
adjective 'helluva' is warranted.

[1] We have some unconverted space leftover, if anyone would like
80-250sqm of CBD 7th floor office with a 100mbit ethernet link to the
Internet, yell out :)
