Well, not so much 'limit' as 'comfort zone'. We can do things for 
longer distances, but they cost more to deploy (or require more 
expensive antennas and better alignment, or both)

What I need to know is exact distances from your place(s) to Mt Lofty.

Can you each tell me whatever you can about your physical locations - 
ideally if you know where you are on a map and can tell me a distance 
in km's to Mt Lofty, that'd be an excellent starting point, else 
whatever you can tell me will help.

Ideally GPS coordinates would be wonderful, I can drive out and 
gather the GPS coordinates myself during this coming week if needed, 
and then come up with a financial equation that would work for each 
site (and hopefully that'll be cheap enough for you to be 
interesting).

In both of your cases, lets take this off of the list and deal with 
it privately, to avoid boring others to tears :)

If anyone else lives on the eastern side of the hills, can see Mt 
Lofty,  can't get ADSL, and might be interested in a broadband radio 
link, I'd love to hear from you as well - the economics of this sort 
of thing work (much) better in quantity (allows me to share one set 
of radio/antenna systems at the Mt Lofty end into multiple users, 
which spreads the cost per user out).

By the way, the links don't have to be Internet links (though that's 
the simplest thing). Its also possible to deliver them as dedicated 
point to point links to some other defined endpoint location (e.g. to 
an office in Adelaide).

Cheers,
Simon

&gt;&gt;  Yes, once I get above the trees at my end.
&gt;&gt;  How close is this to being reality?
&gt;
&gt;I too enquired of Simon about this.
&gt;He said there's a 10km limit from the transmitter...
