&gt; &gt; And it is getting part way through the first file (which is 
&gt; about 50MB),
&gt; &gt; giving an IO error and then asking for the next volume! ^C 
&gt; at this point
&gt; &gt; kills the tar but leaves the SCSI bus locked so that I 
&gt; can't remove a tape
&gt; &gt; from either the DDS4 drive or the DLT drive. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; the backup machine is running RH7.2 so is there any known SCSI
&gt; &gt; issues with RH7.2? is it possible that it is a problem with the
&gt; &gt; tape? is it possible to "reinitialise" a tape?
&gt; 
&gt; I had a similar problem with a Sony DDS4 tape drive and had to take it
&gt; back get repaired.  Did the problem just start recently or has it been
&gt; that way since you installed the drive?  

To be honest, the machine is a few months old but the tape drive hasn't been
used until now. previous backups were done on another machine without any
problems.

I've just discovered the "mt erase" command and that seems to be working
without any problems. It may be just a media problem so I will try a second
tape tomorrow when the erase is finished.
