Hi Paul.
Hows the RC?
Anyway, I recently wrote a GUI in JAVA for a MATLAB backend amongst all
things. I mainly used the JAVA swing stuff. Pretty easy to get the job done.
I don't know how well you'd go though with reading from the COM port though.
Not something that I have done. (not fast though) but all the classes we
needed were provided and it proved fairly easy.

cheers Darryl.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi there all,
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if some one could point me in the right direction.
&gt; &gt; I have this private project of my own that has been on the 
&gt; back burners
&gt; &gt; for the last 8 years, The problems I have had up to date is what
&gt; &gt; language to use / learn.
&gt; &gt; The project consits of a GPS to obtain locational data and 
&gt; a series of
&gt; &gt; maps that are obtainable 9 cd's for south australia 
&gt; basically needs to
&gt; &gt; 'move the map' image which are tiffs using rs232 data in a 
&gt; standard nema
&gt; &gt; format.
&gt; &gt; There are other things I wouls like to do but this is the 
&gt; bare bones,
&gt; &gt; yes and change maps automatically.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This sounds like a lot of work but I have no idea what 
&gt; would be the best
&gt; &gt; langauge to use, yes I would like to program under linux, pooie to
&gt; &gt; windzose I allready have a program that I have bought and works very
&gt; &gt; well but it requires a fast machine.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have already invested over $1000 in maps only for S.A. and I would
&gt; &gt; like to see them used on a daily bases on a brick pc that I 
&gt; have with a
&gt; &gt; lcd 10.4".
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Some one please HELP...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers Paul Mullins
