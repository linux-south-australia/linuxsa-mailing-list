 &gt; i'm after opinions on BGP routing under linux.
 &gt; - does it work?
 &gt; - does it need massive hardware?
 &gt; - is it reliable/stable?
 &gt; - how difficult is it to install/configure/maintain?
 
Can you participate in a BGP mesh with a Linux box?  Yes.  But then,
you can do that with pretty much anything else which runs BGP.

Can you use a Linux box as a BGP border router?  No - zebra doesn't
get enough link state information to do that properly.  You can with
pretty much anything else which runs BGP, though.

Can you use a Linux box as a BGP route reflector or route server which
other routers can use as a source of routing information?  By all means,
yes.  But then, you can do that with pretty much anything else which
runs BGP.

Can you use a Linux box to redistribute routes learned from other
routing protocols (OSPF, RIP)?  Yes.  But then, you can do that with
pretty much anything else which runs BGP.

Would you trust your entire network to it?  No.  You can with pretty
much anything else which runs BGP.

Considering the entire point of BGP is to maintain your network connectivity
in the event of an outage, trusting the operation of your BGP mesh to the 
software available for a Linux box is a bit counterintuitive.  zebra doesn't
exactly run at "five nines" reliability levels.

Everything you can do with zebra can also be done with anything else
which runs BGP.  Since you need at least one other BGP device on your
network to make up for zebra's deficiencies, you might as well just 
put your BGP bits on that box instead and forget about zebra.

www.zebra.org is where you can get the software from, by the way.
