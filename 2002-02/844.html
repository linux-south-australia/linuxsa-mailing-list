With whom are you agreeing?
Linux is well accepted as "genuine alternative OS to MS "Win XX -whatever" by 
a whole heap of people.
Do you mean UNIVERSALLY accepted?  Well, OK, but what is this "long way to 
go" business?  Why should the Linux community care whether their OS of choice 
is universally accepted or not - isn't that the real question?

As I see it, the motivation to evangelise has little to do with satisfying 
the needs of newbie persons (of which group I still consider myself).  It 
matters litte if Torvalds/Stallman missionaries convert a few citizens to the 
TRUE WAY of LINUX OPEN SOURCE on their home computers.  Of course, if they 
want to undergo the conversion and the learning process that goes with it, 
that's fine. Welcome!

The REAL problem IMHO is that the world domination of M$ is throughly 
unhealthy, inefficient and highly expensive.  South Austraia alone wastes 
millions (yes - millions) of dollars each year on M$ products, superior 
versions of which are available FREE if the switch is made to appropriate 
Unixen.
Now THAT's a battle worth winning!

When that battle is won, all arguments similar to yours will become 
irrelevant.  Not, I'm afraid, that I think they are particularly relevant, 
now.  For so long as WinDoze is taught at Primary school and Secondary school 
and all our Tertiary institutions, used in our hospitals and all our State 
and Government institutions and favoured by specialist programmers for CAD, 
Statistics, Accounting - you name it - running Installfests and being 
generous to newbies is so much (with apologies to Robyn and other ladies of 
delicate sensitivity) "pissing in the wind".

(Not that I think we should stop running Installfests - I think they are good 
for us, as well as for potential newbies)
