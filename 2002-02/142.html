&gt;From: Michael Selge [mailto:<A HREF="mailto:mselge@hansenyuncken.com.au">mselge@hansenyuncken.com.au</A>] 
&gt;I just got off the phone to a rather rude ( to be expected ) Telstra
rep to whom I asked the question. "If I Downloaded 3 gig in the first 2
weeks of this &gt;month and then cancel the T$ contract what happens ?"

Michael

I too just got off the phone from Hell$stra - well actually I had been
trying to contact them for the last two hours.

Their cancellation page on the net doesn't work - but the only way you
can cancel is from the web - if you're still in contract - they are NOT
allowed to do this in accounts/billing/help.

So - after putting me through to departments that had NOTHING TO DO with
what I was trying to accomplish I finally was told to ring 1800 626 589
- as this was the ADSL Cancellation number.

ROFL - rang that number and I was told Tel$tra were too busy with the
number of calls and if I wanted the latest pricing info to visit
www.telstra.com - then it just hangs up........

Hmmmm - lodged ANOTHER complaint with the TIO as I am unable to cancel
my account.

Anyone know of a telco carrier that will give me local call back to
Adelaide????  If so I an swapping ALL my lines from this Hell$tra crap
to someone who will give me SERVICE.  This time they've gone too far -
they have lost my business.
