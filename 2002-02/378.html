What "well known" brands are you referring to? I'm yet to find a
re-badged Toshiba. I've seen laptops that look like a re-badged Toshiba,
but pull them apart and they're a steaming pile of skit.

&gt;     Method two is do what you have done and post to the
&gt; Linux lists and see if anyone can help out. (I'm trying to
&gt; help after all).

I had a look at those Highlander things once. The build quality of them
is somewhere between poor and mediocre, and the performance just as
average. Getting parts for them is also quite painful. At least when you
buy a Toshiba, HP or IBM, you can rest assured that you will be able to
get parts for it in 1, 2 or 3 years time.

&gt;     Method three - take the plunge and buy the Laptop and
&gt; install an intelligent installer distribution of Linux (like
&gt; Suse). This may work on the principle that most Laptops are
&gt; made of standard parts and so distributions like Suse don't
&gt; just look at the Machine BIOS and say HUH?, they actually
&gt; look at the individual parts and work from them. Be warned
&gt; that some distributions are not that intelligent. Any
&gt; distribution that expects you to hand detect hardware and
&gt; set it up will be useless to you unless you like banging
&gt; your head against a wall. As an example, I tried Redhat 7.1,
&gt; Mandrake 7.0 and Suse 7.1 on my laptop (a Toshiba) and had a
&gt; hard time on the first two and had to hand set up lots of
&gt; stuff and download things etc. Suse set everything up except
&gt; my network card (which was an add on anyhow) and I had
&gt; little trouble setting up the network card in the end
&gt; anyhow.

I agree that some distributions are easier to setup than others, but
don't be fooled into thinking that one distribution supports hardware
that another doesn't. It's still Linux under the hood.

When I got my Portege (and again the other day when I got a Satellite) I
found that X was a little troublesome to setup, but all I had to do was
fiddle with /etc/XF86Config.
