My 2c worth

i am existing adsl/internode user and im on a 512/500mb cap. the only reason
i would change to the personal accounts would be for more downloads per
month. 

I want the ports, static ip and i dont want to be disconnected each 18
hours. Its asking alot, i know. but thats what i am after. also i would
expect the price to go up but hey, more downloads means more money.

Thanks,
Andrew

Mark

now I have read Simons email and am aware he is looking into ways to improve
this and will be waiting before I sign up ( I would sign up tomorrow if
there was no port filtering) to see what Internode come up with.

to reply to your last email to me Mark (as I have not been on the 'puter
this weekend)

&gt; I mean, seriously, how many residential users require the ability
&gt; to run an SMTP server?  On a dynamic IP address?

I dont know how many others, but I want to.. isnt that reason enough?? I am
only an average user but I daresay there are many others??!!
[feelfree to back me up here]

&gt; But ask yourself:  Is the difficulty involved in running an SMTP server
&gt; important enough to make the difference?  At the end of the day, that's
&gt; essentially the only thing you can't do as a result of us blocking ports.

If you know that everyone can sidestep this by changing ports the services
run on?? why bother?
you are basically making a lot of extra work for no-real-reason. with the
end result of one blocked service.
isnt it a better option to setup a port scan so you can check and advise
your clients of possible vunerabilities - (after all you are soo concerned
about being responsible network citizens)

&gt; We have spent a lot of time to come up with an outcome which is (a)
&gt; better, and (b) MUCH cheaper than any of our competitors.  It's
&gt; understandable that there are details which some people will decide
&gt; they don't like, but I'm pretty confident that we're still better than
&gt; anyone else in the marketplace.

cheaper yes, better, I dont think better is correct (you could enlighten me
here)

I look at it that if I pay a premium price (and for a residential user $100
a month is premium price) I expect a premium service, without limitations on
anything except maybe a data cap and IP.. DHCP takes the issues of servers
away from those with less experience.
which is I think the main reason for doing this filtering, you are trying to
make the gap bigger between your business and residential services (which is
why I find it insulting that you put everyone in the same basket where they
need to be protected)

&gt;  &gt; and with regards to the contract, what is the problem with dont pay,
dont
&gt;  &gt; get service.. to me thats simple considering you would be paying up
front
&gt;  &gt; (except extra data fees)

&gt; It's only three months.  After that everything is monthly, you can decide
&gt; on a month by month basis whether you want to continue the service.

a contract is a contract, 3 years or 3 months.. and even more bitter when I
have been waiting for this service for a while and have assurances that
Internode dont do contracts..

&gt; It isn't a service based on 3-month contracts.  It's a monthly service,
&gt; with a three month minimum.

it doesnt state that in your price list - it clearly states;
'a quarterly contract applies to this service'
that in legal terms means in 3 month blocks..
but thats only your wording that is incorrect.

&gt;  &gt; also I am also unaware of your links with Internode.?! ( a lot of
we've's in
&gt;  &gt; the email! :)
&gt;
&gt; You'd be the only one who doesn't know :-)

apparently I am not, there you go again, putting everyone in the one
basket.. insulting..

I really hope Simon / Mark, that you do come up with a service that
accomodates for people who want to use their nice fast connection for server
functions, without compromising your good pricing... but until then I will
be staying on a modem link.

and yes, I am a principles person.. :)
