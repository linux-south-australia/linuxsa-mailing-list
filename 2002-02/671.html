Hehe

&gt; First impressions do count. however, i was just wondering about your
&gt; thoughts about other emails? do you always spell check all your emails? and
&gt; get the puntuaction correct? doesn't that waste a lot of your time?


Bull they take a lot of time; they don't take a lot of time for me and 
all my e-mails go out spell checked and grammar checked. All the time. 
Really.

NOTE:
The bad grammar in the above paragraph is intentional.

ANOTHER NOTE:
Please post the above two lines below any paragraph in which you intend 
the grammar to be bad.

&gt;&gt;No-one wants to help someone do their homework, without some kind of mutual
&gt;&gt;help back. You might want to try writing something about what your major
&gt;&gt;research topic is, and then aim your emails towards potential employers who
&gt;&gt;could *benefit* from that research.


I would have assumed that one of the benefits would be having some 
research done for nothing.

&gt; <A HREF="http://www.smoothwall.org/download/pdf/docs/0.9.9/doc.faq.pdf">http://www.smoothwall.org/download/pdf/docs/0.9.9/doc.faq.pdf</A>  It's a great
&gt; little article about how to write emails for help, what to write and what
&gt; not to write (and get your head bitten off).


Well, model all e-mails for help on this:

**
Hey You Grubby [LinuxSA Members/Grub Maintainers]

My Linux is [not working|broken].

HELP ME

**


Simple really?


&gt; There was some good advice about stating what skills you have and what
&gt; you're hoping to achieve... maybe you should repost that?? (if you dare!)


Dare to be different...
