&gt;Just a suggestion.. You might find that better presentation helps.
&gt;Potential employers may be quick to judge you based on your email skills.

First impressions do count. however, i was just wondering about your
thoughts about other emails? do you always spell check all your emails? and
get the puntuaction correct? doesn't that waste a lot of your time?

&gt;No-one wants to help someone do their homework, without some kind of mutual
&gt;help back. You might want to try writing something about what your major
&gt;research topic is, and then aim your emails towards potential employers who
&gt;could *benefit* from that research.

very true! homework is important! troy; you should read the preface in
<A HREF="http://www.smoothwall.org/download/pdf/docs/0.9.9/doc.faq.pdf">http://www.smoothwall.org/download/pdf/docs/0.9.9/doc.faq.pdf</A>  It's a great
little article about how to write emails for help, what to write and what
not to write (and get your head bitten off).

There was some good advice about stating what skills you have and what
you're hoping to achieve... maybe you should repost that?? (if you dare!)
