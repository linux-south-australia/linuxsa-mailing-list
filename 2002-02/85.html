Hi Micheal,
    I found very similar problems until  I moved to fastmail.

They have the following
IMAP
POP
Online mail

they provide 7 free addresses based on your ID
ie
<A HREF="mailto:d_delyn@fastem.com">d_delyn@fastem.com</A>
<A HREF="mailto:d_delyn@fastmail.fm">d_delyn@fastmail.fm</A>  // @fastmail.fm @eml.cc @f-m.fm myfastmail.com 
@speedymail.org

100mb mailbox intro offer

and for those that sign up a few friends this becomes permanent
otherwise it's planned to drop to 10mb

fast service from somewhere in micronesia  site is <A HREF="http://www.fastmail.fm">http://www.fastmail.fm</A>

MMM! Updated info from site as below.

*FastMail is not currently charging or accepting money for any services. 
We expect this to happen sometime around March 2002. For the moment, you 
can use FastMail completely for free. You will have access to all 
features and a 100M mailbox. The details below describe approximately 
how we envisage FastMail will transition to a paid service. More details 
will be provided as we finalise them*

When you use FastMail.FM you will like it so much that you will tell 
your friends. And when you discover the power of the advanced features 
available to paying members, you may well decide to upgrade your 
account. By providing a great free service, and an even better paid 
service, everyone wins! Since not all features of the paid service are 
released at this stage, we're giving all users free access to everything 
for the next few months. In fact, by signing up now you will also get 2 
free months of continued use of an upgraded account even after we 
release the paid service! A summary of proposed pricing and free 
features after this time is below.

    * Guest account: Free. 10 Meg quota, free access to IMAP and web
      interface!
    * FastMail.FM member: $9.60 /one-time/ fee, nothing more to pay! 15
      Meg quota, Fully customisable forwarding service. Multiple
      'personalities' to send using different addresses (send from your
      work address!). Notification window tell you when mail is
      received. No 'Sent with FastMail.FM' tag on emails
    * Full account: $19.95 per year (short contracts available). 50 Meg
      quota. Send email without using your ISP using our SMTP server.
      POP access if you don't have access to IMAP. Store 5MB of files
      and make them accessible over the web. Use three different aliases
      to keep your work, personal, and hobby email separate. Even use
      your own domain (setup fee applies).
    * Enhanced account: $40 per year. 150MB storage, plus 25MB for
      files. Choose whether your files are publicly accessible over the
      web, or for your eyes only. Access your files directly using
      Windows Explorer. Free use of your own domain name, with up to 5
      addresses. Free pager notification of urgent emails.

If you refer customers, you can get free upgrades. Refer someone who 
gets a full account, and get $3, or $6 for an enhanced account, or $0.75 
for referring someone who becomes a member. Make sure they put your user 
name in the 'referrer' field on the signup page, of course. These 
credits can be used for getting free account upgrades for yourself and 
your friends.

&gt; Hi.
&gt;
&gt; I have tried several free web mail providers including Hotmail and
&gt; Yahoo, and am becoming more annoyed with these services, as they do not
&gt; provide the depth of features available in many mail clients such as
&gt; Netscape Messenger and Mozilla Mail-News.
&gt;
&gt; I'm looking for a mail account I can access most anywhere that has good
&gt; filtering, good storage options (such as folders and subfolders), allows
&gt; me to store a resonable amount of mail, and is highly reliable.  It
&gt; would also be desirable if this client had a web interface so it could
&gt; be accessed in any web browser, did not have excessive advertising,
&gt; filtered bulk/spam mail, could receive mail sent to a domain I
&gt; registered, and provided other features such as downloading all my mail
&gt; to a local file.
&gt;
&gt; I have come to think that perhaps an IMAP mail account would be best, as
&gt; these features would rely more on the mail client's (MUA's) abilities,
&gt; rather than the limited features that most public mail accounts seem to
&gt; provide.  It would seem to costly for me to run my own mail server.
&gt;
&gt; Can anybody suggest a public IMAP mail account (free or fee) that
&gt; satisfies all these criteria?  Can anybody suggest a web mail account
&gt; that does these things?  Any other ideas?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to anybody who can help.
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt;
