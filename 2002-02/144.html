Hi,

On your next call to them, let'm know you're next move will be to complain to 
the telecommunications ombudsman.  That helped speed things up for me some 
time back when I was getting no cooperation over getting a new phone line in 
country SA.  Farily amazing turn-around really.  Pitty to have to resort to 
it though, doesn't engender a lot of good will.  Might be worth a try anyway.

Cheers

Andrew

&gt; &gt;I just got off the phone to a rather rude ( to be expected ) Telstra
&gt;
&gt; rep to whom I asked the question. "If I Downloaded 3 gig in the first 2
&gt; weeks of this &gt;month and then cancel the T$ contract what happens ?"
&gt;
&gt; Michael
&gt;
&gt; I too just got off the phone from Hell$stra - well actually I had been
&gt; trying to contact them for the last two hours.
&gt;
&gt; Their cancellation page on the net doesn't work - but the only way you
&gt; can cancel is from the web - if you're still in contract - they are NOT
&gt; allowed to do this in accounts/billing/help.
&gt;
&gt; So - after putting me through to departments that had NOTHING TO DO with
&gt; what I was trying to accomplish I finally was told to ring 1800 626 589
&gt; - as this was the ADSL Cancellation number.
&gt;
&gt; ROFL - rang that number and I was told Tel$tra were too busy with the
&gt; number of calls and if I wanted the latest pricing info to visit
&gt; www.telstra.com - then it just hangs up........
&gt;
&gt; Hmmmm - lodged ANOTHER complaint with the TIO as I am unable to cancel
&gt; my account.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know of a telco carrier that will give me local call back to
&gt; Adelaide????  If so I an swapping ALL my lines from this Hell$tra crap
&gt; to someone who will give me SERVICE.  This time they've gone too far -
&gt; they have lost my business.
