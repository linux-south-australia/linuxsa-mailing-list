Hi Andrew,

    Most of the cdrom burning programs look for scsi cdroms and don't 
recognise the ide atapi cdrom

But, my burners IDE, Yes, but if you check your config you will find 
that it's also registered as scsi using ide-scsi  setting when mounted. 
Creating the extra device scd0 (Presuming you have no other scsi devices)

You therefor have two choices, read up on devfs and mounting ide-scsi or 
use a program that recognises ide drives

I opted for the later and use cdbakeoven,
To record choose  copy music or data cd
Set your source and data cd's in the tabs provided and burn.
if your cd's dont show immediately then choose settings | device 
settings | rescan and it usually picks up all IDE and scsi cdroms.
 
Otherwise use GCombust and remember to address the drive by its device 
allocation
first mount your drive (alt f2 mount /mnt.cdrom)

ie  GCombust | burn
select existing image  and enter /dev/hdb   (alter to suit your drive)
click on the info button check your cd is iso9660 then burn

nb. If your cd is not a iso9660 then leave the location info in this 
window and choose the option above
enter a destination for the image created ie /home/yrname/newimage.iso 
and click the
(read image from cd ) button just below this. Wait for it to create the ISO
When finished burn your Cd

Hope this helps
David Delyn







&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I have just installed a second CD-drive (an ordinary 52x LG CD Reader) in my 
&gt;computer and have reinstalled linux (Mandrake 8.1) in the hope that the 
&gt;machine will then recognise this second drive.
&gt;
&gt;After reinstalling linux I can, as expected, mount both drives via shell. 
&gt;Also, they appear as CDROM (which is a Sony 16x10x40) & CDROM2 (the 
&gt;LG 52x) within the mount folder and data on CD's in either drive can then be 
&gt;accessed (after mounting), as expected.
&gt;
&gt;Problem is that after I start up either Gnome-Toaster, CreateCD or 
&gt;X-CD-Roast, and attempt to set up for recording from one to the other, the 
&gt;search for drives fails to recognize CDROM2, despite finding the Sony 
&gt;CD-RW.  So I haven't yet got very far in my attempt to copy 
&gt;from disk to disk.  
&gt;
&gt;Has anybody experienced this problem or is there something obvious I've 
&gt;missed that I should have done to enable these programs to recognise the 
&gt;ordinary CD-reader drive please.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;
&gt;Andrew
&gt;
