&gt; like more information please email me back or ring my mobile on 0410
&gt; 552473. thanks troy

Others have made very valid comments about your presentation. Putting it
bluntly it's atrocious, but I assure you that if you persist you'll
overcome the obstacles and succeed.

[SIDE NOTE: Toby, it's true what you said but the guy is actually saying
it -- give him a break. At least he's got the guts to say what he said.
Geez, I wouldn't have gotten to work with one of the Samba team members
{hint: he's gone to America} or my current job if I wasn't brazen enough
to say, "Hey...I haven't got much real world experience but I've read
this and I run Linux at home and have you got any work and I would like
to learn from you". 

In the real world I think that people look for enthusiasm and ability as
well as presentation. And this guy's presentation might break all
grammatical rules in the universe but I'm sure there's more gals and
guys like him in the same position who are being silent. I wonder who'll
get the work experience...]

Troy, I'm not sure if I can personally help you but I'm willing to talk
to my line manager about your offer. I think you've made the first step,
although I would take heed of what Toby has said because the facts he
stated are valid (1)...

The facts are different from the presentation. Toby, could you please
ensure that your base installation contains the "diplomatic.css" next
time?
