i agree with the small charge approach.  if this can deal properly with M$
office files
then why not pay $50 per machine..  way cheaper than $700 plus for m$ clog
if you ask me..

sun has to pay their programmers something and when they don't charge for
software the money doesn't float down
out of the sky...

&gt;This is still a huge change in approach though, is it not?
&gt;Well, I for
&gt;one will have to use OpenOffice in future instead of Star.

Only if you're not willing to pay for any software at all, period.

Personally I'd be one of the first to go out and buy a copy, obviously
depending on cost, but I can't see them charging $600++ like certain
other Office suites.  For the functionality you get it would be worth
paying say $100 for it, I don't have a problem with that, when I do
complain is when people are expected to pay 50% of what their computer
is worth for a suite of programs, doesn't compute with my small brain
capacity.............

Going by my brief looks at both the beta version and the Openoffice
development I think the idea of Linux desktops in business/corporate
environments is getting closer to reality.  (Of course for small business
you still have issues such as Quickbooks/MYOB, but for a lot of corporate
environments where office/mail/internet is the primary concern.......)
