It's becoming apparent that there are different preferences out there
for either BSD or Linux and I am becoming concerned that there might
erupt another UNIX brawl bertween these two platforms, 

its a bit like having the UNIX camp being on the group of people who
like to play football and the windows group people who like to play
soccer, and the BSD team and the Linux team on the same competition
freindly but competitive.

at the present we are trying to get the soccer crowd to come and play
football with us but if for instance we are continuing to have a Port -
Norwood type of conflict in the camp the soccer crowd are going to think
that were nuts and we arent serious about what we are doing.

this one fact remains, we all need to band togeather to see the common
acceptance of the UNIX platform and we all rely on the work of the Free
Software Foundation (and I accept that both Linux and BSD would still be
arround in some form or another without it but our lives are richer for
its existence), so lets get on and work with our prefered platforms and
respect what the other is doing as one or the other is not the real
competion

Cheer Darrin

PS instead of using [OT] how about [BSD]

&gt; &gt; &gt; FreeBSD isn't Linux.

&gt; &gt; Oh, damn -- I thought that the "Linux Compatibility" port in FreeBSD 
&gt; &gt; kinda made that statement redundant.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought this was a Linux mailing list....therefore that lead me to think
&gt; &gt; &gt; that some people may be offended by posting FreeBSD questions without an [OT] in the subject.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It's probably only off-topic if you're trying to sell FreeBSD (1)...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; DSL
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (1) That sounds even more stupid than "sell Linux" ;-P
