&gt;&gt; Maybe it's time the TIO was brought into the picture on Hell$tra.
 
&gt;The TIO is an office of *last* resort.

It seems alot of the time mentioning the words TIO or Cicero (Internal
Complaints System) are the only ways to get any action out of Telstra
and their drones.

&gt;Step one would surely be to /read/ the contract you signed, see what it
says about cancellations, and determine whether 
&gt;Telstra is following it to the letter.

&gt;If they are following it to the letter, the TIO's response will be,
"No, sorry, they're doing exactly what you agreed they &gt;should do," and
you will have wasted your time.

&gt;If they're not following it to the letter, you take it up with Telstra
first (if you don't get any joy from the person you &gt;talk to, ask to
talk to their superior, and keep going until they won't let you talk 
&gt;to any other superiors).  If you fail to do that before you go to the
TIO, the TIO's answer will be, "Customer has not    &gt;given Telstra the 
&gt;opportunity to settle the issue internally, therefore there is not yet
any cause for adjudication."

It seems Telstra drones adopt the "He / She isnt really serious" then
they adopt the "Supervisor isn't available" after 5 minutes on hold etc
etc. If I make a request to talk to a supervisor and am told nobody is
available it surely shouldn't be up to me to jump through their hoops
until they get their act together.

&gt;This all gets back to why it's so important to read the terms and
conditions which govern any Internet access supply:  A   &gt;lot of people
seem to sign contracts which can be boiled down to, "The Supplier Is
Permitted To Do Something You Hate,"   &gt;then they get irate when the
supplier actually /does/ something they hate.

/rant 

I think the main argument is - Telstra construct terms and conditions
which basically say "We may not screw you now, but if we want to in
three months time, we will... And you'll enjoy it.

I think that really what everyone's beef is, is this - Telstra basically
put terms and conditions into contracts which in all truth have no place
in a contract, we have all the responsibility - they have none. It
always seems we have to go along and pay our money every month with a
big smile on our face while they just change anything and everything
when they see fit. Offering customers the ability to cancel a contract
because of adverse pricing changes is the very least they should do.
They should also be offering pro-rate rebates on connections fee's to
reflect the complete waste of money customers have outlaid due to their
inability to keep a business case for any longer than six months.

/end rant
