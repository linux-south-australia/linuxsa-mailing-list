&gt; &gt;now for those RF/wireless techo types: how far does 802.11b go?
&gt; &gt;isn't that the "home wireless network" type system?
&gt; 
&gt; It can easily do 10km's with the appropriate antennas and 
&gt; professional installation. Its all about rf power times the gain of 
&gt; the antennas concerned.
&gt; 
&gt; And 'yes'.

ok good
 
&gt; &gt;I'm hoping to adopt a similar type of thing for myself you see
&gt; &gt;stretching approx 10km to Internode on the top of Mt Lofty.
&gt; 
&gt; In this case, it'll be us doing the engineering (or more accurately 
&gt; our carrier company, Agile). We do a lot of these. The trick is 
&gt; getting the economics down to a rational level for your situation 
&gt; (the equipment becomes expensive - in the end its the antennas and 
&gt; the cabling more than the radio termination gear that becomes the 
&gt; dominant cost - plus some rather non-trivial equipment needed at our 
&gt; end to bring it all back into the rest of our network).

I'm also thinking though that at my end, my antenna will have to be
out in a paddock at the top of the hill we're on as that has the
line of sight to Mt Lofty (the stock have a nice view) - ie. some 
distance from the house.  So rather than running cable (and digging 
a trench) I'm wondering about doing another wireless 'hop' from there 
back to the house.

&gt; Patience, David :) I'm just solving a number of higher priority 
&gt; challenges this week, we'll get back to this one in a week or two's 
&gt; time to pursue it further.

ok, well, as soon as you can then! :)
(BTW I enquired about ADSL with telstra, they reckon the exchange
can't do it and to try again in a few months so I've now officially
given up on ADSL)

Dave.
