I have noticed that several US computing companies have a complete 
disregard for anything foreign.  There is a prevalence in many US-lead 
projects to always use pounds, inches, US letter-sized paper, US date 
format (bloody confusing), and US English.

(This is definately not aimed at Red Hat or my employer!)

Microsoft is even said to have a "MESE" policy, short for "make 'em 
speak English".  I remember there was a debate a little while ago about 
Norway having two (official?) languages, and some companies were only 
supporting one, but KDE supported both -- it's a great example of why 
the freedom to modify source code GNU-style is so useful.

Yes, it's annoying, but it's not entirely surprising.  I find KDE has 
better internationalization and foreign language support, and it's not a 
coincidence that it's what European Linux distributions (such as SuSE 
and Mandrake) use as their default desktop, whereas Red Hat uses the 
USA-lead GNOME.

(Sure, there's developers from all over the world working on both, but 
GNOME is more US-centric.)

Just my personal opinions, as always. :-)
