Richard

&gt; The HTML email thread has been done to death. The conclusion is always

HTML e-mail is evil.

&gt; hard not to degenerate (hell, I've done it often enough), but if we all
&gt; default to tolerance (of newbies, pour speling grammar, OT messages, and
&gt; of people who get defensive or offensive), then the attitude will build

I agree with everything you say Richard, but I think you should add
"acceptance that some list members will not agree with every statement
that has been made and argue strongly to support a different or even
contrary argument". What they are actually saying is that I am
displaying "attitude" -- for some definition of attitude -- because of
what I am saying. I think they are trying to say "we don't like the way
he's saying it".

I consider the arguments used to say that "Windows" is better than
"Linux" shaky at the best and I have pointed out why. Noticably, I've
not actually enunciated any binary (i.e. yes or no) position on this
matter. All I've done is say I think your arguments are bad, try again.

:-)

Nothing has changed at all around here.
