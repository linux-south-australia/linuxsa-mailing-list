Hmm looks very good indeed Simon. Seems like a fiar ballance between features and price. I passed the pricing around work this afternoon - lots of people seem excited! 

You may yet give To$tra a well needed wacking (not that they seem to care about residential DSL anymore :( ).

I hate to pick on such a good service, (and you did ask for comments :P ) but one thing comes to mind - how about some differential charging so that people can download stuff from local sites (eg Netcraft's Linux FTP Server - which I beleive is in Internode's server room) at little or no cost - surely this doesn't cost Internode anything :)

&gt; 
&gt; I hope y'all like it.
&gt; 
&gt; A lot of effort has gone into trying to strike a balance between 
&gt; charging a fair price, and ensuring that the service is sustainable 
&gt; to provide.
&gt; 
&gt; Your comments, as always, are welcome. And so (at last!), are 
&gt; your orders :)
&gt; 
&gt; See
&gt; 	<A HREF="http://adsl.internode.on.net">http://adsl.internode.on.net</A>
&gt; 
&gt; For the good stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; (Especially the "more information" link, as well as (of course) the 
&gt; price list and order form links)
&gt; 
&gt; Orders taken now. Provisioning begins next week, with first service 
&gt; deliveries expected from the week after that. Now would be a great 
&gt; time to cancel your Telstra ADSL service and make the move.
&gt; 
&gt; NB for people who -are- moving from Telstra, note that you -do- need 
&gt; to disconnect with Telstra before we can reconnect you via Internode. 
&gt; There isn't any 'cleaner' way, and it does mean you'll have no 
&gt; broadband for a few days in the middle.
&gt; 
&gt; However, we do supply you with access to a nationally available dial 
&gt; account as an included part of our service, perfect for that 
&gt; transition period :)
&gt; 
&gt; [And, again, see the 'more information' link for other cool 
&gt; features as well]
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt;    Simon Hackett
