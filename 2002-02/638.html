hmm nah you can get transmeta chip'd vaios at the sony shop on grenfell
st (at least you used to be able to)

they were sic. really small (&lt;1.1kg?) 600mhz, 13 hr battery life on a
lappy!

they were REALLY sic..

j

&gt; 
&gt; AFAICR Sony has used them in a Japanese only model, but no-one has
&gt; adopted them into a device for the US/rest-of-world market.  Transmeta
&gt; themselves made some announcement in the past 6 months that they were
&gt; going to release a web pad or similar device due to te slow uptake by
&gt; manufacturers that had existing Intel contracts.  Don't think it's been
&gt; released.  Part of the reason (IMHO) is that plethora of StrongARM based
&gt; Linux PDAs out there now.  Slightly overlapping and overpopulated market
&gt; now.
