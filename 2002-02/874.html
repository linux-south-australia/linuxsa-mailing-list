&gt; Has anyone had any experience in setting mirrored servers.


I think you'll need to specify more clearly what you mean. Just as a 
start do you mean:

* mirror the whole file system?
* mirror just the database onto one or more servers, and then load 
balance the whole lot through some sort of proxy server?

&gt; I have a
&gt; requirement for a lot of speed ie. a big database with maybe serveral
&gt; hundred users and also need some redundancy.


You might want to look at <A HREF="http://linux-ha.org/">http://linux-ha.org/</A>

That's the high availability sight.


&gt; I have had a quite look at Beowulf but I am not sure if this a bit of an
&gt; over kill.


Or even the right tool. I thought that applications needed to be written 
ground up to run on a Beowulf server but I may be just plain wrong.


&gt; Any suggestions welcome as I have no experience in this area.


Well, all real databases (i.e. Oracle, DB2, MySQL, Postgres) now support 
  live replication to some degree.

That is to say you write to database A and the write is then committed 
to database B. You can make this completely atomic; that is to say if 
the write to B does not occur then the whole transaction fails. 
Naturally, database A could write to many databases.

You would then, at least when reading, be able to sit a proxy-load 
balancing server which doles out read requests to your farm of 
databases. I suspect that Oracle and DB2 might be able to do this 
without the existence of outside utilities...

I would strongly suggest you sacrifice speed for reliability. You can 
make the database really fast by losing all your data but that kinda 
misses the point.
