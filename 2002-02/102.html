Thankyou everyone for your responses so far.

Seems there are a few pointers towards cdbakeoven, so I've downloaded the 
lates version (rpm) from sourceforge, and installed.

It seems to be recognising both drives.  In the CD-Copy Dialog, hitting the 
'detect' button gives the following:

/dev/hdc Sony-RW CRX1611	Driver: ide-scsi	SCSI: n/a
/dev/hdd LG CD-ROM CRD08522B	Driver: ide-cdrom	SCSI: n/a
/dev/scd0 Sony-RW CRX1611	Driver: n/a	SCSI: [00,00,00]

Options selected in CD-Copy Dialog have included:
	Source: LG CDROM  (nb this is /mnt/cdrom2)
	Destination: Sony CD-RW (nb this is /mnt/cdrom)
	Recording Details: Test & Burn
	CD Type: Music

Hitting button in CD-Copy Dialog "Preview" brings up the response: "CDROM 
read or access error (or no disc in drive).  Please make sure you have access 
permissions to /dev/cdrom".

This is happening whether I try to burn as a root user, or as an ordinary 
user.  There is definitely a disk in each of the CD-ROM and CD-RW drives.  So 
I have attempted to change permissions for /dev/cdrom please ?  In shell as 
root user, I have typed "chmod 777 /dev/cdrom" but the response is "chmod: 
getting attributes of '/dev/cdrom': No such file or directory"   Then if I 
type "mkdir: /dev/cdrom", I get the response "mkdir: cannot create directory 
'/dev/cdrom': File exists."  

Also in CD-Copy Dialog, if I click "Burn" and hit "Copy!", then I get the 
folowing response: "Chosen directory does not have enough space available for 
storing disk image.  Please choose another location!"  Mmmmm.  It's just a 
very short music CD, so there shouldn't be a problem with there being too 
little space on the destination CD.  Any clues what's going on here ? 

Clicking OK on the above message, closes it, but viewing the Elapsed Time in 
Process Output, shows the timer operating (as if doing the copy).  
Nevertheless, there's no activity from the drives.  

Cheers,

Andrew
