With the 20Gb Travan check the warranty before you buy, we've supplied one
of those that isn't working any more.  We got it with a years warranty on
one but it died just after warranty expired.  This is the only one we're had
dealings with and may have been one of those things with production and
they're a really a good product... i wouldn't buy another.

Subject: DAT, IDE, Linux and low profile PCI...


Hi all...

I'm buying an AOpen H340D case (low profile thingy, apparently quiet)...
and want to put a tape backup device in it (ideally -- a DVD-R would
probably do... :). Anyway, I'd like to use DAT tape, but I can't seem to
find a low-profile SCSI card that will fit in the case (it uses low
profile PCI, which are about 1/2 to 2/3 the height) ... Does IDE DAT
exist -- or is that an oxymoron for a reason I don't understand? If it
exists, does anyone know if it would be supported under Linux -- yes,
I've searched around, and can't find anything IDE/DAT related, so I
thought I'd ask here...

Alternatively, I could get a travan IDE 20G drive -- does anyone have
any experiences with these devices under Linux? I've heard you can boot
off them, too... ?

the DVD-R device is actually reasonably cost-effective in context
here... at least, it's in the same order of magnitude... :) However, I
kinda think that it wouldn't be the best option simply becuase it's not
really designed for that...

any comments?
