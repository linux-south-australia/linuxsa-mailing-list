Generally speaking the more bandwidth people have available to them the more
MB they chunk through in a month. Not simply because they download more,but
also because it loads faster so they look at more, faster. So for 90% of
people they will find that they end up using more on a DSL connection than
they would on a modem connection. IMHO

&gt; One of the problems for me (if I could get dsl.. in the hills, yeah
&gt; right) is the cap would be reached far too quickly. When we were on
&gt; bigpond dialup we reached the 300mb cap in like a week (if we made it
&gt; last the month, it would be avg 10mb a day which we use so quickly). Now
&gt; with the much faster download rate, even a cap of 500mb would go so
&gt; quick you wouldn't know what has happened.
&gt;
&gt; Granted, different people use the net differently. I think if the price
&gt; was reduced more customers who aren't heavy net users would sign up,
&gt; justifying a bigger cap for the few that do need/want it. Then again,
&gt; this might just attract people to scab up all they can and lose you
&gt; money. It's a hard one.

&gt; &gt; Simon,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have looked at your proposed ADSL pricing for home use, and it looks
quite
&gt; &gt; attractive. I would like to say that I can appreciate the tightrope you
are
&gt; &gt; probably walking between pricing and cost of service/support issues, and
that
&gt; &gt; your inital offering is a great start, and will be an excellent
replacement
&gt; &gt; for people on existing dial up services.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You said in one of your emails to linuxsa:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; [1] What I mean here is that some of you have said 'Its wonderful
&gt; &gt; except for &lt;x&gt;'. Well, I challenge you to -buy- it from us if we
&gt; &gt; address &lt;x&gt; to your satisfaction, without then saying 'Oh, thanks,
&gt; &gt; but how about &lt;y&gt;, and -then- I'd like it', and repeating that
&gt; &gt; iterative loop until one of us goes barking bad.  Support us, and
&gt; &gt; we'll keep listening to your needs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, I will accept that challenge. I am an existing, and relatively
&gt; &gt; longstanding, Internode ISDN dial-on-demand customer that *will* be
ordering
&gt; &gt; _one_ of the ADSL products within the next couple of weeks. Which one is
&gt; &gt; still problematic for me. Here is why:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1 .. $90 p/m is probably all I want spend on Internet access. It works
out to
&gt; &gt; around $1000 p/a, in excess of which getting hard to justify.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2 .. I want to be able to run an SMTP server, Web server, ssh server etc
on
&gt; &gt; my machine. This is a lot easier if I have a static IP address.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3 .. I want a traffic cap more in the order of 1 - 1.5 GB p/m that
500MB.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On the surface, it sounds like I want the business service, but with a
higher
&gt; &gt; cap, or a lower price ! Just like any services - you can have high
speed,
&gt; &gt; good quality and low price - pick any two !
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So that is probably what I will go with - the business service. But if
you
&gt; &gt; want to make me a really happy customer, you could think about one of
these:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1 .. Increase the cap on the $89 business service plan, even 500MB -&gt;
750MB
&gt; &gt; would probably be enough to sway me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2 .. Let me pay extra (say $10-20p/m) for an unfiltered, static IP based
&gt; &gt; personal service. Most users will not take up this option, but it gives
those
&gt; &gt; that want it the ability to choose, and rewards you with a little extra
money
&gt; &gt; per month for the hassle.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hope this feedback helps ..
