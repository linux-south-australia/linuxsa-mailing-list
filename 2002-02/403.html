&gt; &gt;[1] We have some unconverted space leftover, if anyone would like
&gt; &gt;80-250sqm of CBD 7th floor office with a 100mbit ethernet link to the
&gt; &gt;Internet, yell out :)
&gt; 
&gt; Our, similarly wonderful, dedicated machine room facility (with
&gt; additional unconverted, and available, space, private keycard access,
&gt; the whole nine yards) is on the 8th floor of a CBD building (better
&gt; view :) ).

The 7th floor space is free .. we also have the 11th floor (nyah, nyah)
, but that's full of computers already.
If view makes a difference, maybe we can throw in rooftop keys since we
own that too (best view of skyshow in Adelaide ;) Santos might appear to
be better, but it hurts your neck to look down ;)
 
Did I say own? Adam Internet owns bits of the building its in, so can
offer a lease on any terms (including colocation), not a sublease :)
Wireless afficionados might be interested in the legal benefits of a
true lease of 1x1m of roof space..

&gt; It also has multihomed and path redundant gigabit-per-second
&gt; single-mode fibre links rather than those slow old 100 megabit
&gt; ethernet thingies connecting it to the Internet.

We have physical fibre from 4 different telcos in place, running out in
3 different directions on the compass. It'd be nice to have a local
market that demands gigabit :)
 
&gt; We'll have a second such facility running by the end of the year in a
&gt; different building, too, allowing for true disaster-tolerant
&gt; computing.

Gievn the probabilities of earthquakes and terrorist attacks on downtown
Adelaide, we'll be saving the money and passing on the savings to
customers or reinvesting it into services ;)

&gt; [You started it :) :) ]

Hey, I've sat quietly and listened to you tell everyone here how good
Internode is for months now :)

At least we're both better than &lt;insert national isp/telco here&gt;.
