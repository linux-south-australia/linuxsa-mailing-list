Nope, that pricing and structural shift happened in November. Your 
Telstra rep should do some more research.

That shift is why there are lots of new providers on the streets in 
the last few weeks (take a look at whirlpool).

Those of us who were actually making the effort to be a part of the 
original ACCC action, the action that's lead to all of the 
improvements, have had access to that new pricing since November as a 
part of the settlement process with Telstra.

In March, that pricing just becomes slightly more generally available 
to other wholesale customers of Telstra who choose to go through the 
heartache of establishing themselves as direct Telstra wholesale xDSL 
access customers (and it still -is- painful, but we did it a year 
ago, so that pain is over for us...)

It takes a few months to develop an offering around the new pricing 
because the -structural- shifts are so radical that they take some 
time to assimilate into rational retail pricing models that are 
sustainable for the ISP concerned.

That is why we (and some others around the country) have only 
released their 'home' products in the last few weeks - a lot of work 
has been happening behind the scenes since November, all over the 
country.

So.. I would personally predict a flurry of &lt;nothing&gt; in March, 
followed by some offerings from second tier ISP's around about June. 
But they'll be the same, or more expensive, than the offerings 
released in the last few weeks, because the underlying cost structure 
won't be any different to what the existing players already have.

Besides. If you choose a DSL provider without long term lock-in 
contracts, you have nothing to loose by going with them now. So pick 
anyone other than Telstra, and -move-.

Cheers,
Simon

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I've just been informed by a Telstra rep that fantastic new ADSL
&gt;wholesale pricing will be available in 2-3 weeks time. This means that
&gt;by the end of March, every ISP in the country will be able to offer
&gt;great deals on ADSL, but no-one will be able to give you an exact price
&gt;until *after* the Bigpond February 14th cut-off-contract-without-penalty
&gt;date.
&gt;
&gt;Telstra make no apologies for this poor and convenient (for them)
&gt;timing, so if you want a good deal long term, it might be worth enduring
&gt;the pain of dialup just for a month or two until ADSL becomes
&gt;affordable.
