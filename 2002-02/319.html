Hi There,
    I find that many of these strange brands around are just
other more well known brands with a different badge on them.
You may be able to find out which manufacturer made it by
doing the old serial number in the search engine trick. Just
pick your favourite search engine (I find Yahoo or AltaVista
work best), and plug in EVERY serial number you can find on
the machine, docos or box it comes in and see what pops up.
You may be pleasantly surprised. I am sure that if you
explain to the vendor why you are doing it (to see if you
can install Linux on it) and that if you can, then you will
probably buy it, they will help you out (Many of them want a
sale more than being difficult about it). In my experience,
if a vendor is difficult about it then forget about after
sales service (since you are getting no before sales service
anyhow).

    Method two is do what you have done and post to the
Linux lists and see if anyone can help out. (I'm trying to
help after all).

    Method three - take the plunge and buy the Laptop and
install an intelligent installer distribution of Linux (like
Suse). This may work on the principle that most Laptops are
made of standard parts and so distributions like Suse don't
just look at the Machine BIOS and say HUH?, they actually
look at the individual parts and work from them. Be warned
that some distributions are not that intelligent. Any
distribution that expects you to hand detect hardware and
set it up will be useless to you unless you like banging
your head against a wall. As an example, I tried Redhat 7.1,
Mandrake 7.0 and Suse 7.1 on my laptop (a Toshiba) and had a
hard time on the first two and had to hand set up lots of
stuff and download things etc. Suse set everything up except
my network card (which was an add on anyhow) and I had
little trouble setting up the network card in the end
anyhow.

    Linux Distributions are getting better everyday as I am
sure you probably already know, so also try the latest
version of your distribution, whatever it is. I wouldn't be
too concerned about "but I like distribution X" because
underneath most distributions are 99% the same anyhow. It is
usually only the bells and whistles that make a difference,
and in this particular case you actually WANT the bells and
whistles. I hope this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Linux on Highlander laptops?


&gt; Hi -
&gt;
&gt; I'm looking for a laptop fast enough to run win4lin, so
that I can finally
&gt; be completely windows-free. The best deal I've seen so far
is a P3-1Ghz,
&gt; 20gb, 256mb with modem/net/dvd for $2200. The thing is,
it's a
&gt; 'Highlander'. Has anybody used this brand of laptop? Does
linux run well on them?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Gwyn.
