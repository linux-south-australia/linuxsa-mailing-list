Hi Mark,

&gt;&gt; Beats me!  It's not like you don't have an alternative, after all.

Yes, it often is. If you want your bills on time and up to date with 
the latest calls listed then you subscribe to Telstra. If you don't 
mind being billed in Feberuary for calls you may have made back in 
November or even October then go with anybody else. Telstra are woeful 
in providing billing information to other providers. Sure they give the 
info, they just don't do it in a timely fashion.

Having sufferd from this for 2 years with dingoblack (as my ISP and 2 
home phones) and then also having to put up with staff who won't listen 
when describing a problem and refuse to call supervisors even when they 
could easily be sued for their wrongful behaviour. An accounting sytem 
that has a problem with the digits between 0 and 9 etc. Maybe like me 
you would have walked back to telstra too. You just get to the point 
where at least the devil you know ...

I hate Telstra but at least my bills come in on time and I know just 
what I will be paying for.

It would be great if they provided some sort of service to wholesale 
clients, sadly that doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon.

Until Telstra get out of hogging the last mile I will have to put up 
with Telstra.

That is my story, others may have a different take on this.

Sorry if this is way off topic, I thought that most of us have an 
interest in how we connect to the internet and how to do more for less 
&lt;sigh&gt;

Cheers, Ian.
