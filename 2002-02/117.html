Hi.

Although I am currently unable to avail myself of this service (near-hills
location), It occurs to me that it might be worth adding a teensy weensy
more configurability on the optional firewall by allowing the user to
select which ports are in and which are out. For instance, it might be
desirable to allow mail, but deny the rest.

If this is already an option please say so, I haven't read the pdf's and I
haven't seen this mentioned.

How about wireless? I think I may have line of sight..

Michael

&gt; 
&gt; If you flip this issue around on itself, you'll see why I think that 
&gt; the -option- of firewalling the connection will be very popular for 
&gt; less educated and worldly-wise people than your good self.
&gt; 
&gt; The piece I missed initially was making it optional. We've fixed that 
&gt; in response to a number of very sensible pieces of feedback on the 
&gt; matter from this list.
&gt; 
&gt; For those who elect to use the filter when we provide it, we'll be 
&gt; using it to protect those less educated users than you from all sorts 
&gt; of things they don't want to know about and won't appreciate (being 
&gt; broken into; getting a huge unexpected bill).
&gt; 
&gt; Customers who use our filtering won't be charged for packets we block.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Perhaps a bit of clarification about the idle and 18 hour timeout would
&gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt;appreciated though. Why? If I'm on DHCP, not using bandwidth etc how is
&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt;a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Its really more about being up front with our rotation rate, unlike 
&gt; other ADSL providers who don't even disclose how long they'll hold an 
&gt; address up for.
&gt; 
&gt; Since you're obviously savvy on dynamic dns frobs etc, you will 
&gt; obviously just set up a script to reconnect/reconfigure things when 
&gt; needed, so you're not going to even notice the 18 hour rotation of IP 
&gt; address.
&gt; 
&gt; These things are partially there to protect less educated people than 
&gt; you, for whom its far safer to have their computer disconnect from 
&gt; the 'net if they go on holiday for a week and leave their computer 
&gt; on, than it is to leave it online indefinitely.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember we're trying to cater to a community far wider than just LinuxSA here.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I love the standby dialup!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So given the above, I'm in!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you!
&gt; 
&gt; Simon
