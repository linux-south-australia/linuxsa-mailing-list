It's three months, Nik.  That's all.

 &gt; and you are limiting all 'server functions' by blocking the main ports
 &gt; used.. so we cant use web/mail/ssh/sftp etc??
 &gt; isnt only dynamic IP limiting enough?

Well, no -- People on dynamic IP addresses can still be used as spam
relays, they can still be attacked by Nimda, they can still be brilliantly
effective DDoS amplifiers once they've been BackOrificed, they can still
be 0wn3d due to IIS bugs, etc.

The experience we've had with our other ADSL services is that the only
way most home users have of determining that something like that has
happened is when they get an enormous excess bill at the end of the
month, after their ADSL circuit has been running flat-chat for several
weeks.

What else would you have us do?  We can't bury our heads in the sand;  
Quite aside from the exposure that'd result for our customers, it'd also
make us irresponsible network citizens.

We've provided alternatives for the common servers (Web, SMTP).  Where
we haven't provided an alternative you're free to run the server on a
different port (e.g., FTP).  We don't have a "no servers" limitation,
we have a "we're trying our best to prevent you from being abused" feature.
