&gt; I thought (but could be completely wrong) that the Sony Viao (or
&gt; whatever) laptops had them...

AFAICR Sony has used them in a Japanese only model, but no-one has
adopted them into a device for the US/rest-of-world market.  Transmeta
themselves made some announcement in the past 6 months that they were
going to release a web pad or similar device due to te slow uptake by
manufacturers that had existing Intel contracts.  Don't think it's been
released.  Part of the reason (IMHO) is that plethora of StrongARM based
Linux PDAs out there now.  Slightly overlapping and overpopulated market
now.

I am dumb - most of the time I'm playing smart.
