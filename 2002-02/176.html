you talking telecoms? or in general?
I do it all the time.  I notice lots of places these days have a
clause saying something to the effect that you can change whatever
T&C you like but it has no effect unless agreed to in writing by
us.  I personally don't hold with that, the bit of paper(s) I sign
accepting a quote etc is _the_ contract between us.

Most places are happy with my changes, eg. a new kitchen we had
done recently, I crossed out all the bits about if I haven't paid
them within x days then they can come and break and enter my house
and take it all back.  I understand what they're trying to protect
themselves against (non-paying customers) so I changed it to say
that all only applies if I haven't paid and have not disputed
any of the materials or work done etc, cos if it's not finished
properly (or what I ordered) I'm not paying until it is.
The kitchen mob had no problem with my changes, they are a small
company (who did a good job by the way, and whom I've paid in full!).

I used do it with credit applications too (eg. credit cards) before
they had the privacy stuff in there I used to add a clause saying
I expressly refuse permission for any of my details to be released
outside the credit provider excepting the clauses about credit
checks etc.  I don't know if this ever had any effect but the idea
was they would flag me on their system as someone not to send junk
mail or phone calls to.

Dave.
