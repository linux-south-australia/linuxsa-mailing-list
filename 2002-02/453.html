Hi all, 

One of my friends recently had his 20 GB hdd corrupted when hot swapping
it in a rack. The drive appears to have a mixture of files from his hdd 
and the one that was in the rack before his. All the files appear to
have
been corrupted. Some have readable names, most have been changed to a 
mixture of random ascii characters. We have tried using sector scanning 
drive recovery software but it has not worked.

A friend of his told him that this was as a result of the computer
(somehow)
overwriting the FAT (which is FAT32) on his drive with the one belonging
to
the other drive (which was no longer plugged in). Is this possible? 
(Win XP was being used during the hot swap) He also told my friend that 
the best chance of retrieving the data was by using a Linux box to mount
the drive and to try copying the files off from there, but didn't give
any
details of how to do so.

1)
 Since the FAT has been corrupted won't Linux display the same results
as XP?

2)
 Is there any possible way of recovering the data on the drive with
Linux?

3)
 Does anyone know of a program for Linux or Windows (pref one for each)
that reads
 the physical surface of the hdd in Hex/Ascii or allows bin/hex/ascii
editing
 of the drive surface itself.


I don't ask for much do I :P

Thanks,
Nathan Millhouse
