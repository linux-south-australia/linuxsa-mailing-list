Simon,

I have looked at your proposed ADSL pricing for home use, and it looks quite 
attractive. I would like to say that I can appreciate the tightrope you are 
probably walking between pricing and cost of service/support issues, and that 
your inital offering is a great start, and will be an excellent replacement 
for people on existing dial up services.

You said in one of your emails to linuxsa:

[1] What I mean here is that some of you have said 'Its wonderful 
except for &lt;x&gt;'. Well, I challenge you to -buy- it from us if we 
address &lt;x&gt; to your satisfaction, without then saying 'Oh, thanks, 
but how about &lt;y&gt;, and -then- I'd like it', and repeating that 
iterative loop until one of us goes barking bad.  Support us, and 
we'll keep listening to your needs.


Well, I will accept that challenge. I am an existing, and relatively 
longstanding, Internode ISDN dial-on-demand customer that *will* be ordering 
_one_ of the ADSL products within the next couple of weeks. Which one is 
still problematic for me. Here is why:


1 .. $90 p/m is probably all I want spend on Internet access. It works out to 
around $1000 p/a, in excess of which getting hard to justify.

2 .. I want to be able to run an SMTP server, Web server, ssh server etc on 
my machine. This is a lot easier if I have a static IP address.

3 .. I want a traffic cap more in the order of 1 - 1.5 GB p/m that 500MB.


On the surface, it sounds like I want the business service, but with a higher 
cap, or a lower price ! Just like any services - you can have high speed, 
good quality and low price - pick any two ! 


So that is probably what I will go with - the business service. But if you 
want to make me a really happy customer, you could think about one of these:


1 .. Increase the cap on the $89 business service plan, even 500MB -&gt; 750MB 
would probably be enough to sway me.

2 .. Let me pay extra (say $10-20p/m) for an unfiltered, static IP based 
personal service. Most users will not take up this option, but it gives those 
that want it the ability to choose, and rewards you with a little extra money 
per month for the hassle.


Hope this feedback helps ..
