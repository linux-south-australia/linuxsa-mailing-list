Mark!!

&gt; What else would you have us do?  We can't bury our heads in the sand;
&gt; Quite aside from the exposure that'd result for our customers, it'd also
&gt; make us irresponsible network citizens.

give an option to those clever enough to
a) not use IIS (after all this is a linux list!!)
b) setup their own protection the option to do so at their end (something
like smoothwall) and take the responsibility of security themselves maybe??

&gt; We've provided alternatives for the common servers (Web, SMTP).
 Where
&gt; we haven't provided an alternative you're free to run the server on a
&gt; different port (e.g., FTP).  We don't have a "no servers" limitation,
&gt; we have a "we're trying our best to prevent you from being abused"
feature.

granted we can change ports etc, but as Mark Mills said, port 25 is a
problem

don't get me wrong, I already use internode ADSL at work and have been for
months and we enjoy the service (particularly the lack of contract) and
that's who I want to go with for ADSL, but that doesn't mean I cannot
express my disappointment as I have been asking about this since it was
first mentioned on linuxsa (before Christmas)

and with regards to the contract, what is the problem with dont pay, dont
get service.. to me thats simple considering you would be paying up front
(except extra data fees)

also I am also unaware of your links with Internode.?! ( a lot of we've's in
the email! :)

nik [tm]

heh - irresponsible network citizens??!! is this a foundation I am unaware
of?? (I can see it now, "you let someone hack the wu-ftp server, you
irresponsible network citizen you! :)
