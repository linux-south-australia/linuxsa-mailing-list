A little while back I had some offers from members of this list to 
speak to the young people presently going through our Youth & IT 
project at Salisbury North.

A spot has just turned up for this Thursday, 28th February to speak to 
the kids while they look at pathways into the IT industry. I am not 
sure if this is for the morning (10 to 12:30) or the afternoon session 
(3:30 to 6) but that can be confirmed on Monday.

Each class is of 4 or 5 young people who have already made progress 
through their ICDL training and need to get some idea what lies ahead 
of them.

If you are able to make the time free and are willing to talk to these 
young people at their level the Project would love to hear from you.

Email me off list or call me on 8281 2606.

Cheers, Ian
