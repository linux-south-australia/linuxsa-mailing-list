&gt;This is still a huge change in approach though, is it not?  
&gt;Well, I for 
&gt;one will have to use OpenOffice in future instead of Star.  

Only if you're not willing to pay for any software at all, period.

Personally I'd be one of the first to go out and buy a copy, obviously
depending on cost, but I can't see them charging $600++ like certain 
other Office suites.  For the functionality you get it would be worth
paying say $100 for it, I don't have a problem with that, when I do 
complain is when people are expected to pay 50% of what their computer
is worth for a suite of programs, doesn't compute with my small brain 
capacity.............

Going by my brief looks at both the beta version and the Openoffice 
development I think the idea of Linux desktops in business/corporate 
environments is getting closer to reality.  (Of course for small business
you still have issues such as Quickbooks/MYOB, but for a lot of corporate
environments where office/mail/internet is the primary concern.......)
