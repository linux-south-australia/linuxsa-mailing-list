&gt; &gt; However, do you think it's possible to get such a service at a fixed

&gt; 
&gt; This is my problem exactly, I want pretty close to what you want.  I'm 
&gt; willing to pay a (reasonable) premium for a fixed IP(s) and am even willing 
&gt; to provide the address space myself.  But, I'm not willing to pay five times 
&gt; as much per megabyte as a premimum.

yep me too, ditto, ditto etc
 
&gt; Simon, 
&gt; How about a service which is a cross between the two types of plans, but 
&gt; with the restriction that it's delivered purely to a residential street 
&gt; address?  

he's had enough people giving him those kind of ideas (if he hadn't
already thought of them) so that if he had wanted to he'd have 
done it by now, but has chosen to stick with the home vs business
type plans and that's it, which obviously I don't agree with, but
it's your ISP Simon and my hard luck!

Which leaves me with a crappy continuously redialing modem link or
a BPD perm modem and satellite downlink - which is not a bad solution
and reasonably priced but a simple ADSL link would have been neater
and probably better.

Dave.
