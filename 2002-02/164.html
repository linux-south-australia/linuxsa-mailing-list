So true, you won't get anything via the TIO until you tackle the main problem.

Even then, you have to do it right, do as Mark suggests, ask to go up the
ladder, be politely insistent. But above all Document it, date of call, who,
why etc. This will be the difference. Worked with Tesltra for me.

&gt;  &gt; Maybe it's time the TIO was brought into the picture on Hell$tra.
&gt;
&gt; The TIO is an office of *last* resort.
&gt;
&gt; Step one would surely be to /read/ the contract you signed, see what
&gt; it says about cancellations, and determine whether Telstra is following
&gt; it to the letter.
&gt;
&gt; If they are following it to the letter, the TIO's response will be,
&gt; "No, sorry, they're doing exactly what you agreed they should do,"
&gt; and you will have wasted your time.
&gt;
&gt; If they're not following it to the letter, you take it up with Telstra
&gt; first (if you don't get any joy from the person you talk to, ask to
&gt; talk to their superior, and keep going until they won't let you talk
&gt; to any other superiors).  If you fail to do that before you go to the
&gt; TIO, the TIO's answer will be, "Customer has not given Telstra the
&gt; opportunity to settle the issue internally, therefore there is not
&gt; yet any cause for adjudication."
&gt;
&gt; This all gets back to why it's so important to read the terms and
&gt; conditions which govern any Internet access supply:  A lot of people
&gt; seem to sign contracts which can be boiled down to, "The Supplier
&gt; Is Permitted To Do Something You Hate," then they get irate when
&gt; the supplier actually /does/ something they hate.
