Hi all...

I was just discussing with a friend some techniques for keeping large
backups online, and remembered Union File Systems... I believe FreeBSD
does these nicely, but, for reasons involving other software, Linux is
required in this situation -- does anyone know of how close union fs's
are for Linux? Is there a core project out there? Is anyone willing to
pay for it to be done?

I've done some brief searching around, and have come across something
called IFS (Inherited File System) and TFS (Translucent File System --
Sun) ... But not real sure what the status is on these...

Also, in this specific instance, the idea that I have running around in
my head is pretty specific... I'd want:

Say four complete backups, that look like live filesystems, but are
mounted read-only for users...

Eg:

/thisweek
/lastweek
/theweekbefore
/theweekbeforethat

Then within each of these, there would be a directory for the backup of
each day:

/weekend (full, done on sat or sun)
/monday
/tuesday
/wednesday
/thursday
/friday

Monday through to Friday would be effectively incremental backups, but
mounted on top of weekend (or on top of all the previous days), so they
look like full FS's.

The idea would be that once per week, you could do a dump/restore (or
tar c/tar x or etc) to create the weekly backup, and then every night,
use rsync, dump, or whatever, to create the difference filesystems...
After this, they could all be read-only, as you specifically wouldn't
want to change anything anyway...

So it doesn't really need to be a proper live union FS, just one that I
can create, then have read-only...

Of course, one option that I thought of was Katie, but I don't know if
it's production ready yet, and it may be too slow to use on hundred MB
plus fs's...

Comments?
