Are you using devfs (eg mandrake 8.1, and possibly others)? I have
problems with it creating the symlinks from /dev/cdrom to where ever the
cdrom is. Normally I work around it by using /dev/cdrom&lt;number&gt; where
number is the device the cdrom has picked up today :( Do an ls -al
/dev/cdrom and I suspect you'll see its a broken sym-link. If this is
the case rm it, and re-create to the correct device.

&gt; Seems there are a few pointers towards cdbakeoven, so I've downloaded the 
&gt; lates version (rpm) from sourceforge, and installed.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to be recognising both drives.  In the CD-Copy Dialog, hitting the 
&gt; 'detect' button gives the following:
&gt; 
&gt; /dev/hdc Sony-RW CRX1611	Driver: ide-scsi	SCSI: n/a
&gt; /dev/hdd LG CD-ROM CRD08522B	Driver: ide-cdrom	SCSI: n/a
&gt; /dev/scd0 Sony-RW CRX1611	Driver: n/a	SCSI: [00,00,00]
&gt; 
&gt; Options selected in CD-Copy Dialog have included:
&gt; 	Source: LG CDROM  (nb this is /mnt/cdrom2)
&gt; 	Destination: Sony CD-RW (nb this is /mnt/cdrom)
&gt; 	Recording Details: Test & Burn
&gt; 	CD Type: Music
&gt; 
&gt; Hitting button in CD-Copy Dialog "Preview" brings up the response: "CDROM 
&gt; read or access error (or no disc in drive).  Please make sure you have access 
&gt; permissions to /dev/cdrom".
&gt; 
&gt; This is happening whether I try to burn as a root user, or as an ordinary 
&gt; user.  There is definitely a disk in each of the CD-ROM and CD-RW drives.  So 
&gt; I have attempted to change permissions for /dev/cdrom please ?  In shell as 
&gt; root user, I have typed "chmod 777 /dev/cdrom" but the response is "chmod: 
&gt; getting attributes of '/dev/cdrom': No such file or directory"   Then if I 
&gt; type "mkdir: /dev/cdrom", I get the response "mkdir: cannot create directory 
&gt; '/dev/cdrom': File exists."  
&gt; 
&gt; Also in CD-Copy Dialog, if I click "Burn" and hit "Copy!", then I get the 
&gt; folowing response: "Chosen directory does not have enough space available for 
&gt; storing disk image.  Please choose another location!"  Mmmmm.  It's just a 
&gt; very short music CD, so there shouldn't be a problem with there being too 
&gt; little space on the destination CD.  Any clues what's going on here ? 
&gt; 
&gt; Clicking OK on the above message, closes it, but viewing the Elapsed Time in 
&gt; Process Output, shows the timer operating (as if doing the copy).  
&gt; Nevertheless, there's no activity from the drives.  
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew
