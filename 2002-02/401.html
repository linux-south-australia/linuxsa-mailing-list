&gt; Ahem.

D'you have a cough or something, John? :-)

&gt; Since ISP and business chatter seems to have been accepted by the list
&gt; through silence, I'd like to say that I take exception to this opinion.

Feel free.

&gt; I work for Adam Internet, who have been doing online services since
&gt; 1986.

Yup, and I know that they do a good job of it, too.

&gt; 6 months ago, we opened "Adelaide Network Access Point" (Adnap) as a
&gt; colocation facility to provide a new home for Adam's servers [1]. A year
&gt; in planning, the mission was to create the best possible location to run
&gt; our Internet business from. It turned out that we got it right, and the
&gt; quality and value were such that 10 other ISP's have moved in or are
&gt; buying services from it.

I heard about that.

&gt; Adam Internet does support it's linux and BSD customers, and uses open
&gt; source software extensively throughout its network. It also contributes
&gt; patches to open source projects, and has some projects derived from
&gt; internal software on sourceforge.

Look, I'm not saying that Adam doesn't support the OpenSource community
and customers. I think Adam are great -- one of the few ISPs that I'd
put in the "worthy of my business" basket. As you may have noticed,
Internode live in the basket too, but ISPs like CCA and Telstra don't.

I've not seem Adam doing really cool things the way Internode do,
though. The Internode/Agile people have developed really nice products
and they listen and -act on- feedback they get from their customers.

That's not to say that other ISPs (including Adam) don't, but Internode
are at the forefront, or so it appears.

&gt; I don't believe it's my place to say if we're better or worse than
&gt; Internode, but competition is tight and either way I don't believe the
&gt; adjective 'helluva' is warranted.

Well, I do. Compared to many of the ISPs that we could have chosen to
provide our Internet access, a partnership with Internode/Agile is that
much better for us.

They provide more than just data services too, meaning that when our
hands are untied, we can (potentially) run voice services with them too.

I also like the fact that Simon is on this list, listens and also
participates in discussions that are not related to Internode, too. The
fact that he personally listens and responds to comments and requests is
something that I don't see happening from some other ISPs.

I stand by my original assertion. If you don't agree, that's fine.
You're allowed to, as I'm sure you're aware.
