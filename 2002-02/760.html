Confound!

&gt; &gt; a) the person who sent the e-mail originally
&gt; &gt; b) whoever my "reply" goes to
&gt; &gt; c) the list
&gt; 
&gt; Personal preference!

I gave you my opinion about this list. I wasn't commenting on personal
preferences specifically...

&gt; &gt; Greg Lehey, for example, specifically looks for his name being in the
&gt; &gt; to/cc/bcc list. If it isn't you can still guarantee he'll see the
&gt; &gt; message but he may prioritise differently than you'd intended.
&gt; 
&gt; Just so long as he doesn't prioritise it straight into the rubbish bin, I'm
&gt; happy.

But how can you be sure?

&gt; Since you insist I'll do so (for you), though I personally dislike getting
&gt; the same message twice especially as it eats into my meagre data buffer. It
&gt; doesn't take long to use up 200Mb & I can't afford to do anything about it
&gt; (yet!)  Besides which, one of the benefits of an email list, is being able
&gt; to send to one address.

Oh please. Any person (I would use a stronger term but the last time I
mentioned nuclear, America, Twin Towers, Plane all my e-mails just
DISAPPEARED) knows that subscribing to a mailing list will, ahem,
generate extra mail.

As far as I am concerned, too bad. Get an ISP that doesn't limit you to
such a limit. That's a USER problem. And it's certainly not mine. Not
mine at all. Period. 

DSL

(1) I am happy to write a perl/awk/postscript program that determines
the number of bytes taken by this e-mail and its header, and fill this
e-mail with sufficient cryptographically secure CRAP to make it up to
200Mb.

(2) This is ABSOLUTLY feasible. Don't tempt me.
