&gt; BUT SERIOUSLY,  what are the best moves for the GOV or industry to
improve
&gt; it broadband situation.
&gt; My brother pays equiv of $55/per month for a 4meg DSL line..  NO limits.
&gt; Why the hell cant we get that ?,  Cant we just privatise Telstra and let
&gt; lots more carriers move in and offer more competative pricing and
&gt; flexibility?.

It is called "Economies of Scale".

Deregulation is not the answer, take the mobile phone industry for example.
Deregulation has lead to the creation of five mobile phone carriers, one
has gone belly up, one more is finacially sick, we will be back to three
shortly.   We are a country of 17Million people, there are over 280Million
in the EU, Hmm nearly 16 times what we have here.  If we took what we
currently pay and divided it by 16 then it would be cheap in comarison.

ISP/Broadband pipe infrastructure is not cheap, we are 17Million people
over 7Million Square kilometers, fibre is not cheap to run around the
place, there has to be some sort of cost recovery on Hardware Infrastructre
investment, additional costs.

Comparing English ADSL with Oz ADSL is like comparing Apples and Oranges.

&gt; do I have to get out my big stick !!!

This wont do any good, the pricing we are seeing for ADSL for the size and
number of people in our country is adequate.  Yes we would all like to see
pricing fall but be realistic, comparing English/Swedish/EU ADSL with that
on offer here in our contry is like comparing Apples and Oranges, Italian
Ferrari's and Russian Travies.
