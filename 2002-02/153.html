Quoting tim truman &lt;<A HREF="mailto:timtruman@bigpond.com">timtruman@bigpond.com</A>&gt;:

&gt; does anyone out there know of or work for a company based in adelaide that
&gt; uses C.
SE-Net do (or at least did in Oct 2001), but I'm not sure whether they're
looking for employees at the moment.

&gt; i also have a basic knowledge of Java, Cobol & (dare i mention it) VB and
&gt; quite a few other aspects of the IT industry.
Ah. You studied IT at Adelaide TAFE or similar, right? If so, did you have
Tim Burgess as your C lecturer?

&gt; i am quite prepared to do work experience just to get a foot in the door (and
&gt; avoid the dreaded help desk option).
It's not that bad. You'll get much-needed experience in the industry, you'll
be in touch with the goings on in the ISP world, and acquire many other
useful pieces of information and skills necessary for getting a job which
doesn't mean that you have to communicate with customers.

Besides, it's better than being unemployed, making burgers, or stocking
shelves.

Anyway, if you're looking for a job which involves C programming under an
Open Source operating system, I've a few pointers for you:

 o Write an Open Source program. You've got no prior professional experience,
   so employers are going to want some sort of assurance that you know what
   you're doing. The program's source is public, so a potential employer
   can easily download the source and see what your style is like.
   Obviously, his tactic requires much effort and will only help when the
   person reviewing your resume is technically minded and has time to spare
   looking at your work. It's more of an on-going hobby rather than a way to
   get a job, but it will improve your skill.

 o Hang about on local lists like this one. In the last two months I've seen
   two part-time or casual job offers. You'll also be able to meet people who
   already have high-level jobs at local companies, and many positions in
   smaller companies are filled by word of mouth rather than a recruiter or
   newspaper advertisements.

 o Stop using HTML email unless the employer asks for it. In some technically
   minded communities, it reflects badly on your knowledge of the Internet.
   In others, nobody really cares, but better safe than sorry.

 o Follow job application instructions. If the employer asks for a
   hand-written application on green paper or even that you post your resume
   as a Word document, do so. Sometimes it's more a test of whether you can
   follow instructions rather than an employer's preference. This is one of
   those points that _seems_ obvious until you hear of an employer throwing
   out half of the applications because they were submitted as Word
   documents rather than RTF.

Kirrily Robert (Skud) wrote a great article on this subject, but I can't find
it anymore. Damn.
