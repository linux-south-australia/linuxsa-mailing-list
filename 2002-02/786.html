&gt;if some one doesn't want to put in a positive contribution,
&gt;and just criticises peoples spelling, grammar and obvious
&gt;typos that they might refrain from harsh judgement,
&gt;look at the content and respond to the meaning of a post.

I agree - without wanting to be too pedantic, there's really no need to
publically pick apart someone's language skills unless they're that poor
that they totally obscure the meaning of the message the person is trying to
convey.

&gt;If a user post to this list in HTML then they probably aren't
&gt;aware of the accepted practices here, they may also not know
&gt;how to turn of HTML in there client, it may also be fair to
&gt;assume that some one who needed guidance at that level also
&gt;might not know that the archives exist let alone how to search
&gt;them.
&gt;I beleive it doesn't hurt to be nice even to an newbie.

OK, here starts the pedantry :)

There's not necessarily a correlation between being a Linux Newbie and
having a lack of technical aptitude.

In fact, in my limited experience the people who choose to use Linux aren't
usually complete turnips at all - for one thing, they will have usually
already assessed Windoze and decided that it doesn't meet their needs.  This
is based on the pretense that most new retail PC's are sold with Windoze
preinstalled, excepting those which are set up for other people by real
Linux enthusiasts.  However it takes a certain amount of savvy to
successfully make one's way through a Linux install (although decreasingly
so as improvements happen, so prepare for greater numbers of turnips to jump
ship...), so I'd venture a guess that if they're intelligent enough to do
that then they can certainly search a website archive.

The mailing list info page states "HTML posts may be ignored and are usually
not well accepted." (and then contradicts itself further down the page), so
there's no definitive statement that says "Thou shalt not post HTML"...  If
it's that disagreeable, either insist that the list moderator/administrator
filter out HTML mailings, or go join a list which does.

OK, that's enough out of me.

I just wanted to see my name in print anyway...

Jason =)
