&gt; What does privatizing Telstra have to do with it?  Personally I think
&gt; that'd be one of the /worst/ outcomes:  At least they currently have 
&gt; to put up the pretense of community service;  The only motive they'd
&gt; have if they were 100% privately owned would be profit.
&gt; 
&gt; /Then/ you'd see their monopolistic tendencies come to the fore...

However, at the moment you have a big problem and that is the Government has 
two rolls: one as owner of Telstra second as regulator.  Because they have 
conflicting rolls we end up that because they want to sell Telstra soon 
they're happy to allow Telstra to run up big profits at the moment (jacking 
up prices, reducing spending) to get the best price for it later.

At least if they sold it off they'd be happier to regulate it more closely.

Not that ultimately I think that'd work either, I think they need to divide 
Telstra into separate companies - eg. longhaul (interstate), local (eg. last 
mile copper, local loop etc) and services (internet, switching, etc) - this 
would allow companies to buy services more easily from Telstra where it has 
a true monopoly (local loop) and compete more sucessfully in others (eg. 
internet).

However, we get back to the problem that the Govt is the owner and wants to 
maximise sale price and so won't break it up because it'd reduce the sell 
price.
