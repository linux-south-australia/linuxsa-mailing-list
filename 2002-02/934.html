Also try changing the parity settings on the tape and/or the scsi bus.
How long is your scsi cable? Do you have an active or passive
terminator? (hint: the passives look normal, the actives often have an
LED on them, or say "LVD" or have some other indicator). Long cables
with passive terminators can create intermittent problems. If this is
the case an active terminator might fix them. 

Also, speaking of LVD, Im guessing that it is not an LVD device. If this
is the case, make sure you dont have it plugged in to an LVD scsi plug.
I once mixed the two and got a hdd that I could only access the first
50mb or so of the disk and then it'd lock up. Sounds very similar...

&gt; Well, a "mt -f /dev/st0 erase" worked without any obvious problems!.
&gt; 
&gt; I've tried upgrading to the latest kernel and the problem still exists
&gt; although now it just hangs rather than asking for the next tape.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm stumped as I'm no expert on scsi hardware. is there anything that I
&gt; should try to work out where the problem is being caused? the drive is
&gt; pretty much new so it shouldn't be broken!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And it is getting part way through the first file (which is 
&gt; &gt; about 50MB),
&gt; &gt; &gt; giving an IO error and then asking for the next volume! ^C 
&gt; &gt; at this point
&gt; &gt; &gt; kills the tar but leaves the SCSI bus locked so that I 
&gt; &gt; can't remove a tape
&gt; &gt; &gt; from either the DDS4 drive or the DLT drive. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the backup machine is running RH7.2 so is there any known SCSI
&gt; &gt; &gt; issues with RH7.2? is it possible that it is a problem with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; tape? is it possible to "reinitialise" a tape?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I had a similar problem with a Sony DDS4 tape drive and had to take it
&gt; &gt; back get repaired.  Did the problem just start recently or has it been
&gt; &gt; that way since you installed the drive?  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Try reloading the SCSI card modules.  That should reset the bus and
&gt; &gt; allow you to unload the tape.
