THey have some upsides..
For instance, you can plug the USB mouse directly into the keyboard, thus
avoiding some excess cabling. Some PCs and monitors have front-mounted USB
plugs too, which in some arrangements can reduce cable mess.

Also, USB keyboards allegedly don't suffer from the inability to work with
some combinations of keys. (This is something gamers care about.. most
normal people wouldn't mind nor notice that once you press, for eg, LCtrl,
LShift, Z, S, W and space simultaneously something gets lost. ;) )

Also, USB keyboards shouldn't suffer from the problem of not working when
you unplug and replug them. PS/2 and AT/DIN style keyboards frequently get
stuffed up if you plug them into a hot system. So, if you have a pile of
headless machines, and just have a single monitor and keyboard (but no KVM
switch), then usb would be better for you.

And lastly, I believe you can do away with the keyboard interrupt! Yay ;)
(Not sure if current motherboards support this though?)
It sucks having only 0xf interrupts, and having so many of them taken up by
legacy devices. (eg. com1, com2, keyboard, ps/2 mouse, printer port)

Next time i buy a new keyboard, I will get a USB version.

hope this helps,

&gt; Hi.
&gt;
&gt; I'm looking at a buying a new keyboard, and have always bought DIN-5
&gt; serial (old AT-style) or PS/2 models.  Now that my box supports USB, a
&gt; USB keyboard seems to be a viable option.
&gt;
&gt; I'm wondering if there's any drawbacks to having a USB keyboard.  For
&gt; instance, is the keyboard supported from boot, or do I have to wait
&gt; until USB support is initialized on my system (usually FreeBSD or Linux)
&gt; before the keyboard can be used?  If I remember correctly, my BIOS has
&gt; an option to enable USB keyboard support, but I'm skeptical whether this
&gt; is merely for the BIOS or for the entire boot process.  If it's not
&gt; available for the first few stages of booting, is this likely to cause
&gt; any problems (e.g. selecting a boot option at the boot loader)?
&gt;
&gt; Is there any other non-obvious reason why I might not choose a USB
&gt; keyboard?  Conversely, is there any reason why a USB keyboard might be
&gt; preferred over a PS/2 keyboard (perhaps for the builtin USB hubs if
&gt; they're good)?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any advice.
&gt;
