Perhaps you need to read this:

"New features that are just now starting to be found in KVM units are USB and audio switching.
Support for USB can take a couple of different forms. One technology of USB KVM switching
allows the user to support USB Keyboard and USB pointing devices. The other technology allows
the user to not only support the switching of USB keyboards and USB pointing devices, but
also allows the sharing of other USB devices that might be plugged into the USB port.
You then have the ability to share your USB scanners, USB cameras, USB storage devices and
USB gaming devices between both of your systems. USB support for Apple MAC USB compatible
systems was found in several units. We did not test the KVM's ability to be used in an Apple
MAC USB setup."

ps but I didn't see him mention that he wanted to use a keyboard with a KVM switch ?

isplis:&gt;&gt;KVM switches that support USB keyboards are rare at this point in time, and
isplis:&gt;&gt;you might want to check that they're compatable with DOS boot disks for
isplis:&gt;&gt;things like BIOS upgrades. If you have a favourite old dos application that
isplis:&gt;&gt;looks for keyboard scan codes, it *might* be affected.
