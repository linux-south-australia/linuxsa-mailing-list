Hi guys -- I'm almost finished installing too many OS's on my laptop,
and I thought I'd write some notes on how I did it... They are from
memory, and are not complete (and nor am I -- I'm still at step 13
below, but hope the rest is easy :)

Feel free, ye who are interested, to take a read, and see if you can
correct me, or contribute, or just form a negative opinion of me based
on this shoddy piece of workmanship...

Notes on setting up Toshiba TE2000 Laptop with Windows XP Pro, RedHat
7.2, FreeBSD 4.5 and Solaris 8.

1.	Install Windows XP using standard Toshiba install CDs (or just
start with how it came from the factory). It's advisable not to install
other software here, because if things go wrong later, which they most
likely will, you may have to start again. ~1 hour
2.	Use Partition Magic 7 (or your favourite NTFS-capable fs and
partition shrinker - I don't think there's any free ones worth trusting)
to shrink the Windows XP NTFS partition to around 6Gb, rather than the
default 18Gb (the entire drive). ~30 mins
3.	Use Linux' fdisk to partition the rest of the disk as follows:
hda1	NTFS (Windows XP)
hda2	DOS Extended (for Linux)
hda3	BSD
hda4	Solaris - with a few cylinders gap on either side
Don't worry about the Linux partitions at this stage -- most linuces
will install in logical partitions quite happily, so you will create
hda5-n within hda2 later.
Also note that it's important to leave a few cylinders gap before and
after the Solaris partition - the Solaris fdisk is very painful, and is
likely to break your partition table, or insist that you have
overlapping partitions when you don't. There may be a more sensible
workaround to this, but I am not aware of it. ~10 mins
4.	Install FreeBSD 4.4 (well, that's the CDs I had), taking care to
install it on /dev/ad0s3 - the third DOS slice on the first IDE disk. It
can do its own partitioning thing from there. Install the minimum - at
this stage, you just want to make sure everything boots and is workable,
then worry about spending the time installing and/or compiling more
software. (then again, you probably want to get the most advantage from
your CDROMs, so you may as well install everything you can, and then use
CVSup later to update it) Stay in text mode, and don't worry about X at
this stage - you'll be compiling and configuring XFree86 4 soon. ~1 hour
5.	Install Solaris 8 by booting from the "Applications CD 1 of 2"
rather than the Install CD. The Install CD uses "WebStart", which has an
even more broken fdisk, and generally won't install all the way. This
one starts a basic X server, taking up a small window in the centre of
your screen. It's annoying, because not only does it make you scroll
within the little window to see the higher virtual resolution, but it
won't let you scroll enough to see all the buttons, so you have to move
windows around to see which button to click, and occasionally are forced
to guess. Again, don't worry about X or extra software - just install
the stuff from the CD, and reboot ~1.5 hours
6.	At each stage here, each OS installs its own bootloader. Win XP
just loads Win XP. FreeBSD's will let you use the F-Keys to select "??"
(Win XP), "FreeBSD" or "??" (the presently empty Solaris partition -
IIRC, it ignores the Extended partition). Solaris will let you choose
any of the primary partitions to boot from. It's quite likely that you
will still be able to boot each OS at each stage, but don't worry if you
can't - GRUB will cure your ills.
7.	Install RedHat (or Debian, or Sorcerer, or whatever, for that
matter - just make sure you can use GRUB). RedHat, if you choose the
graphical install, will also open up an irritatingly small window, like
Solaris. I recommend the text based install. Again, don't worry about X
configuration for now, nor any apps. ~1 hour
8.	Now we come to the GRUBby bit. RedHat, by default, sets GRUB up
to boot whatever it can find - which for me, meant Win XP and RedHat
itself. I don't think it noticed FreeBSD or Solaris. Add lines similar
to the following to your /etc/grub.conf:
other
This is actually quite a delicate operation, and if you get it wrong,
it's quite possible that almost nothing will boot. It's important to at
_least_ get the RedHat bit right (so then you can fix it if the rest is
wrong). Read the GRUB HOW-TO, especially the bit on numbering - it's not
intuitive in any sense of the word. Then run grub-install (I believe
grub-install is deprecated, or not recommended, but I don't know what
else to use - I'm kind of using it like LILO). ~15 minutes (check it,
check it again - use fdisk to ensure you got it right, etc)
9.	Reboot about 8 times - twice per OS - to ensure that it all
works, and that booting one doesn't mess up the other(s). Solaris will
still want to run it's own bootloader, but it's advisable not to try
loading anything else from there. If "stuff" doesn't work as expected,
you're on your own - try messing about with a linuxcare bootable
business card CD, or whatever OS is working, plus the install disks, and
see what you can do. Also note that these notes are written from memory,
and may be wrong - if so, please email me ASAP with your comments and/or
corrections.
10.	For me, network configuration was trivial under all OS's - I
used the standard tools, and it all worked. My Toshiba has a built in
Intel 8225x 10/100 ethernet card, and it's well supported.
11.	Boot RedHat. Install this file
(<A HREF="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/XF86Config-4">http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/XF86Config-4</A>) as /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
to make X work. Personally, I hate configuring X, and the card on my
Toshiba (Trident CyberBlade XP Ai1) is not real well supported under X,
as Trident (or ALi, who I understand now own Trident) won't release
documentation. Test it. Shut down. ~10 mins
12.	Boot FreeBSD. Ensure you are attached to the internet with a
broadband link, which you are not paying for (this takes a long time,
and downloads a lot of data). Run cvsupit (cd /usr/ports/net/cvsupit;
make; make install) and select a local cvsup mirror and the appropriate
version of FreeBSD to track (I chose 4.5-STABLE). Follow the
instructions in the FreeBSD handbook to update (make buildworld, make
buildkernel, make installkernel, make installworld, mergemaster, etc)
your BSD. ~3 hours
13.	Install XFree86 4 on FreeBSD. (cd /usr/ports/x11/Xfree86-4;
make; make install). This is where I am presently up to, but I suspect I
should be able to use pretty much the same config file as above (with
some changes for Linux-&gt;BSD device naming), and it should be OK. ~1 hour
14.	Just to make yourself feel good, boot all your OS's in turn
again.
15.	Boot Something that Works with a browser (or configure your
browser in XP, RH or BSD). go to
<A HREF="http://soldc.sun.com/developer/support/driver/tools/video/video-index.ht">http://soldc.sun.com/developer/support/driver/tools/video/video-index.ht</A>
ml, and read away, printing what you need. Download the XFree86 porting
kit for Solaris 8 intel. Put this file somewhere accessible from your
Solaris installation - It will be hard to download it using Solaris, so
find an FTP server somewhere. If you can't, it is possible to do it with
Solaris, but it's a pain.
16.	Boot Solaris. Get the file from wherever you put it. Follow the
instructions you printed. I suggest using the VESA driver here, as I
don't think the porting kit has support for the Trident card either.
17.	At this stage, once you have tested networking and XFree86 on
each platform, and you can successfully boot whatever you want, take it
to your friends' houses and show them. "oo-er".

Misc notes:
.	This was all written from memory, whilst I was half way through
compiling XFree86 4 on FreeBSD, so it is probably wrong, will probably
render your BIOS unreadable, and make your sister pregnant. Don't blame
me. Especially about your sister - she told me she was on the pill.
.	A lot of this probably applies to other laptops and even
desktops - mainly, the X stuff is laptop-specific, so everything else
should work on any PC.
.	If you have a larger HDD, you could probably install more
Linux's - I would have liked to have had Debian and Sorcerer on it as
well. Simply create more logical partitions within the extended
partition. Solaris, Windows and FreeBSD seem to all demand primary
partitions. Linux is flexible. Take advantage of that flexibility.
.	Back up your data (or just don't have any data, like I did)
before starting. You will very likely lose data willy nilly (which is
far more serious than it sounds).
.	Don't expect any help from Toshiba - they won't want to know,
especially about FreeBSD (FreeWhat?) and Solaris (SolWhat?).
.	Don't expect any help from me - I don't want to know, unless you
pay me or are just pointing out errors in my notes.
.	As for why you would want to run all of the above OS's, well who
knows? Maybe, like me, you need to support all four, and want them
handy.
.	If you wanted to be really cool, you could run VMWare on Linux
(or Windows) and try running other OS's within it. However, some
(Solaris) tend to like their hardware to remain as it was when they were
installed, and VMWare virtualises hardware. I haven't tried it, but I
suspect it wouldn't be that successful - go for the evaluation edition
first.
.	Note also that there's no reason why just because it's all
working now, it will still all be working tomorrow - you may have done
nothing, but when you have four OS's, not really knowing anything about
the others, one or other may just decide that it's going to do something
stupid, and you may lose data - keep it all backed up.
.	Finally, note that the Solaris partition looks like a Linux Swap
partition. RH asked me if I wanted to format it as swap. I have heard of
some linux installs not asking, and just doing. This is bad. AFAIK, you
can get around this by either installing in the opposite order (in which
case, you may end up with the Solaris Boot Block in the MBR, and you'd
rather not have that), or by temporarily changing the type of the
Solaris partition to something innocuous whilst installing Linux. Just
remember to change it back.
