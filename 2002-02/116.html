Would you consider writing some software that regularily tried to attack your own customers and
then send them a report about the findings?  I think if I was sent an email before and after the
"attack"  explaining what was going on, then I would appreciate the effort.

Others however may not like it, but you could consider it a challenge - keep out your ISP :)

anyway, just an idle though this monday morn' when its -10C outside :)

&gt; 
&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I am running wu-ftp on redhat 7.0
&gt; 
&gt; im trying to limit the users to their home directory. the info i have seen
&gt; on the net says changing their entry in the /etc/passwrd file to:
&gt; 
&gt; :/home/joe/ ./:
&gt; 
&gt; ...should fix this, i must be missing something because this doesnt work. i
&gt; have tried other variations as:
&gt; 
&gt; :/home/joe/ ./home/joe: (and a so on...)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; im sure there are people on this list who have come accross this before. i
&gt; would prefer not changing ftp servers though. i've heard its easy to do on
&gt; others. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; Subject: CD burning: read drive not recognised: 3
&gt; 
&gt; Thankyou everyone for your responses so far.
&gt; 
&gt; Seems there are a few pointers towards cdbakeoven, so I've downloaded the 
&gt; lates version (rpm) from sourceforge, and installed.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to be recognising both drives.  In the CD-Copy Dialog, hitting the 
&gt; 'detect' button gives the following:
&gt; 
&gt; /dev/hdc Sony-RW CRX1611	Driver: ide-scsi	SCSI: n/a
&gt; /dev/hdd LG CD-ROM CRD08522B	Driver: ide-cdrom	SCSI: n/a
&gt; /dev/scd0 Sony-RW CRX1611	Driver: n/a	SCSI: [00,00,00]
&gt; 
&gt; Options selected in CD-Copy Dialog have included:
&gt; 	Source: LG CDROM  (nb this is /mnt/cdrom2)
&gt; 	Destination: Sony CD-RW (nb this is /mnt/cdrom)
&gt; 	Recording Details: Test & Burn
&gt; 	CD Type: Music
&gt; 
&gt; Hitting button in CD-Copy Dialog "Preview" brings up the response: "CDROM 
&gt; read or access error (or no disc in drive).  Please make sure you have access 
&gt; permissions to /dev/cdrom".
&gt; 
&gt; This is happening whether I try to burn as a root user, or as an ordinary 
&gt; user.  There is definitely a disk in each of the CD-ROM and CD-RW drives.  So 
&gt; I have attempted to change permissions for /dev/cdrom please ?  In shell as 
&gt; root user, I have typed "chmod 777 /dev/cdrom" but the response is "chmod: 
&gt; getting attributes of '/dev/cdrom': No such file or directory"   Then if I 
&gt; type "mkdir: /dev/cdrom", I get the response "mkdir: cannot create directory 
&gt; '/dev/cdrom': File exists."  
&gt; 
&gt; Also in CD-Copy Dialog, if I click "Burn" and hit "Copy!", then I get the 
&gt; folowing response: "Chosen directory does not have enough space available for 
&gt; storing disk image.  Please choose another location!"  Mmmmm.  It's just a 
&gt; very short music CD, so there shouldn't be a problem with there being too 
&gt; little space on the destination CD.  Any clues what's going on here ? 
&gt; 
&gt; Clicking OK on the above message, closes it, but viewing the Elapsed Time in 
&gt; Process Output, shows the timer operating (as if doing the copy).  
&gt; Nevertheless, there's no activity from the drives.  
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew

&gt; up you'll probably keep it for weeks" ?
&gt; 
&gt; I've had telstra cable broadband for 6 months, and i think i can count the
&gt; IPs i've had on one hand.. i appreciate that. That and the fact its been
&gt; an effectively unlimited cap until last month. ,)

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Toby,
&gt; 
&gt; If you wanted static IP, we have a different product that offers that 
&gt; feature (and several others) over and above the feature set of 
&gt; Personal ADSL.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I know it costs more. It -does- more.
&gt; 
&gt; We ain't Telstra. If you want to keep ripping someone off, stay with 
&gt; Telstra cable, for both our sakes. Really.  They can absorb the 
&gt; fruits of their own stupidity for ages, and the only casualty is 
&gt; their share price (doesn't matter to me, I'm not a shareholder).
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Simon

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I've had telstra cable broadband for 6 months, and i think i can count the
&gt; &gt;IPs i've had on one hand.. i appreciate that. That and the fact its been
&gt; &gt;an effectively unlimited cap until last month. ,)

&gt; &gt;&gt;  so for me, the only problem is the changing IP address each 18 hours.

&gt; 
&gt; DHCP, who cares. If I want static I'll use dyndns or dns2go.
&gt; Port blocking, hmm, but you've said this is optional. I run gnatbox
&gt; firewall with alarms so any server I wish to run is monitored and
&gt; alarmed.
&gt; If I am stupid enough to run an always on (more later!) broadband link
&gt; to the net without some sort of security, then I deserve every cent of
&gt; the
&gt; invoice presented to me for being an idiot.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps a bit of clarification about the idle and 18 hour timeout would
&gt; be
&gt; appreciated though. Why? If I'm on DHCP, not using bandwidth etc how is
&gt; that
&gt; a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I love the standby dialup! 
&gt; 
&gt; So given the above, I'm in!
&gt; 
&gt; /stand on soapbox
&gt; 
&gt; I have been with Tel$tra for over four years. I have watched, with
&gt; envy, the rollouts of broadband choices presented to the real Australia,
&gt; ie the eastern seaboard. Up until a few months ago I was content to 
&gt; put up with my ADSL connection and pay the (what I consider outrageous)
&gt; bucks.
&gt; Then the the 3GB cap. That did not affect me (I average ~1GB) but the
&gt; fact that I had to sign an 18 month contract which imposed penalties if
&gt; my situation changed, offended my principles. They can arbitrarily alter
&gt; the contract but I cannot! The final straw came with the increased
&gt; charges,
&gt; topped of with the cessation of the 'hold account' (allowed me, I was
&gt; assured,
&gt; to keep my existing email address). It will now cost me close to
&gt; $100/month an
&gt; increase of ~$20 to maintain the service previously provided. Apparently
&gt; no
&gt; correspondence will be entered into. This contrasts with the fact that
&gt; everywhere
&gt; else in the world broadband prices are decreasing! The fact that Tel$tra
&gt; has
&gt; control of the local loop is disgusting, and I hail Internode's efforts
&gt; to
&gt; provide some sort of alternative service to Adelaide!
&gt; 
&gt; get off soapbox, run away/

&gt; &gt; I had similar issues with my burner/reader combination, I tried a number

&gt; &gt; The burner in question is a Sony 10x CDR SCSI and the reader is a Pioneer

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm using CD Bakeoven at the moment, that picks it up fine (and works),
&gt; &gt; whereas Xcdroast and Gnome-toaster don't recognize the reader.
&gt; 
&gt; Just as an other opinion,  x-cd-roast recognize both the burner and the

&gt; Subject: forwarding ports to another machine
&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to know how to do the following, is there any simple way of
&gt; doing it..
&gt; 
&gt; I have a machine that can only connect on a certian port to get email.. I
&gt; have a linux server which has pop3/smtp setup on that port... I have an ISP
&gt; whos mail server is not setup on that port. What I would like to know is how
&gt; I can use my linux server on that port to get mail from my isp via pop3.
&gt; 
&gt; ie. i want to connect to a ip/port on my linux machine which passes the
&gt; connection on to my isps mail server on the correct normal pop3 port, and
&gt; thus the mail comes back to me through my server. The server does not need
&gt; to store the mail, I just want it to pass the connection on, but on the
&gt; correct ports... is this possible??
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Michael

&gt; 
&gt; If you flip this issue around on itself, you'll see why I think that 
&gt; the -option- of firewalling the connection will be very popular for 
&gt; less educated and worldly-wise people than your good self.
&gt; 
&gt; The piece I missed initially was making it optional. We've fixed that 
&gt; in response to a number of very sensible pieces of feedback on the 
&gt; matter from this list.
&gt; 
&gt; For those who elect to use the filter when we provide it, we'll be 
&gt; using it to protect those less educated users than you from all sorts 
&gt; of things they don't want to know about and won't appreciate (being 
&gt; broken into; getting a huge unexpected bill).
&gt; 
&gt; Customers who use our filtering won't be charged for packets we block.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Perhaps a bit of clarification about the idle and 18 hour timeout would
&gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt;appreciated though. Why? If I'm on DHCP, not using bandwidth etc how is
&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt;a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Its really more about being up front with our rotation rate, unlike 
&gt; other ADSL providers who don't even disclose how long they'll hold an 
&gt; address up for.
&gt; 
&gt; Since you're obviously savvy on dynamic dns frobs etc, you will 
&gt; obviously just set up a script to reconnect/reconfigure things when 
&gt; needed, so you're not going to even notice the 18 hour rotation of IP 
&gt; address.
&gt; 
&gt; These things are partially there to protect less educated people than 
&gt; you, for whom its far safer to have their computer disconnect from 
&gt; the 'net if they go on holiday for a week and leave their computer 
&gt; on, than it is to leave it online indefinitely.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember we're trying to cater to a community far wider than just LinuxSA here.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I love the standby dialup!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So given the above, I'm in!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you!
