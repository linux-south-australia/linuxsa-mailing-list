&gt; A problem with breaking up one company into several is thus:
&gt; Multiple privatised companies all try to make a profit. The cumalative
&gt; profit margin at the end of the line has, in practice, often been higher
&gt; than before the company was split up.

But the increase in profit isn't necessarily at the expense of existing 
customers.  Often it's due to the size of the market increasing.  An example 
is that interstate bandwidth in Australia is very expensive as Telstra (as 
an example) do not see value in selling excess capacity on their fibre as 
they see it'll take away from their data carriage business.

If Telstra is broken up in the manner I discussed earlier, then that 
component of Telstra is going to be looking for revenue, and thus should 
allow more access to the interstate capacity at a lower cost, hence 
(through the magic of S&D) more people will participate in the market as the 
cost and availablity will improve. (eg. Internode may run their own SDH 
links to Vic/NSW/QLD to allow access to SXC etc).

This means that the profit of that component of Telstra may increase (as the 
extra capacity costs them nothing except Opportunity cost).  The other 
components of the broken up Telstra may experience a decrease in profits 
initially, but as their prices drop the number of people wanting to buy 
affordable interstate data carriage will increase and their profit will rise 
again.

This example is obviously a little simplistic but you, hopefully, see my 
point.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What does privatizing Telstra have to do with it?  Personally I think
&gt; &gt; &gt; that'd be one of the /worst/ outcomes:  At least they currently have
&gt; &gt; &gt; to put up the pretense of community service;  The only motive they'd
&gt; &gt; &gt; have if they were 100% privately owned would be profit.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; /Then/ you'd see their monopolistic tendencies come to the fore...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; However, at the moment you have a big problem and that is the Government has
&gt; &gt; two rolls: one as owner of Telstra second as regulator.  Because they have
&gt; &gt; conflicting rolls we end up that because they want to sell Telstra soon
&gt; &gt; they're happy to allow Telstra to run up big profits at the moment (jacking
&gt; &gt; up prices, reducing spending) to get the best price for it later.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At least if they sold it off they'd be happier to regulate it more closely.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not that ultimately I think that'd work either, I think they need to divide
&gt; &gt; Telstra into separate companies - eg. longhaul (interstate), local (eg. last
&gt; &gt; mile copper, local loop etc) and services (internet, switching, etc) - this
&gt; &gt; would allow companies to buy services more easily from Telstra where it has
&gt; &gt; a true monopoly (local loop) and compete more sucessfully in others (eg.
&gt; &gt; internet).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; However, we get back to the problem that the Govt is the owner and wants to
&gt; &gt; maximise sale price and so won't break it up because it'd reduce the sell
&gt; &gt; price.
