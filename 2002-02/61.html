I have come up with this script that will run from ip-up, and will have
a cron job run once-daily to delete the file /tmp/autoupgrade. Now my
problem is that I don't know whether this script will actually work and
how to test it... Could people please let me know if they think I should
be doing anything differently? (I am fairly new to shell scripting) Also
this script is fairly long (i think) is there a simpler way I should be
doing it?

#!/bin/sh

if [ ! -e /tmp/autoupgrade ]
then
        exit_status=1
        while [ $exit_status != 0 ]
# put in a while loop so that if the command gets an error (ie
downloading of files failed) then the command is fun again
        do
                pppstats
                ppp_status=$?
                if [ $? = 1 ]
                then
                        exit 0
                        fi
# check whether ppp0 is still up, as if it disconnected the script could
just keep running the command which just keep returning errors, nasty
loop (i think, would this actually happen?) the script just exits and
will be re-run next time ip-up is run.
                apt-get update
                exit_status=$?
                done
# same stuff below, just for the second part, apt-get upgrade
        exit_status=1
        while [ $exit_status != 0 ]
        do
                pppstats
                ppp_status=$?
                if [$? = 1 ]
                then
                        exit 0
                        fi
                apt-get -dy upgrade
                exit_status=$?
                done

        touch /tmp/autoupgrade
# make the file, so that if if-up is run again on the same day it wont
make it past the first check and the script will exit
        fi

&gt; Well I don't run debian, but I've seen the other replies and wonder...
&gt; 
&gt; I'd put the commands in a shell script and cron that. Maybe create a
&gt; file in ip-up and delete it again with ip-down, and then get the script
&gt; to use "test" to check if that file exists. If it doesn't then exit. You
&gt; could vary this method to write a file on completion so the script could
&gt; check for that to see if it has already completed the task for the day.
&gt; If not then run the upgrade. Just cron the script for example every 2
&gt; hours, and if the script has already successfully run the upgrade for
&gt; the day, then the script will detect the file created and exit.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want/need help with the script just let me know.

&gt; &gt; I have been looking into using cron (anacron more specifically) to have
&gt; &gt; apt-get upgrade my system once a day, I have managed it but I would like
&gt; &gt; to know a better way to do it. Currently my crontab looks like this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 0 21 * * * apt-get update
&gt; &gt; 0 * * * * apt-get -dy upgrade
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now the problem is if I am not connected to the internet at this time.
&gt; &gt; In this case I would like the commands run later on during the day when
&gt; &gt; it is connected. I could put something in ip-up but that would run twice
&gt; &gt; on the same day if I connected twice, which I don't want.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, sometimes while downloading the packages I get errors along the
&gt; &gt; lines of "remote end closed connection". In this case I would also like
&gt; &gt; the 'apt-get -dy upgrade' run to try and download the missing files.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have been thinking about this for a few days now but thought it might
&gt; &gt; be nice to see other people's way of achieving this the best. Thankyou
&gt; &gt; for any ideas you can provide.
