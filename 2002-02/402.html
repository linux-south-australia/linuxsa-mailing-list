Richard,
I've had this problem - I have an ISA PCMCIA adapter and some Cabletron 
RoamAbouts (previously I was using WebGear Aviator, but they don't suport 
W2k on my Laptop).

What you need to do is pick an IRQ that is available and then exclude all of 
the rest, also you may need to exclude various memory areas.

You do this (on RH7.1/7.2) in /etc/pcmcia/config.opts:

exclude irq 1
exclude irq 2
etc

include irq 9 
(for instance)

and  include only the one you want to.  This is the only way I have gotten 
it to work.  Also, it's worth getting pcmcia to only test the ioports and 
memory areas you want it to use as pcmcia seems to quite happily stomp on 
things (my older server had some dodgy IDE controller and stomping on that 
caused the machine to lock hard - req a power cycle).

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Over the last few days I have been struggling with a PCMCIA problem on a
&gt; Linux machine.
&gt; 
&gt; This problem exists for 2.4.17 and 2.2.20, so it seem not to be version
&gt; specific as I initially thought.
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to get a WebGear WLAN card working on a PCI-only PC CHIPS
&gt; mobo (an M810-LR) or something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a TI1410-based CardBus bridge card, and the i82365 driver loads
&gt; OK for that card, but complains that IRQ10 (or IRQ11, wherever it is)
&gt; can't be tested.
&gt; 
&gt; It also does not try to test any ISA interrupts.
&gt; 
&gt; Then when the WLAN driver (ray_cs) loads, it complains that it could not
&gt; get an IRQ (RequestIRQ: Resource temporarily busy) or something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; I have fiddled with settings in /etc/sysconfig/pcmcia (this is a
&gt; RedHat-based setup), but to no avail.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone suggest my next approach? Is this remediable?
&gt;
