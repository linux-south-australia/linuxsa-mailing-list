&gt;you talking telecoms? or in general?
&gt;I do it all the time.  I notice lots of places these days have a
&gt;clause saying something to the effect that you can change whatever
&gt;T&C you like but it has no effect unless agreed to in writing by
&gt;us.  I personally don't hold with that, the bit of paper(s) I sign
&gt;accepting a quote etc is _the_ contract between us.
&gt;

Unfortunately, telecommunications carriers are able to legally change 
the contract that you have with them for any service on their 
standard price list, and you are deemed to have read and agreed to 
the changes, and your recourse is only to stop taking the service.

I am referring to the 'Standard Form of Agreement' (SFOA) - 
<A HREF="http://www.telstra.com.au/sfoa,">http://www.telstra.com.au/sfoa,</A> a document which is -regularly- 
changed (and you're supposed to notice the little adverts in the 
Australian newspaper when it does).

This governs everything about Telstra Retail phone and data services 
(*not* ADSL, interestingly). The SFOA is a legal instrument available 
to all carriers under the telecommunications act, and an number of 
other carriers use them as well.

This is now Telstra have been able to legally strip ISP's from being 
able to use something called CDNO (way off topic) - its a RETAIL 
service under the SFOA, and Telstra Wholesale never developed 
(refused to provide) a wholesale version under a different contract, 
and so to remove it from ISP's, Telstra simply amended the Retail 
SFOA to say that ISP's couldn't have it.  No recourse.

It allows (and is designed to simplify) the process of signing up for 
a new phone line at home to involve a 'simple' form and a one liner 
saying that you agree to the terms of the SFOA (**including future 
changes**), rather than handing you what is (literally) a telephone 
book of terms and conditions, and one which changes regularly.

Changes to the SFOA are registered with the government, they aren't 
just random changes for random reasons, but once a change is 
registered, it's *in*.

<A HREF="http://www.aca.gov.au/consumer/sfoa/sfoa.htm">http://www.aca.gov.au/consumer/sfoa/sfoa.htm</A>

There are actually some really good reasons for this, and your notion 
of changing the contract is still fine, sales can be made outside of 
the SFOA, or in a manner which overrides appropriate SFOA conditions, 
by mutual agreement. I'd just like to see you manage to get Telstra 
Retail to agree to vary the terms of the SFOA for your next retail 
phone line before they install it.

Cheers,
Simon
