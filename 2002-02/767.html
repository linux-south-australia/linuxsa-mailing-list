Hello List,

I don't often have much to say and usually just lurl so here goes.

I agree that there is a long way to go before Linux is accepted as a 
genuine alternative OS to MS "Win XX -whatever" First of all, I have 
never considered myself as any kind of computer genius. I am employed in 
a totally unrelated industry that just happens to use PC's to perform 
basic functions that include Email and stock issue/control via MIMS.

My interest in computing is more of a hobby. I have been able to setup a 
home network that consists of an E-smith server, several PC's that 
connect to it through a HP Ethertwist hub. Most of the PC's run some 
form of Windows with the exception of my own. My main PC multiboots with 
Win98SE/XP/RH7.2. (RH being my default prefered OS) All of my family has 
access to email, internet and the resources attached or within all the 
PC's on the network.

It is my experience that the average punter has difficulty setting up 
their own email and internet connections let alone installing and 
configuring an operating system let alone fixing things that may go 
wrong along the way. I can not believe how many calls I get from friends 
and aquaintances asking for help with computer problems.

On one hand we have Windows which has a very easy installer and in most 
cases works straight out of the box. On the other hand there is Linux, 
and depending which flavour you have, requires a lot of preparation in 
the form of reading to ensure it works after install.

Once Windows is installed generally this is where the average punter 
will start to have problems, as most people do not want to dedicate too 
much time to learning how to manage and maintain there PC.

Linux on the other hand requires far more effort and reading to get it 
set up, and in most "newbie" cases they give up before reaching a stage 
where they can cast off their previous operating systems and reap the 
long term rewards of their stable operating system.

This is where the difference will be made. The long term survival and 
proliferation of the Linux environment will depend on either the system 
becoming extremely easy to install, setup and use or there is a much 
more proactive and upbeat help system for newbies from within the 
experienced community using Linux.

An observation, when I first posted to a Linux list I used Outlook 
Express (HTML) I received many emails that told me that HTML was not 
liked by the Linux community and not one of those emails offered me any 
assistance with my particular problem. This nearly blew me away. 
Fortunately I am not discouraged so easily.

I apologise for the lengthy post.

Anthony T.
