Hi all...

There were a few comments agreeing with my point off-list, though I'm
actually surprised that there weren't more than there was...

Anyway, it seems that people mind less than I expected. I think this is
because the sales-type material is often mixed with or comes from the
same sources as good technical material, and people do appreciate that
material (and, indeed the knowledge of what is going on in ISPland --
why some things cost $$$ here, why some things take ages, where we can
get ADSL or wireless and so on...)... I also appreciate that material,
and even like to know what's going on in ISPland... 

However, it would seem that balance is generally desired. People want
the input from ISP types on technical issues, and on non-technical
issues, and they want to know which ISP is offering what product, and
for how much. They also want to support ISPs that support the list. Fair
enough. Would it be OK to ask that ISP people[1] commenting on
ISP-related issues disclose that interest when making non-technical
comments? Perhaps it would be sensible to ask that of all people with
vested interest in things to disclose this clearly (eg "Cisco Routers
are the best (I work for Cisco)" -- or just have "Saleswomble, Cicso
Australia" in the .sig), and to request that business (Sales) type
material is clearly marked, and followup posts are take offline... I
would expect that of any business on LinuxSA, to be honest... 

Some hypothetical egs to think about:

* If employees of consulting companies (or independant consultants)
started advocating their services regularly, would that bother people?
If they did it from non-business addresses with no indication that they
work there?

* If computer store owners took every opportunity to sell their wares?
(eg Can anyone recommend a RAID card ... Yes, I sell this one for $blah)
... if they did it as if they were customers? (eg ... yes, &lt;my company&gt;
will sell them for $blah -- I think &lt;my company&gt; is very good)

* If all the ISP types on this list were to chip in with their own take
every time Internet access came up (we do &lt;this service&gt; for &lt;this much&gt;
and we are the best because of &lt;this&gt;) ...

In most instances, this would create a stir, with other who are in
competition either jumping in and saying "no, buy it from me, I'm the
best" or just sitting back and sulking... Neither of which is good...

Can I suggest that Commercial postings (ISP or not) get given the [COMM]
subject line marker, and people are a little more careful about
disguised advocacy (disclosing your employer in your .sig would help)
... 

Comments? Or do people think that I should just drop this -- I don't
want to force my opinion on people who don't agree or just don't think
it matters...

rr


[1] a loose definition meaning "those with some vested interest in a
specific ISP"... employees, shareholders, etc...
