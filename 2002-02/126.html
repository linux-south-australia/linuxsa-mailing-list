Does the Dlink one give you anymore stats on what's happening with regards 
to line errors etc?  Not that I guess one needs to know, but one might be an 
obsessive about these things ... :-)  (The STH doesn't tell you much which 
can be annoying since every now and again it requires a power cycle to talk 
to the remote end - maybe power related or Tel$tra).

Have you used the Netcomm NB1400?  Around $460 from some online outlets, but 
with a router in it - no idea about it aside from that (Netcomm seem 
reluctant to give out more info).

&gt; This is part of why xDSL is so much nicer the modems. xDSL simply 
&gt; doesn't have the 'your modem doesn't like my access server' issues. 
&gt; They work or they don't. Absolutely bloody wonderful, that.
&gt; 
&gt; The DSL-300 is the current popular choice in our customer base for 
&gt; the sensible reason that its cheaper, and works just as well, as the 
&gt; alcatel ST home.

&gt; &gt;look to have almost identical specs etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Anyone recommend a good DSL "modem" but also cheap (must be external
&gt; &gt;and present an ethernet interface not USB)?
