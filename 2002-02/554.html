yeah i've managed to get two to burn, both the SE 0.9.9 and the older one
cos SE doesn't like me...  we're not having much luck here at the moment
mostly due to using crap hardward....  i use nero and rename the .iso to
.nrg   i couldn't even get Roxio to burn the .iso at all...  very sad...
(windows based i might add)...  also do you know how to get the files out of
the .iso?  linux will mount it or use winimage (shareware) on windows to
read/extract (use google)...  you can then make a boot floppy and put the
files on a http/ftp server......

&gt;Anybody had a problem with the special edition smoothwall (SmoothWall
0.9.9
&gt;Special Edition GPL ISO) off the site?  i boot from CD and it get's to the

&gt;floppy for some reason and just sits there forever (i say forever because
i
&gt;left it overnight and i don't think i'll be waiting any longer)....

Can't say that I have had this problem, I am still trying to get my Plextor
Burner to make CD that I can read !

I have not got the correct options set in the burner software to burn the
image cleanly, my coaster pile continues to grow.  Grrr...  ~8(

Have you tried putting a blank floppy in the drive, some older machines
could not inform the BIOS of the absence of a floppy disk in the drive
(Win95 problem), not sure if SmoothWall is tolerant, might get you to the
next screen.
