&gt; when i installed rh72 i installed grub as my bootloader, and everything

&gt; refused to load stage 1.5/2, giving me the error "Grub: Hard Disk
&gt; Error". according to the grub manual, this means "The stage2 or stage1.5
&gt; is being read from a hard disk, and the attempt to determine the size
&gt; and geometry of the hard disk failed." there's no info on any way to
&gt; solve this problem in the manual. thus, my machine was unbootable.
&gt; 
&gt; i played around with bios options for the disk, auto detecting/manually
&gt; specifying the size/etc, but had no joy. i managed to rescue it
&gt; eventually, kinda, by booting off the redhat install cd with 'linux
&gt; rescue' and making a grub boot disk. i can boot both redhat and windows
&gt; off this boot disk - but this is far from ideal (me and floppies just
&gt; don't get along). i was going to try re-installing grub, but i'm not
&gt; really sure how to do this. either that or re-install rh72.
&gt; 
&gt; anyone got any other suggestions? does anyone out there know anything
&gt; about grub and can help? or does anyone know any grub mailing lists or
&gt; similar i could talk to?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,

Hi Ben,

Don't know if this is too late or not.....I'm a bit behind in my email.

Last week I decided to move grub to my mbr. A quick 'man grub' told me
to type
'info grub', and lo and behold....the full manual!  :-)

You need to edit the /boot/grub/grub.conf file.

Clues on how to do this are in the Naming Convention section: 

<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/manual/grub-0.90/html_chapter/grub_2.html">http://www.gnu.org/manual/grub-0.90/html_chapter/grub_2.html</A>#SEC6

..this will tell what partitions are called what. 

The 'Installing GRUB natively' section:
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/manual/grub-0.90/html_chapter/grub_3.html">http://www.gnu.org/manual/grub-0.90/html_chapter/grub_3.html</A>#SEC9

..will tell you how to set the root partition and use the setup command
to write
to the mbr from the grub shell.

It surprised me how easy it was!

HIH,

Craig
