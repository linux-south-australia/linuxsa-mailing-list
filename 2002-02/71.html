One of the problems for me (if I could get dsl.. in the hills, yeah
right) is the cap would be reached far too quickly. When we were on
bigpond dialup we reached the 300mb cap in like a week (if we made it
last the month, it would be avg 10mb a day which we use so quickly). Now
with the much faster download rate, even a cap of 500mb would go so
quick you wouldn't know what has happened.

Granted, different people use the net differently. I think if the price
was reduced more customers who aren't heavy net users would sign up,
justifying a bigger cap for the few that do need/want it. Then again,
this might just attract people to scab up all they can and lose you
money. It's a hard one.

&gt; Simon,
&gt; 
&gt; I have looked at your proposed ADSL pricing for home use, and it looks quite
&gt; attractive. I would like to say that I can appreciate the tightrope you are
&gt; probably walking between pricing and cost of service/support issues, and that
&gt; your inital offering is a great start, and will be an excellent replacement
&gt; for people on existing dial up services.
&gt; 
&gt; You said in one of your emails to linuxsa:
&gt; 
&gt; [1] What I mean here is that some of you have said 'Its wonderful
&gt; except for &lt;x&gt;'. Well, I challenge you to -buy- it from us if we
&gt; address &lt;x&gt; to your satisfaction, without then saying 'Oh, thanks,
&gt; but how about &lt;y&gt;, and -then- I'd like it', and repeating that
&gt; iterative loop until one of us goes barking bad.  Support us, and
&gt; we'll keep listening to your needs.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I will accept that challenge. I am an existing, and relatively
&gt; longstanding, Internode ISDN dial-on-demand customer that *will* be ordering
&gt; _one_ of the ADSL products within the next couple of weeks. Which one is
&gt; still problematic for me. Here is why:
&gt; 
&gt; 1 .. $90 p/m is probably all I want spend on Internet access. It works out to
&gt; around $1000 p/a, in excess of which getting hard to justify.
&gt; 
&gt; 2 .. I want to be able to run an SMTP server, Web server, ssh server etc on
&gt; my machine. This is a lot easier if I have a static IP address.
&gt; 
&gt; 3 .. I want a traffic cap more in the order of 1 - 1.5 GB p/m that 500MB.
&gt; 
&gt; On the surface, it sounds like I want the business service, but with a higher
&gt; cap, or a lower price ! Just like any services - you can have high speed,
&gt; good quality and low price - pick any two !
&gt; 
&gt; So that is probably what I will go with - the business service. But if you
&gt; want to make me a really happy customer, you could think about one of these:
&gt; 
&gt; 1 .. Increase the cap on the $89 business service plan, even 500MB -&gt; 750MB
&gt; would probably be enough to sway me.
&gt; 
&gt; 2 .. Let me pay extra (say $10-20p/m) for an unfiltered, static IP based
&gt; personal service. Most users will not take up this option, but it gives those
&gt; that want it the ability to choose, and rewards you with a little extra money
&gt; per month for the hassle.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this feedback helps ..
