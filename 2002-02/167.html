&gt;We should all make moves to get away from Hell$tra and ditch hard wired
&gt;land phones ('cos the beast owns the infrastructure and profits no
&gt;matter who your provider is).

While I'm no fan of Telstra, it can sometimes be a case of
better-the-devil-you-know if you depend on your phone line.

If another Telco makes a f*#$up of your service and has it disconnected, it
takes 7 days or so for the disconnect order to go through Telstra and become
actioned. So even if you find about this disconnection before it happens,
you have to wait until it does happen to have anything done about it. Then
you have to wait up to another 7 days to have it reconnected.

When you eventually get the line disconnected altogether, there's an even
chance that debt collectors will chase you for rental on a non-existent line
long after you've moved house. Debt collectors have no authority to cancel a
debt .. only the person you have to wait on hold for 40 minutes does. And
they only work 9 - 4:30, EST. And the telco will charge you for a mobile
call to their own service lines, when you're using their network, when your
landline doesn't work due to their incompetence

Telstra are used to bad billing, and have armies of people to deal with
irate customers [1]. One large Telstra competitor admitted to having just
*1* person rostered on weekday mornings to deal with residential billing
problems.

Use a competitor if it makes you feel better, but don't delude yourself that
you're getting rid of Telstra entirely. Chances are that they're still
pulling the strings, and you can't complain to them directly when something
goes wrong..

[1] Telstra staff training teaches them to mentally substitute the word
'pumpkin' for less pleasant words heard in a customer interaction.
