If the Star Office package is functional and reasonably priced, as a
small business I would not think twice about paying for it. I agree with
the opinions of others on this list that it has to be reasonable. Not in
the realm of M$.

To my way of thinking Linux will soon develop in two distinct
directions. Commercial software and from observation there is an
increasing amount being produced and the traditional OSS. Both can
happily live together. 

Without programmers I cannot use my computer. And unless I'm mistaken
programmers have to eat.  

Free doesn't always mean no cash cost.

Mind you like others I won't pay for rubbish.

I have no abilities to program a computer but I can use one reasonably
well and I have adopted Linux as my OS of {90%} choice. For personal use
and the internet Linux is brilliant however I also run a small business.
For me I only need ONE piece of software to complete the "defection" an
accounts package with all the ease of use of either Quickbooks or MYOB
and it must handle Australia's "simple" tax system and every three
months calculate the BAS. That single software solution would allow me
and many other small businesses the option to more completely to Linux
... forever.

GNUCash etc cannot handle the functions listed above. Some but not the
BAS.

I have downloaded and set up a dummy company in the new Quasar but
although it is very close .... not quite.

If anyone has a solution to the accounting problem could you contact me
off list.
