RE: Linux on Compaq laptops? (was: Linux on Highlander
laptops?)Hi Desiree (and others),
    Basically these are filter titles brought about through
some users of this list expressing their desire to filter
out the noise that occurs on this list sometimes. The basic
ones are:

[OT]                        Off Topic
[ANNOUNCE]       Anouncement
[NEWBIE]               For the I'm new and don't have a clue
questions

[EMPLOYMENT]    I want a Job or have a Job for someone
[COMM]                  A Commercial (this one is relatively
new)

    The idea is that if you don't want to receive messages
on these topics then you just filter them out. From time to
time people come up with new ones and as they come into
common usage and people adjust their filters. The most
important one is probably [OT], after all this is a list all
about LINUX, so some people don't take kindly to OFF TOPIC
messages. There are no real rules written in stone about
these things, but if you read a few of them then you will
get the hang of them fairly quickly.

    One last thing, when you post to this list, could you
please turn your Rich Text or HTML mail OFF, and post in
plain text. One thing that really works people into a frenzy
sometimes is HTML mail as it isn't easy to read on a text
only reader or terminal, and it wastes large amounts
bandwidth in transit and finally it is very difficult to
filter out. If you remember that then you shouldn't have too
many problems on the list. Hope this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.


&gt;What are the codes you should use in the Subject headings,
&gt;eg, I've seen '[OT]', '[COMM]', etc.
&gt;Are there others we should use?
