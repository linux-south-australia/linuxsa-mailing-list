[re: optional security screen service in ADSL]

&gt;I think this is a good idea... BTW is the option done on signup?
&gt;Configurable? Cost to switch?

It'll be user configurable via either a frob when you log in, or a 
web page. We haven't done the work to make it happen yet, so its  up 
in the air right now.

Thats why it won't turn up until March 2002.

Cost to switch and/or cost to have it active (if any) are decisions 
that haven't been made yet. But the definite data point is that 
cost-to-not-have-it will be zero :)
&gt;
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'm still not clear on this. Does it mean the connection DROPs every 18
&gt;hours or that the connection WILL last 18 hours minimum?
&gt;
&gt;If it's the first (ie drops) why the choice of 18 hours? What happens if
&gt;your doing something at the time that the connection drops?
&gt;(Sometimes i've been on a modem connection, it's dropped, I've dialed up
&gt;again got the same IP address and continued along like it never
&gt;disconnected...)
&gt;
&gt;Whats the ISP rational behind a 18 hour connection limit? Unlike modems
&gt;there is no "Dialing up" and having to free up lines for other
&gt;customers? (I can understand the 6 hour idle rule...)

Technically it means the PPP session communicated via the PPPoE 
protocol will have an 18 hour session time limit configured into it.

Your connect may not last that long if you log your PPPoE session off 
earlier (for whatever reason), or if Telstra botch something major 
enough (for whatever reason).

If your session does run 18 hours continuous then as currently 
configured that session will then drop, and your trivial-to-write 
to-dialler script will then reconnect immediately.

Whether you get the same IP or a different one is a lottery. But 
planning for a different one would avoid surprise.

&gt;
&gt;Another questions, I currently have ADSL with Telsta (contract to run
&gt;out in 2 months). I have a 4 port Alcatel Speed Touch Pro modem, it's
&gt;configured (without help from Telstra) to use it's PPTP to PPPoA (ie I
&gt;use the linux PPTP client instead of PPPoE). Would this configuration be
&gt;compatible with Internode? I have found that PPTP is easier to setup and
&gt;seems to have less CPU overhead. (I have no benchmarks to prove this
&gt;though...)
&gt;

You can break your contract with Telstra before Feb 14th if you want 
to, but you might indeed find that it works out better economically 
to run the two extra months and take the modem 'free' rather than pay 
whatever the modem payout figure is at this point in your contract. 
Your call.

If I understand the question, I think the answer is yes. i.e. if your 
device winds up initiating a PPPoA connection at the end of that 
configuration structure you've described, yes that's equivalent to 
PPPoE and works just as well (actually PPPoA works better - it 
doesn't have any issues with MTU size, in the way that PPPoE does 
with some operating systems).

&gt;
&gt;BTW I didn't expect your prices to come out so fast. Good work.

You should see how much less hair I have left now.
