Hi.

IMO, yes HylaFAX is the most robust fax server on linux, and probably more
robust than the commercial offerings on NT.

No idea what problems you expect with MIMEDefang, so I cannot comment.

HylaFAX modems can be configured to be send only, send and receive, allow
data calls in and out as well as send and receive, or any combination of
the above.

Earlier versions of HylaFAX had some local security exploits. I have not
heard of any security exploits with the current version.

Head over to www.hylafax.org and have a look at the faq. HylaFAX takes a
bit of an effort to get your mind around what is going on, but it rewards
the effort in spades! Our setup consists of a network of 5 HylaFAX servers
around the country connected to a big name ERP package that spits out
nearly a thousand faxes a day. There are cost savings in being able to use
existing linux boxes and no license fees, and we have also picked up lower
comms costs by routing faxes to the closest fax server thereby eliminating
inter-capital std fax calls. The prices offered by the NT fax server
brigade on this sort of setup is scary!

Regards,

Michael

&gt; Can you "lock down" a modem so that it can only communicate with other
&gt; Faxes - security issues ?
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am after a quick answer as to availability and reliability
&gt; &gt; of linux based
&gt; &gt; email to Fax gateway. I would normally scour the net but was
&gt; &gt; hoping for a
&gt; &gt; quick answer and some direction on where to look as one of
&gt; &gt; our interstate
&gt; &gt; offices is just about to request capital for Zetafax running
&gt; &gt; on a WinNT
&gt; &gt; server and I was hoping there might be an add-on or similar
&gt; &gt; that can be
&gt; &gt; linked to sendmail to provide a faxing out service.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; All client PCs are Win based, email server and Internet
&gt; &gt; gateway is Redhat
&gt; &gt; 7.1 running sendmail.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards
