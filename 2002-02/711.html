&gt;I gather I need to set up dhcp.conf. My lan card on linux box set with IP
all ok. PPP internet all ok. 
&gt;I can get the win2k to gather info from dhcp, but setting up dhcp.conf have
no idea. Also, I assume I 
&gt;need to specify somewhere some routing info to direct outward info from the
gateway (linux box) through 
&gt;the modem. I don't know how to do this either.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;The configuration would look something like this: 
&gt;MELBOURNE:
ADELAIDE: 
&gt;win? &lt;--&gt; DHCP linux server--&gt;  MODEM &lt;--&gt; MODEM                &lt;--linux
server  DHCP &lt;--&gt;win2k 
&gt;Anyone care to plunge in? 

You'll find that DHCP has little or nothing to do with what you're trying to
achieve here, I'm wondering if you understand the complications of what
you're
trying to achieve, its certainly possible, but whether the end result would
be
worth it or not is up to you, a couple of options:

1. You could either try a direct IP connection between your linux server and
his,
ie: set one up as a RAS server using mgetty or something similar, STD costs
for this
type of set up would kind of negate the enjoyment of the golf methinks

2. You could try a VPN connection between the two linux boxes over the
internet,
a bit more complicated to set up, but would achieve what you want which is
both
Windoze boxes appearing on the same "local" network

Either way, DHCP is only used locally from the server to the workstation and
has
little to do with either side being able to see each other or not.
I'd probably recommend an out-of-the-box setup such as Smoothwall which
supports 
this type of connection.  It would save you a lot of headaches (by the sound
of it
you may have one already ;)
