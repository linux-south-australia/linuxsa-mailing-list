&gt; &gt; The HTML email thread has been done to death. The 
&gt; conclusion is always
&gt; 
&gt; HTML e-mail is evil.

Well, that too...

&gt; &gt; hard not to degenerate (hell, I've done it often enough), but if we 
&gt; &gt; all default to tolerance (of newbies, pour speling grammar, OT 
&gt; &gt; messages, and of people who get defensive or offensive), then the 
&gt; &gt; attitude will build
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with everything you say Richard, but I think you 
&gt; should add "acceptance that some list members will not agree 
&gt; with every statement that has been made and argue strongly to 
&gt; support a different or even contrary argument". What they are 
&gt; actually saying is that I am displaying "attitude" -- for 
&gt; some definition of attitude -- because of what I am saying. I 
&gt; think they are trying to say "we don't like the way he's saying it".

Well, I can't quite work out what you are meaning here, but ...
whatever... I probably agree. :)

&gt; I consider the arguments used to say that "Windows" is better 
&gt; than "Linux" shaky at the best and I have pointed out why. 
&gt; Noticably, I've not actually enunciated any binary (i.e. yes 
&gt; or no) position on this matter. All I've done is say I think 
&gt; your arguments are bad, try again.

Not that I know what that has to do with anything... :)

&gt; :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing has changed at all around here.

evidently :)
