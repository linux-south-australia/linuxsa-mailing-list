Hi,
PTSN specs may be of use to people looking to connect modems up which
share the line with other devices, so I feel whilst this request is
Off-Topic, it is of interest to all computer users.

OVERVIEW:
I have found a fax-switch, designed for the US market.
It works almost perfectly, except it doesn't detect properly that my
Telstra handset is still on-hook. (Maybe thats the problem:- Telstra)

The FaxSwith has a PIC controller a few other common ICs & discrete
components.
It will not be to hard to reverse engineer to modify its line detection
parameters :)

SYMPTOMS:
When an incoming call is switched to the phone outlet, it only rings
the outlet once, as I'm assuming it has "detected" that the phone is
off-hook, so it stops ringing & connects the incoming line.

Figuring the all-electronic handset is not a heavy load, I plugged 2
Telstra handsets in, but with the same result.

It is not a setup problem as if I plug my fax-modem into the phone
outlet, the outlet rings twice & is then answered by the modem, which
is set to answer after 2 rings.
Whilst the modem is AUSTEL-approved, it probably works as it is based
on a US model.

HYPOTHESIS:
So I suspect that the line voltages/loading specifations for an US PSTN
line are slightly different to those for an Australian PSTN line & the
FaxSwitch isn't quite realising the state of play. It looks like it is
only out a little as my fax-modem can talk to it properly.

QUESTIONS:
Where could I find the PSTN specs for Australia & US?
Alternatively, perhaps others have have had similar experiences & can
offer some advice.

Regards,

Daryl  Pilkington
