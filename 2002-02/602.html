&gt;I was wondering if some one could point me in the right direction.
&gt;I have this private project of my own that has been on the back burners
&gt;for the last 8 years, The problems I have had up to date is what
&gt;language to use / learn.
&gt;
&gt;The project consits of a GPS to obtain locational data and a series of
&gt;maps that are obtainable 9 cd's for south australia basically needs to
&gt;'move the map' image which are tiffs using rs232 data in a standard nema
&gt;format.
&gt;
&gt;There are other things I wouls like to do but this is the bare bones,
&gt;yes and change maps automatically.
&gt;
&gt;This sounds like a lot of work but I have no idea what would be the best
&gt;langauge to use, yes I would like to program under linux, pooie to
&gt;windzose I allready have a program that I have bought and works very
&gt;well but it requires a fast machine.
&gt;
&gt;I have already invested over $1000 in maps only for S.A. and I would
&gt;like to see them used on a daily bases on a brick pc that I have with a
&gt;lcd 10.4".

Paul,

Stick with the linux options, especially those that *may* be M$ portable.
There is a program for Linux called Xastir which is an amateur radio
tracking program which would have the basics of what you are after.   The
graphical front end to it was written in LessTif (Motif derivative) which
quite frankly sucks.   It is incredibly slow, even on a celleron 600MHz
machine.

Pick a programming language that has fast graphic capabilities, keep away
from heavily interpreted languages you just wont get the graphical response
you are after.   I have some good references for C++ libs for decoding NMEA
0183 sentences, GUI stuff unfortuately is not my field.

As an aside I have been using the program that you mention aswell for the
National RDF (Radio Direction Finding) championships held in Mt Gambier,
for the last three years.   Would definitely like to see an alternative as
I would like to add some features which would help me with my RDF tracking,
ie Automatic bearing updates from my Doppler, manual input bearings etc...

Cheers

Matthew
