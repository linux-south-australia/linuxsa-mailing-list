&gt; &gt; It's becoming apparent that there are different preferences out there
&gt; &gt; for either BSD or Linux and I am becoming concerned that there might
&gt; &gt; erupt another UNIX brawl bertween these two platforms,
&gt; 
&gt; Choice does eventually bring about a better result, however a monopoly
&gt; also has its advantages. Under a proper competition model, competition
&gt; (i.e. choice) should bring about a number of better products. However,
&gt; it can also degenerate into unhealthy competition where one has
&gt; competition not to provide choice but to dominate. Conversely, a
&gt; monopoly doesn't ever suffer unhealthy competition but it can produce a
&gt; less desirable or technically good product.
&gt; 
&gt; Note the word "can" -- if I recall my Unix [tm] history correctly in the
&gt; olden days you could buy the rights to modify or alter the proprietary
&gt; sources for your own purposes. Unlike other companies' licences this
&gt; would at least allow your company to implement whatever changes you
&gt; wanted in the code.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; its a bit like having the UNIX camp being on the group of people who
&gt; &gt; like to play football and the windows group people who like to play
&gt; &gt; soccer, and the BSD team and the Linux team on the same competition
&gt; &gt; freindly but competitive.
&gt; 
&gt; But spectators do like to watch soccer teams brawl and have it out on
&gt; the field. Using your analogy, I'd prefer to watch the soccer rather
&gt; than a football league with a single football team. Now, that would make
&gt; football even more boring than it already is...
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;dons asbestos suit&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; at the present we are trying to get the soccer crowd to come and play
&gt; &gt; football with us but if for instance we are continuing to have a Port -
&gt; &gt; Norwood type of conflict in the camp the soccer crowd are going to think
&gt; &gt; that were nuts and we arent serious about what we are doing.
&gt; 
&gt; Your analogy falls over here. If they hear us saying "FreeBSD
&gt; implemented a more sane TCP/IP stack" with a Linux reply "Yes, we know,
&gt; we literally implemented it verbatim in Linux but you implemented our
&gt; System V IPC" [these are not real examples] then is that really bad? If
&gt; the *BSD mob are shouting at the Linux mob because they're
&gt; implementation of [insert something to do with the Linux kernel] isn't
&gt; up to scratch then that's a good thing. People can make choices rather
&gt; than listen to the marketing drones.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; this one fact remains, we all need to band togeather to see the common
&gt; &gt; acceptance of the UNIX platform and we all rely on the work of the Free
&gt; &gt; Software Foundation (and I accept that both Linux and BSD would still be
&gt; &gt; arround in some form or another without it but our lives are richer for
&gt; &gt; its existence), so lets get on and work with our prefered platforms and
&gt; &gt; respect what the other is doing as one or the other is not the real
&gt; &gt; competion
&gt; 
&gt; I don't mind the Free Software Foundation but every now and then Richard
&gt; Stallman does say some peculiar things; he's generally misquoted -- for
&gt; some reason the Chinese Whisper Syndrome [1] seems to be really bad when
&gt; people report what he says. Furthermore, I think the *BSD crowd don't
&gt; like the GPL and FSF/Stallman don't like the BSD licence. We don't rely
&gt; on the work of the FSF; we rely on licences such as the *BSD style
&gt; licences or the [L]GPL, the MIT/X licence and so forth. We rely on good
&gt; faith and good will.

does this mean that you wont be using GPL software on you BSD computer?


&gt; 
&gt; The one thing we must all understand is that there are no single
&gt; communities. There never has been and never will be. I picture Unix as a
&gt; set of streams. All the streams flow towards the same sea, sometimes
&gt; they intermingle, sometimes they attempt to or actually erode each
&gt; others shores.
&gt; 
&gt; So what does this mean?
&gt; 
&gt; If I want to get from point A to point B by boat I can choose whichever
&gt; stream I want. If I want a picturesque stream, I choose it. If I want a
&gt; really fast but deadly dull and boring stream, I choose that one. If I
&gt; want to be able to choose downstream what stream I want to be on, I make
&gt; sure I start on a stream which crosses over other streams...

&gt; [1] Get a group of about 15 people and read a paragraph from any
&gt; book...you have exactly 10 seconds to read it and you must stop talking
&gt; as soon as 10 seconds is up. The person you whisper it to continues the
&gt; process and the final person says what it's about. I've seen a quote
&gt; about Mickey Mouse end up being a plausible quote about Little Red
&gt; Riding Hood with about 20 people! Now that was funny...but how did they
&gt; get from MM to LRR?
