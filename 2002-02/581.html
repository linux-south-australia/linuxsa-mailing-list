&gt; It's becoming apparent that there are different preferences out there
&gt; for either BSD or Linux and I am becoming concerned that there might
&gt; erupt another UNIX brawl bertween these two platforms,

Choice does eventually bring about a better result, however a monopoly
also has its advantages. Under a proper competition model, competition
(i.e. choice) should bring about a number of better products. However,
it can also degenerate into unhealthy competition where one has
competition not to provide choice but to dominate. Conversely, a
monopoly doesn't ever suffer unhealthy competition but it can produce a
less desirable or technically good product.

Note the word "can" -- if I recall my Unix [tm] history correctly in the
olden days you could buy the rights to modify or alter the proprietary
sources for your own purposes. Unlike other companies' licences this
would at least allow your company to implement whatever changes you
wanted in the code.

&gt; its a bit like having the UNIX camp being on the group of people who
&gt; like to play football and the windows group people who like to play
&gt; soccer, and the BSD team and the Linux team on the same competition
&gt; freindly but competitive.

But spectators do like to watch soccer teams brawl and have it out on
the field. Using your analogy, I'd prefer to watch the soccer rather
than a football league with a single football team. Now, that would make
football even more boring than it already is...

&lt;dons asbestos suit&gt;

&gt; at the present we are trying to get the soccer crowd to come and play
&gt; football with us but if for instance we are continuing to have a Port -
&gt; Norwood type of conflict in the camp the soccer crowd are going to think
&gt; that were nuts and we arent serious about what we are doing.

Your analogy falls over here. If they hear us saying "FreeBSD
implemented a more sane TCP/IP stack" with a Linux reply "Yes, we know,
we literally implemented it verbatim in Linux but you implemented our
System V IPC" [these are not real examples] then is that really bad? If
the *BSD mob are shouting at the Linux mob because they're
implementation of [insert something to do with the Linux kernel] isn't
up to scratch then that's a good thing. People can make choices rather
than listen to the marketing drones.

&gt; this one fact remains, we all need to band togeather to see the common
&gt; acceptance of the UNIX platform and we all rely on the work of the Free
&gt; Software Foundation (and I accept that both Linux and BSD would still be
&gt; arround in some form or another without it but our lives are richer for
&gt; its existence), so lets get on and work with our prefered platforms and
&gt; respect what the other is doing as one or the other is not the real
&gt; competion

I don't mind the Free Software Foundation but every now and then Richard
Stallman does say some peculiar things; he's generally misquoted -- for
some reason the Chinese Whisper Syndrome [1] seems to be really bad when
people report what he says. Furthermore, I think the *BSD crowd don't
like the GPL and FSF/Stallman don't like the BSD licence. We don't rely
on the work of the FSF; we rely on licences such as the *BSD style
licences or the [L]GPL, the MIT/X licence and so forth. We rely on good
faith and good will.

The one thing we must all understand is that there are no single
communities. There never has been and never will be. I picture Unix as a
set of streams. All the streams flow towards the same sea, sometimes
they intermingle, sometimes they attempt to or actually erode each
others shores.

So what does this mean?

If I want to get from point A to point B by boat I can choose whichever
stream I want. If I want a picturesque stream, I choose it. If I want a
really fast but deadly dull and boring stream, I choose that one. If I
want to be able to choose downstream what stream I want to be on, I make
sure I start on a stream which crosses over other streams...

[1] Get a group of about 15 people and read a paragraph from any
book...you have exactly 10 seconds to read it and you must stop talking
as soon as 10 seconds is up. The person you whisper it to continues the
process and the final person says what it's about. I've seen a quote
about Mickey Mouse end up being a plausible quote about Little Red
Riding Hood with about 20 people! Now that was funny...but how did they
get from MM to LRR?
