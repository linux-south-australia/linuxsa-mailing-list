howdy all,

i've had some issues with grub. first some background:

my computer had 3 drives in it - 1x20G, 1x6G & 1x30G. the 20G is
partitioned into 3, one NTFS with win2k installed, two fat32. the 6G is
a redhat 7.2 install. the 30G is another fat32, single partition.

when i installed rh72 i installed grub as my bootloader, and everything
was excellent, until i removed the 30G drive - at which point grub
refused to load stage 1.5/2, giving me the error "Grub: Hard Disk
Error". according to the grub manual, this means "The stage2 or stage1.5
is being read from a hard disk, and the attempt to determine the size
and geometry of the hard disk failed." there's no info on any way to
solve this problem in the manual. thus, my machine was unbootable.

i played around with bios options for the disk, auto detecting/manually
specifying the size/etc, but had no joy. i managed to rescue it
eventually, kinda, by booting off the redhat install cd with 'linux
rescue' and making a grub boot disk. i can boot both redhat and windows
off this boot disk - but this is far from ideal (me and floppies just
don't get along). i was going to try re-installing grub, but i'm not
really sure how to do this. either that or re-install rh72.

anyone got any other suggestions? does anyone out there know anything
about grub and can help? or does anyone know any grub mailing lists or
similar i could talk to?

thanks,

 - Ben
