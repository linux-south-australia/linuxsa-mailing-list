Hi Bruce and all,

the following just turned up in the Linux Forum on the CompuServe 
Network and I just had to share it, it relates closely to how some 
folks ask questions and how some folks answer them.

Hope everybody sees the funny side of this, it sure made my day a 
little better &lt;G&gt;


The solution for most Linux configuration problems is as follows.

1. Receive the usual advice to read the documentation.
2. Discover you can't find the documentation.
3. Look for documentation about where the documentation is.
4. Ask Jim or Carl where the documentation is.
5. Finally find the documentation and try to read it.
6. Skip over the disclaimer, the list of conributors to the 
documentation, the history of the documentation and all of the other 
irrelevant stuff that, by some Linux-GNU tradition, is always put at 
the beginning of the documentation instead of being appended to the end 
of it.
7. Read the documentation and find it uses terms that are not explained 
in the documentation.
8. Seek documentation for the undefined terms (goto Step 1).

Repeat this until Carl or Jim takes pity on you and says "Oh, that's 
simple, you just put this line in the &lt;yah-de-da&gt; file."

Go back to them later and ask them which lines and which file. When 
they finally admit they don't know and were only repeating what 
somebody else told them then go back to Step 1.
