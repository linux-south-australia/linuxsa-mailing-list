I think this is a good idea... BTW is the option done on signup?
Configurable? Cost to switch?

&gt; 
&gt; Customers who use our filtering won't be charged for packets we block.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Perhaps a bit of clarification about the idle and 18 hour timeout would
&gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt;appreciated though. Why? If I'm on DHCP, not using bandwidth etc how is
&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt;a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Its really more about being up front with our rotation rate, unlike 
&gt; other ADSL providers who don't even disclose how long they'll hold an 
&gt; address up for.
&gt; 
&gt; Since you're obviously savvy on dynamic dns frobs etc, you will 
&gt; obviously just set up a script to reconnect/reconfigure things when 
&gt; needed, so you're not going to even notice the 18 hour rotation of IP 
&gt; address.
&gt; 

I'm still not clear on this. Does it mean the connection DROPs every 18
hours or that the connection WILL last 18 hours minimum? 

If it's the first (ie drops) why the choice of 18 hours? What happens if
your doing something at the time that the connection drops? 
(Sometimes i've been on a modem connection, it's dropped, I've dialed up
again got the same IP address and continued along like it never
disconnected...)

Whats the ISP rational behind a 18 hour connection limit? Unlike modems
there is no "Dialing up" and having to free up lines for other
customers? (I can understand the 6 hour idle rule...)

&gt; These things are partially there to protect less educated people than 
&gt; you, for whom its far safer to have their computer disconnect from 
&gt; the 'net if they go on holiday for a week and leave their computer 
&gt; on, than it is to leave it online indefinitely.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember we're trying to cater to a community far wider than just LinuxSA here.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I love the standby dialup!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So given the above, I'm in!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 

Another questions, I currently have ADSL with Telsta (contract to run
out in 2 months). I have a 4 port Alcatel Speed Touch Pro modem, it's
configured (without help from Telstra) to use it's PPTP to PPPoA (ie I
use the linux PPTP client instead of PPPoE). Would this configuration be
compatible with Internode? I have found that PPTP is easier to setup and
seems to have less CPU overhead. (I have no benchmarks to prove this
though...)

&gt; Thank you!
&gt;

No thank you... I think i'll be joing Internode at the end of my Helstra
contract.

Tim

BTW I didn't expect your prices to come out so fast. Good work.
