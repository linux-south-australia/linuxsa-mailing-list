There are a couple of reasonable drawing packages around for Linux.

If your looking for 3D capability then VariCAD isn't too bad
<A HREF="http://praha2.varicad.com/en/main.php?SID">http://praha2.varicad.com/en/main.php?SID</A>=

or LinuxCAD
www.linuxcad.com

or for a GPL 2D package that has good possibilities 
check our FREEdraft2D
<A HREF="http://freeengineer.org/FREEdraft.html">http://freeengineer.org/FREEdraft.html</A>

Of course it all depends on what you want as an end result,
Linux seems to be lacking in mechanical CAD packages, especially
at the higher end and despite decent support by the major hardware vendors,
I'm doing my best to get Unigraphics (now totally owned
by EDS unfortunately) to port to Linux, not much success so far, but
some interest internally from engineers, just not from upper management.

A bit off topic, but just out of interest I've found an interesting article
on migrating to Linux in a machine shop scenario, for those that
are working in this environment is makes a good read.

&gt; Subject:	[Linux] Linux Drawing Programs - Visio replacements
&gt; 
&gt; Are there any drawing programs similar to Visio that people recommend for
&gt; use under Linux? I have looked at Qcad, Dia, Kontour, Sketch and a few
&gt; others. Fo me, Dia seems to be the better solution for what I want to do.
&gt; I was wondering if there are any other recent, good drawing programs out
&gt; there (besides Xfig).
&gt; 
&gt; I have played with Dia a bit, but I want to know if anyone has used it for
&gt; long enough to know its good and bad points.
