The HTML email thread has been done to death. The conclusion is always
that HTML is not real welcome, the list owners will not implement
filtering (despite offers to do the work from many a person), and when
people post HTML, others will ask that they post text, preferably
off-list and politely.

As for other comments here about negative attitude, au contraire, I have
recently been appreciating the postive attitude of this list.
Seriously... the root of this thread, which started a Long Long Time Ago
("IT Religions -- the ugly side...") was a comment by me on how
offensive people on OtherOS lists can be to someone who puts forth an
alternative point of view. That same attitude has persisted on the list
in question, and it comes across as mindlessly stupid and pointlessly
rude. Here, we do have some of that, but no-where near as much. It's
hard not to degenerate (hell, I've done it often enough), but if we all
default to tolerance (of newbies, pour speling grammar, OT messages, and
of people who get defensive or offensive), then the attitude will build
on itself, and the list will continue to get better -- an accepting,
welcoming Linux community will do wonders for itself. (as a counter eg,
I am very reluctant to do any work with OtherOS now, as the community
that I came accross was so hostile -- it's just not inviting... this is
despite it being quite a GoodOS for some purposes)...
