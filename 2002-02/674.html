&gt;Hmmm.... In the real world it seems that potential employers are looking
&gt;for credible qualifications and an acceptance of low pay and submissive
&gt;attitude to the established hierarchy. True, presentation plays an all
&gt;important role in the final decision to employ or reject, but I suspect
&gt;that making the right noises to stroke the right ego's plays a much more
&gt;important part in the equation.
&gt;

In today's business and legal environment, employers have to spend real 
money getting people and keeping people (even in an environment where 
there has been a slow down).

While pay is always a negotiable item, and a junior person is not 
expected to be just plain contrary, I would be surprised if any employer 
these days consciously took the attitude you claimed. It just leaves 
them too open to litigation and getting inferior employees.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For example my own experience.
&gt;
&gt;I have been running linux at home for nearly 7 years. Last year I sat
&gt;for, and passed without effort, two of the four SAIR Linux & GNU
&gt;Certification Level 1 System Administration exams. (now defunct)
&gt;
&gt;I spend most of my spare time hiding out on EFNET's #linuxhelp(where I'm
&gt;a channel op) helping newbie home users, and paid system administrators
&gt;fix their problems before their boss fires them or their machines become
&gt;unworkable. I've even remotely admin'd many of their machines, and even
&gt;production servers.
&gt;
&gt;I have been staff at www.themes.org(now also defunct), and hoping to
&gt;work on what may soon replace it i.e. www.themes.net, been one of the
&gt;founding members of the fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net project, and I am
&gt;currently organising the hosting and web development of
&gt;www.unixhelp.info website for the EFNET #linuxhelp's official webpage
&gt;that will hopefully be online soon.
&gt;
&gt;I have done several stints of tech support work for isp's where I was
&gt;only hired because I knew the sysadmin and the management were desperate
&gt;for someone who could do the job without training and at the drop of a
&gt;hat, and without questioning the pay. I was even told I'm a natural at
&gt;it.
&gt;
&gt;Yet despite all this, I don't even get an interview. I usually just get
&gt;the standard "Thank you for your application...." form letter or email,
&gt;if that. Once they see on my resume that I spent nearly 20 years driving
&gt;taxi's, and nearly 10 before that as a baker, they apparently just reach
&gt;for the next application. 
&gt;

OK, but this is a problem for anyone changing 'careers' :-)

&gt;Recent university graduates must be much more
&gt;appealing since they have no inclination to do other than what they're
&gt;told, and they have the formal training that I lack. All that I know
&gt;I've learned through my own mistakes or by RTFM, and I have no qualms
&gt;about speaking my mind, although with customers my diplomatic skills are
&gt;second to none.
&gt;
This issue here is simply one that those 'university graduates' have 
been moulded into a known quantity. You represent the unknown. You need 
to find some way to stand out. A portfolio of work or references would 
help you here, but there may be other ways to stand out as well.

&gt;
&gt;Okay this mail is as much a bitch as it is an application, but such is
&gt;the job market today! As Malcolm once so eloquently put it...
&gt;"Life wasn't meant to be easy!" C'est la vie!
&gt;
Heh, was that before or after he was found wandering around without his 
trousers :-)

&gt;

&gt;
&gt;P.S. I'm still looking for employment if anyone's willing to give me a
&gt;try.
&gt;P.P.S. Before anyone complains about this email's content please note I
&gt;changed the subject line. Please adjust your spam filters accordingly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;hi all again. im doing my major project for tafe and have to set up a small
&gt;&gt;&gt;network and document it and was wondering if any one out there dossnt mind
&gt;&gt;&gt;me doing some work experience with them for a couple of weeks.if you would
&gt;&gt;&gt;like more information please email me back or ring my mobile on 0410

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Others have made very valid comments about your presentation. Putting it
&gt;&gt;bluntly it's atrocious, but I assure you that if you persist you'll
&gt;&gt;overcome the obstacles and succeed.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;[SIDE NOTE: Toby, it's true what you said but the guy is actually saying
&gt;&gt;it -- give him a break. At least he's got the guts to say what he said.
&gt;&gt;Geez, I wouldn't have gotten to work with one of the Samba team members
&gt;&gt;{hint: he's gone to America} or my current job if I wasn't brazen enough
&gt;&gt;to say, "Hey...I haven't got much real world experience but I've read
&gt;&gt;this and I run Linux at home and have you got any work and I would like
&gt;&gt;to learn from you".
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In the real world I think that people look for enthusiasm and ability as
&gt;&gt;well as presentation. And this guy's presentation might break all
&gt;&gt;grammatical rules in the universe but I'm sure there's more gals and
&gt;&gt;guys like him in the same position who are being silent. I wonder who'll
&gt;&gt;get the work experience...]
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Troy, I'm not sure if I can personally help you but I'm willing to talk
&gt;&gt;to my line manager about your offer. I think you've made the first step,
&gt;&gt;although I would take heed of what Toby has said because the facts he
&gt;&gt;stated are valid (1)...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;DSL
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;(1)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The facts are different from the presentation. Toby, could you please
&gt;&gt;ensure that your base installation contains the "diplomatic.css" next
&gt;&gt;time?
