Doesn't sound that hard to implement.
Allocate the specific memory address (some low level calls requiring
superuser access here) and then mlock() it so it can't be swapped out to
disk and used by something else.

Normally all your memory is "virtual" and doesn't have a linear mapping to
physical memory.. that'd be where the low level calls come in. Can't be too
hard though.. but hey, I'm not volunteering to do the mods ;)

It'd be funny that one of the Pros of Linux is that it has a bad memory
manager.. ;)

Q: "Hey man, how come your PC with faulty ram isn't crashing anymore?"
A: "I installed a bad-memory manager and that fixed it."

&gt; Summary: This page proposes an approach to support RAMs with defective
&gt; addresses, This may open interesting business perspectives, where those
&gt; RAMs can be sold under a white label for less money rather than
&gt; discarded of without any profit.
&gt; Objective of the project
&gt;
&gt; My objective is to patch the Linux kernel in such a way that it can
&gt; handle defective RAM modules. With defective RAM, I mean RAM which has
&gt; some bits wrong at some (known) addresses.
&gt;
&gt; Normally, such RAM is considered useless and thrown away; the larger
&gt; RAMs get, the higher the chances of failing addresses.
&gt; With ever growing RAM sizes, it would therefore be pleasant to have an
&gt; alternative to discarding of defective RAM chips.

&gt; &gt; Hey does anyone know of a program that will isolate bad areas of
&gt; &gt; physical ram ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I know it sounds stupid, but I have an old laptop where the onboard
&gt; &gt; memory is stuffed and I don't really wanna try to find parts for it.
