OK ppl, if this isn't a case for using Linux on servers I dunno what is.

We've got a remote site (300+ km) where theyre running a RH 7.1 / Samba box,
its still running ye olde ext2 because we havent got around to upgrading it
to a journaling fs yet (note to self, schedule an upgrade to RH7.2 + ext3).


Anyway, it shares a UPS with an NT workstation, and for some reason the UPS 
decided not to work when they had a power outage (note to self, replace UPS
ASAP).

Result = one unhappy Linux box with fs corruption, and very unhappy users
who  
cant log on to their workstations (W2k).

It took around half an hour to talk a user (who I'd regard as competent with
Office,
but nothing more :o), thru running e2fsck on the appropriate partitions from
single
user mode (note to self, change root password on said Linux box) and getting
the server 
up and running again.  (This also included time for them to plug in a
monitor to the 
Linux box, as it's headless)

Result = minimal downtime & very happy ppl in userland.

(The last time I had a similar problem with an NT box it cost me a 4hr
Sunday afternoon
drive one way, and the following day and a half to reset the box up from
scratch because it 
bluescreened on bootup and the [insert several expletives here] ERD didn't
work.)

Kudos to Linus once again, Linux 1, NT 0 :o)
