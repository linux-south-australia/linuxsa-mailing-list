&gt; Are there any drawing programs similar to Visio that people 
&gt; recommend for
&gt; use under Linux? I have looked at Qcad, Dia, Kontour, Sketch and a few
&gt; others. Fo me, Dia seems to be the better solution for what I want 
&gt; to do.
&gt; I was wondering if there are any other recent, good drawing 
&gt; programs out
&gt; there (besides Xfig).
&gt; 
&gt; I have played with Dia a bit, but I want to know if anyone has 
&gt; used it for
&gt; long enough to know its good and bad points.
&gt; 
&gt; Dadle.

I have used Dia quite a bit and I highly recommend it. It has never 
crashed on me, I have never lost my drawing. It is easy to use, easy to 
learn and has all the features I need. Symbols, grouping, great text 
labels, etc. I export my diagrams into png, and they look great.
I've used Dia under Windows, Solaris & Linux. Its extremely handy to be 
able to work on your diagrams no matter where you are.

Only two small things,
- I haven't worked out how to get two lines to dock with each other
- it would be nice if it shared a format with Vi$io, but this isn't
  Dia's fault.
