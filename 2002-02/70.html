Hi.

I have tried several free web mail providers including Hotmail and
Yahoo, and am becoming more annoyed with these services, as they do not
provide the depth of features available in many mail clients such as
Netscape Messenger and Mozilla Mail-News.

I'm looking for a mail account I can access most anywhere that has good
filtering, good storage options (such as folders and subfolders), allows
me to store a resonable amount of mail, and is highly reliable.  It
would also be desirable if this client had a web interface so it could
be accessed in any web browser, did not have excessive advertising,
filtered bulk/spam mail, could receive mail sent to a domain I
registered, and provided other features such as downloading all my mail
to a local file.

I have come to think that perhaps an IMAP mail account would be best, as
these features would rely more on the mail client's (MUA's) abilities,
rather than the limited features that most public mail accounts seem to
provide.  It would seem to costly for me to run my own mail server.

Can anybody suggest a public IMAP mail account (free or fee) that
satisfies all these criteria?  Can anybody suggest a web mail account
that does these things?  Any other ideas?

Thanks to anybody who can help.

Regards
