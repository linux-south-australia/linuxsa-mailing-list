Hi Michael,

    Thanks for the tips,
        Eventually found mozilla 0.9.7 with all the associated 
libraries, including Galeon 1.0.2,  in the cooker archives at planetmirror.
Gets me past the immediate problem, Time to work on the next.

Thanks
David Delyn

&gt;&gt;  Hi,
&gt;&gt;Can some one point me in the right direction please.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The Problem
&gt;&gt;I am using Mandrake 8.1 which uses rpmdrake to manage software installation
&gt;&gt;I have updated Mozilla using the online package installation from their 
&gt;&gt;site to install v0.9.8
&gt;&gt;before which I removed the Mozilla rpms installed and the associated 
&gt;&gt;packages which rely on it.
&gt;&gt;Now of these packages I only really wanted to replace Galeon for which I 
&gt;&gt;downloaded the latest RPM 1.0.3.2.
&gt;&gt;However, it stalls on installation requiring Mozilla 0.9.8 as a 
&gt;&gt;dependancy before installation can continue.
&gt;&gt;The latest rpm I can find of Mozilla is v0.9.4.4
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My Question
&gt;&gt;Is there a way to tell the rpm system about tgz installed programs?
&gt;&gt;Ive noticed this before, but as the tgz's and rpm's were independant I 
&gt;&gt;just kept note of the programs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Simple Answer: No.
&gt;
&gt;Complex Answer: You could futz around with the RPM database but I
&gt;wouldn't want to do it.
&gt;
&gt;The best bet is to stay with the RPMs for your distro.  Do you really
&gt;eed the bleeding edge?  If so, Red Hat has "rawhide" RPMS, which are
&gt;pretty much the latest and greatest, but haven't been tested to work
&gt;with everything else, so you can have the latest and greatest if you are
&gt;willing to risk some instability.  Under Manduck I'm not so sure.  You
&gt;could try their Manduck Users Club so whatever it's called - someone may
&gt;have built new RPMs for some newer versions of software.
&gt;
&gt;The other hackish way is to reinstall your old Mozilla via RPMS so the
&gt;database is updated, and then remove the mozilla files (rpm -ql mozilla)
&gt;and insall your tgz.  Or install both mozilla and galeon from tgz and
&gt;not from RPM at all.
&gt;
&gt;But don't do it.  Install a Galeon RPM that matches your Mozilla RPM. 
&gt;You won't have the latest of everything, but it'll all work.
&gt;
