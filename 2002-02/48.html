&gt; Does anyone have any experience with setting up a webcam under linux
&gt; ?   I am thinking of grabbing one of the cheap webcams (ie $50
&gt; special) probably USB and connecting it to the box.   I would like to
&gt; start off capturing the frames and storing them as JPEG's and
&gt; updating a webpage with a timed meta-tag, possibly in the future
&gt; trying real time streaming.   Has anyone done this ?  If so could I
&gt; pinch a few pointers ?

Yep lots of experience! Make sure you know the web cam is supported, 
there are a couple of places on the net you can find this sort of info 
out.

There are heaps of Linux webcam streaming programs out there, some 
quite powerful, at least for the task you seem to want them for. There 
are motion detectors (<A HREF="http://motion.technolust.cx/">http://motion.technolust.cx/</A>), streamers 
(<A HREF="http://www.ee.up.ac.za/~justin/bttv/">http://www.ee.up.ac.za/~justin/bttv/</A>) and many more.

Any reasonably cheap webcam will have been around for a while, and 
should have some decent info about it, though if it is new you will be 
taking a lot more chances.

The webcam I have most experience with is the Philips USB webcam, I 
wrote a frame grabber module for a PCV680K as part of a robotics 
project. The Video4Linux API is not bad, it does have some annoying 
features but these should be ironed out with V4L2 if it ever becomes 
the standard. A good example of code for Video4Linux devices can be 
found in CamStream (<A HREF="http://www.smcc.demon.nl/camstream/">http://www.smcc.demon.nl/camstream/</A>).

Linux works very well with webcams (those that are supported anyway). I 
had two USB webcams (352x288 at 30 fps) running on a Linux box 
simultaneously, without dropping a frame for at least 8 hours.

good luck
