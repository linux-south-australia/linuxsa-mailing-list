I was told (unconfirmed) that it was patent problems on the delay. The
work around was some other S register where you could set the escape
sequence to one of the other 255 characters. It didnt fix the problem,
but it was the best you could do with those modems. (yes I had one, and
had people +++ATH ing me to drop out my conenction :(

&gt; Umm.. that's pretty wierd behaviour.
&gt; You should be able to send those strings without dropping your modem out!
&gt; 
&gt; The Hayes standard used to say the escape sequences was +++, but that the
&gt; sequence had to be preceded and followed by a long pause.
&gt; So, your email containing the +++ characters shouldn't cause a hangup, as
&gt; the required pauses either side of the sequence didn't exist.
&gt; 
&gt; However, there were some modems which copied the Hayes spec, but didnt
&gt; implement it correctly. These modems were also vulnerable to the ping-hangup
&gt; exploit. This is where someone pings you with the data sequence containing
&gt; +++ATH, thus causing your machine to echo it back, and hang up your own
&gt; modem!
&gt; 
&gt; I'd reccommend you upgrade the modem's firmware, or get a working modem,
&gt; rather than trying to kludge your way around the problem.
