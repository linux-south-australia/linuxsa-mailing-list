&gt; Hi all -- I was wondering what do people think about the recent (last 6
&gt; months, perhaps) rash of messages regarding ISPs recently... Personally,
&gt; I think they tend to border on commercial postings, and as such, maybe
&gt; should be taken off-list... However, it's definitely a subject that
&gt; people are interested in, and is kinda relevant to Linux, particuarly as
&gt; we like to download ISOs and so on.

I don't have a problem with the "rash" of messages. The thing is, it's
not like the majority of the ISP-related threads have been instigated by
the ISP owners/workers.

Let's not "beat around the bush" now. A large percentage of the
ISP-related traffic has (in one way or another) wound up having
something to do with Internode. I think that's fine, so long as we're
not excluding other ISPs from having a say.

... and I don't think that there is any exclusion going on, as the
discussion going on here is generally based on the truth -- Internode
provide a helluva lot better products than many (if not all) of their
competitors.

&gt; The problem here, in my reckoning, is that there are many ISPs in
&gt; Adelaide, ranging in their stance on Linux (and BSD and OSS) from being
&gt; on this list, to those who pass you to the MS support line if you
&gt; mention "Linx". They also range from crap to really good, slow to fast,
&gt; cheap to expensive and so on. I'm sure that even most ISP types would
&gt; (perhaps reluctantly) agree with me if I said that this diversity is
&gt; good for consumers. However, on this list, we run the risk of becoming
&gt; rather non-neutral ground in regards to ISPs.

I don't really agree. It's not like Internode host the list or anything
like that, so there's need to worry about offending anyone. If Internode
are doing something crappy, we've all got the right to complain
(hopefully to them first, then voicing it on the list).

The same goes for any ISP. Telstra cop an awful lot of flack on this
list, but that's because they don't know their arse from their elbow. In
essence, criticism of them is warranted.

The thing is interesting for me is that apart from Internode, there
doesn't really seem to be any other ISP taking an interest in this list
and its members.

&gt; I consider this to be a bad thing. I don't know if I'm alone here or
&gt; not, but I'd like to think that LinuxSA was a safe place to discuss
&gt; things relevant (eg ISPs) without too much salesmanship. For eg, we
&gt; recently had some discussion on IDE RAID cards, and a few were
&gt; mentioned, a few criticised... However, if this were to happen regarding
&gt; ISPs, we would immediately have large-scale discussions on the relative
&gt; merits of one ISP over another, or why one way of doing is is best or
&gt; whatever... (well, maybe we wouldn't, but that's the feeling I get...)

The thing that I've noticed with ISP-related issues that have input from
Internode is the fact that there's rarely any blatant "use us" in their
e-mail messages. Simon generally says "There are other alternatives to
Telstra". The fact that they're the most attractive is neither here nor
there, really.

&gt; So, what I suggest is that either we invite ISPs across the board to
&gt; have a regular speil, or we try to restrict sales-related discussion to
&gt; offline only. Of course, there's a lot of technical stuff that's
&gt; relevant, but it does border on salesmanship sometimes... also, a number
&gt; of ISP types do contribute a lot of technical stuff to the list, but
&gt; then, so do people from a large number of other organisations... Other
&gt; organisations also occasionally make commercial announcements (I have
&gt; been known to do this occasionally), but these are usually one-offs,
&gt; informational, and request follow-ups to be taken off-line...

If ISPs want to poke their noses in here, let them. If we start
receiving bucket-loads of commercial cruft, then deal with it on a
case-by-case basis. It's not really necessary to define a cover-all rule
right now.

&gt; What do people think about this -- is this an issue that bothers more
&gt; than just me?

Well, it certainly doesn't bother me. Like I said, the majority of the
ISP-related stuff that contains salesmanship is generally in a response
to an unhappy customer's complaint about their ISP.

There's no need to make a mountain out of a molehill.
