&gt; If Sun lose sight of the fact that StarOffice is being developed

Dont forget before star division was bought by sun star office was not
open source, nor completely free. Sun bought it with their $$$, sun open
sourced the openoffice version, and the original codebase was written by
star division.

I think it is a good compromise to have star office and open office. It
provides a way to keep most people happy, and provide at least a minimal
revenue for them. They are a business after all.

Its kinda similar to the wineX guys. They sell wineX, and yet they still
provide the source for free from CVS for those able and willing to
download and compile it. It keeps them from starving while working on it
all day, every day, and keeps the "I wont pay a cent for anything, and
wine is open source anyway" crowd happy (which there is nothing wrong
with either). I must say that wineX works pretty well and got developed
pretty quickly, and if those people had to work on something else during
the day for money, and it was just hobby development at night would not
have been so quick. 

Remember there is a software industry out there, and people do live off
income from software development. I am happy to see people make a fair
amount of money for a fair amount of work. Its just the rip off
merchants I am against. Too this end I like these compromises between
selling and giving away software. Hopefully it can keep compays running,
without creating billionaires who did bugger all of the work themselves.

I do realise that there are exceptions to these rules and if you want to
get picky you can compare my statements to this specific scenareo or
what ever, but I just mean to put a couple of general points forward.
