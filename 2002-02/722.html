&gt; Essentially, I want to set up DHCP on my Linux box (Mandrake 8.0)
&gt; as a DHCP server. My goal?
&gt; 
&gt; To play GOLF with a friend in Melbourne routing through both our
&gt; linux boxes. The theory is this, we both have windows machines,
&gt; (mine win2k, his not sure) with our Windows LINKS golf, and both
&gt; want these routing through our linux boxes.

It will require more than DHCP to get this up and running.  DHCP
would be used to assign an IP address and default gateway to the
Win2K/whichever boxes on the local LAN segment.

&gt; Theoretically, we ought to be able to achieve a link-up over
&gt; direct modem together with the game thinking it is on a LAN.

That depends on how your golf game communicates and discovers
other golf games (if it does this through broadcasts, it becomes
difficult, but if you can specify the IP address of the remote
peer, then that makes it easier).

Routing will have to be handled by your box and the remote end.
In a subsequent message you state that this isn't being routed
over the Internet proper, but being routed peer to peer.  This
means that you will have to set up one end of the link as a PPP
server and have the other machine dial into it.  This probably
rules out the requirement for NAT, but you will still need to
set up different subnets at either end of the link.
