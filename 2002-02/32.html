 &gt; &gt; Quite aside from the exposure that'd result for our customers, it'd also

 &gt; 
 &gt; give an option to those clever enough to
 &gt; a) not use IIS (after all this is a linux list!!)
 &gt; b) setup their own protection the option to do so at their end (something
 &gt; like smoothwall) and take the responsibility of security themselves maybe??
 
That option exists -- on the "traditional" plans.

I mean, seriously, how many residential users require the ability
to run an SMTP server?  On a dynamic IP address?  

I don't deny that there are some;  I also don't deny that the residents
of this mailing list are probably among the most likely to fit that
profile.  But we can't design a mass-market product around an edge-case
(especially when we provide a completely open alternative, at prices
which remain rational and competitive).

 &gt; granted we can change ports etc, but as Mark Mills said, port 25 is a
 &gt; problem
 
But ask yourself:  Is the difficulty involved in running an SMTP server
important enough to make the difference?  At the end of the day, that's
essentially the only thing you can't do as a result of us blocking ports.

We have spent a lot of time to come up with an outcome which is (a)
better, and (b) MUCH cheaper than any of our competitors.  It's
understandable that there are details which some people will decide
they don't like, but I'm pretty confident that we're still better than
anyone else in the marketplace.

 &gt; and with regards to the contract, what is the problem with dont pay, dont
 &gt; get service.. to me thats simple considering you would be paying up front
 &gt; (except extra data fees)

It's only three months.  After that everything is monthly, you can decide
on a month by month basis whether you want to continue the service.

It isn't a service based on 3-month contracts.  It's a monthly service, 
with a three month minimum.

 &gt; also I am also unaware of your links with Internode.?! ( a lot of we've's in
 &gt; the email! :)

You'd be the only one who doesn't know :-)
