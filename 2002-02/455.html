Hi all,

Last night I was called in to have a look at a proxy server that I had set up about 4 months ago that was no longer working. The
service would start and then exit immediately with "signal 25". After some investigation, I found that this was due to the store.log
and access.log being rather large (2Gb and 750Mb respectively).

Also the 5gb cache partition that I had created (thought it should be enough for a while) was already full.

This machine is mainly accessed by a local council and library where they have public interenet access so it gets a bit of a
hammering from them. I am guessing this is why the logs and cache got so large so quickly.

Is there a way in squid to limit the amount of logging that it does or am I better off just rotating the logs every week or so?

Many thanks

Damien Wilson
