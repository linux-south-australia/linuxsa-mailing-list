Quoting "nik [tm]" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:tmcruisin@sond.com.au">tmcruisin@sond.com.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; &gt; But ask yourself:  Is the difficulty involved in running an SMTP server
&gt; &gt; important enough to make the difference?  At the end of the day, that's
&gt; &gt; essentially the only thing you can't do as a result of us blocking ports.
&gt; 
&gt; If you know that everyone can sidestep this by changing ports the services
&gt; run on?? why bother?
Because of open relays. If you have a misconfigured mailserver which is 
running on a non-standard port, it is unlikely that a spammer will find it.
However, if you're running an open relay on port 25, your server will be
abused until you notice the increased log entries/traffic or your ISP tells
you about it.

Every time an open relay popped up at SE-Net, it took a couple of hours
of a system administrator's time to block the relay, contact the customer,
explain to them what an open relay is (and sometimes what a mailserver is)
and how one can be fixed. Now, imagine that on a residential customer scale
instead of the limited business customer scale.

&gt; you are basically making a lot of extra work for no-real-reason. with the
&gt; end result of one blocked service.
&gt; isnt it a better option to setup a port scan so you can check and advise
&gt; your clients of possible vunerabilities - (after all you are soo concerned
&gt; about being responsible network citizens)
They're also concerned about responsibility for _your_ benefit: 
an open relay or a compromised system (think Code Red) can rack up a very
large bandwidth bill.

&gt; I look at it that if I pay a premium price (and for a residential user $100
&gt; a month is premium price) I expect a premium service, without limitations
&gt; on
&gt; anything except maybe a data cap and IP.. DHCP takes the issues of servers
&gt; away from those with less experience.
No, it doesn't. Many use dyndns.org to run servers.

&gt; &gt; It's only three months.  After that everything is monthly, you can decide
&gt; &gt; on a month by month basis whether you want to continue the service.
&gt; 
&gt; a contract is a contract, 3 years or 3 months.. and even more bitter when I
&gt; have been waiting for this service for a while and have assurances that
&gt; Internode dont do contracts..
Mark's correct. 3 months is nothing. I assume it is there so that 
Internode actually get a decent return on time spent setting up your
connection.
