&gt; Comments?

OK, I now have another idea, which I think is even cooler than other
ideas...

I recall User Mode Linux from a meeting a while back... Now it had a
nifty filesystem. IIRC, you could have a master FS (which would actually
be a file within a filesystem), and then have a number of files which
contained the differences between the master and themselves... From
browsing the UML site, this seems to be called the ubd driver for
layered block devices... It seems to allow Copy on Write onto the slave
fs's... Which would be cool...

You could simply copy (rsync, tar, dump, etc) your live fs to a new
master fs, then for incrementalys, create new copy on write layed block
devices, using the same method -- rsync or whatever -- and then you
could just remount them read only, and away you go... Cool...

Does anyone think this would be a dumb idea? Have I missed the obvious
"you can't do that because foo will stop you from mounting it
afterwards"?

Is anyone who is more familiar with UML than I am able to shed any light
on what it would take to get just the "ubd" driver into a normal kernel
(preferably as a module, as it would only be user data...) I've hunted
around, but can't see it as a separate project anywhere (though a couple
of kernel changlogs make mention of it -- I can't really make sense of
whether I can just ad it to a normal kernel...)
