Toby: Well that is probably true - but I think you've just given some
student a rude response with that. I also wasn't aware that they would
do that kind of research you mentioned at TAFE.

Troy: This is coming from someone who has had to apply for holiday work
over my time at uni. I mainly applied through the old fashion snail mail
process, but I would imagine these are a few good pointers for online
submissions:

- In your email detail out what you are after and what you can offer.
- Check and double check grammar and spelling please.
- Do some research and limit your queries to suitable organizations and
people.
- If you do speak to someone interested, explain what you've done in the
past and how that can benefit them in a particular job.

I think most employers will not be interested in just any student. I've
seen and heard of situations where a new hire did more harm than good
over their work experience period. Some amount of professionalism has to
be shown. If this is new to you, better learn fast.

Cheers,

&gt; Just a suggestion.. You might find that better presentation helps.
&gt; Potential employers may be quick to judge you based on your email skills.
&gt; 
&gt; For instance, I could come to the conclusion that you don't know what the
&gt; "Enter" key is used for. I could also be quite confused because you have two
&gt; apparently seperate concepts merged into one sentance, without even a single
&gt; comma to help us work out your intentions.
&gt; 
&gt; No-one wants to help someone do their homework, without some kind of mutual
&gt; help back. You might want to try writing something about what your major
&gt; research topic is, and then aim your emails towards potential employers who
&gt; could *benefit* from that research.
&gt; (Eg. If you've done a lot of research into ways to improve caching
&gt; storage length determination algorithms, or asymmetric
&gt; least cost for minimum service requirements routing, then you could offer to
&gt; employers to do work experience practicing the implementation of the above
&gt; on their systems.)
&gt; 
&gt; As it stands, it sounds a bit like you're saying you need to learn how to
&gt; setup a network, and you'd like someone to teach you for free for a couple
&gt; of weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; Is your TAFE teaching Linux networking and routing? If so, I'm impressed.
&gt; If not, well, you might be asking the wrong list..
