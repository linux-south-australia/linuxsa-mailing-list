&gt; A lot of effort has gone into trying to strike a balance between

&gt; to provide.

&gt; Your comments, as always, are welcome. And so (at last!), are your orders :)

&gt; See <A HREF="http://adsl.internode.on.net">http://adsl.internode.on.net</A>
&gt; For the good stuff.

Well the pricing and data caps look excellent (shame my local exchange
isn't ADSL enabled as yet), but then I noticed it's not 24x7.

I only have a few requirements of my internet connection, those being:

a) 24x7
b) no port blocking
c) and about 1.5Gb data pre month (download).

I don't need support from my ISP, but would have a preference for a
fixed IP but can live without it.

I have a small network at home, which I do run mail and web services
on, neither are for business purposes (purely for my own geekiness
really - but it's handy to check up on the computer room webcam from
work).

However, do you think it's possible to get such a service at a fixed
but affordable price? Nup - everyone lumps me into the "business" plan
category and want major $$$.

Oh, well, have to stick with my current dial-up (and multiple redials
per day) for now...
