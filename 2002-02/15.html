I hope y'all like it.

A lot of effort has gone into trying to strike a balance between 
charging a fair price, and ensuring that the service is sustainable 
to provide.

Your comments, as always, are welcome. And so (at last!), are your orders :)

See
	<A HREF="http://adsl.internode.on.net">http://adsl.internode.on.net</A>

For the good stuff.

(Especially the "more information" link, as well as (of course) the 
price list and order form links)

Orders taken now. Provisioning begins next week, with first service 
deliveries expected from the week after that. Now would be a great 
time to cancel your Telstra ADSL service and make the move.

NB for people who -are- moving from Telstra, note that you -do- need 
to disconnect with Telstra before we can reconnect you via Internode. 
There isn't any 'cleaner' way, and it does mean you'll have no 
broadband for a few days in the middle.

However, we do supply you with access to a nationally available dial 
account as an included part of our service, perfect for that 
transition period :)

[And, again, see the 'more information' link for other cool features as well]

Regards,
   Simon Hackett
