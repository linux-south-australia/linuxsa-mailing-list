A problem with breaking up one company into several is thus:
Multiple privatised companies all try to make a profit. The cumalative
profit margin at the end of the line has, in practice, often been higher
than before the company was split up.

&gt; &gt; What does privatizing Telstra have to do with it?  Personally I think
&gt; &gt; that'd be one of the /worst/ outcomes:  At least they currently have
&gt; &gt; to put up the pretense of community service;  The only motive they'd
&gt; &gt; have if they were 100% privately owned would be profit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; /Then/ you'd see their monopolistic tendencies come to the fore...
&gt;
&gt; However, at the moment you have a big problem and that is the Government has
&gt; two rolls: one as owner of Telstra second as regulator.  Because they have
&gt; conflicting rolls we end up that because they want to sell Telstra soon
&gt; they're happy to allow Telstra to run up big profits at the moment (jacking
&gt; up prices, reducing spending) to get the best price for it later.
&gt;
&gt; At least if they sold it off they'd be happier to regulate it more closely.
&gt;
&gt; Not that ultimately I think that'd work either, I think they need to divide
&gt; Telstra into separate companies - eg. longhaul (interstate), local (eg. last
&gt; mile copper, local loop etc) and services (internet, switching, etc) - this
&gt; would allow companies to buy services more easily from Telstra where it has
&gt; a true monopoly (local loop) and compete more sucessfully in others (eg.
&gt; internet).
&gt;
&gt; However, we get back to the problem that the Govt is the owner and wants to
&gt; maximise sale price and so won't break it up because it'd reduce the sell
&gt; price.
