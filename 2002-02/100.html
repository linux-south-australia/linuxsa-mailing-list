VERY NICE!
so for me, the only problem is the changing IP address each 18 hours. 

*i'd like to see telstra altering their plans in such a situation :) hehehe

Thanks,

&gt;now I have read Simons email and am aware he is looking into ways to
improve
&gt;this and will be waiting before I sign up ( I would sign up tomorrow if
&gt;there was no port filtering) to see what Internode come up with.

Hi Nik,

As of today, we've decided to make the port filtering OPTIONAL.

So if you don't want it, you don't have to have it.

Fly, be free :)

[Also - we've decided not to introduce it until late March 2002, 
rather than doing it straight away. That's so we can do the 
engineering to allow the use of the feature to be customer selected 
rather than mandatory. How's that for linuxsa inspired service 
adjustments :) ]

These changes are reflected in a new version of the pdf files, which 
I have just put online on the web site at <A HREF="http://adsl.internode.on.net">http://adsl.internode.on.net</A>

So you should fill in the form, and fax it off to us on 08 8223 1777 
- we'll look out for your order as promised above, since we've done 
what you asked for, and you promised you'd sign up if we did  :)

[...]

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  It isn't a service based on 3-month contracts.  It's a monthly service,
&gt;&gt;  with a three month minimum.
&gt;
&gt;it doesnt state that in your price list - it clearly states;
&gt;'a quarterly contract applies to this service'
&gt;that in legal terms means in 3 month blocks..
&gt;but thats only your wording that is incorrect.
&gt;

This was a mistake in the form. Put it down to eagerness to get the 
thing out on Friday.

It should have said 'a minimum three month term applies'. That's all 
we ever meant to say.

Corrected words are in the new pdf file, that you can download as of 
now, to clear this up.

Regards,
    Simon
