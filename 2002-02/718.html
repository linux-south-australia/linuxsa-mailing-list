No, that should work just fine.

Also, you can convert NTFS or FAT32 partitions to ext2 or reiser easily with
a similar method:

Just set the partition type away from 06 (fat16) to 83 (linux), then run
mkfs.ext2 -S /dev/hda1
(-S means "only re-create superblocks)
It might say you should make backups n stuff, but eh, who ever makes those?

;)

&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

Umm, anyway.... in case you haven't realised, you won't be able to use your
method to swap to RAID. Before you can mount the /dev/md0 device, you have
to make a filesystem upon it - either ext2, ext3, reiserfs, even iso9660.
As you know, creating a new filesystem will depreciate your ability to
access the previous filesystem's data. This rule holds true in situations
involving RAID as well.

Sorry, but you'll need to do the dump/restore method of converting to raid
instead.

RAID can be confusing, and the doco isn't always brilliant... its pretty out
of date too in places, just increasing the confusion.

&gt; Hi All
&gt;
&gt; I want to upgrade a box to a raid 1 mirror, I do not want to remove all the
&gt; software and create the raid and copy the software back.
&gt;
&gt; So I want the list opinion the following upgrade plan. (for this example I
&gt; have only two partitions '/' and swap)
&gt;
&gt; 1. Modify the hda to have a partition type of fd (auto raid)
&gt; 2. Copy partition table to hdc (using sfdisk)
&gt; 3. Create raidtab file so that hda1 and hdc1 are part of a raid 1 mirror
&gt; 4. Run mkraid /dev/md0
&gt;         From my reading this creates a superblock on both drives and parts
&gt; copying all the data on hda to hdc.
&gt;         Do I need to do this from a boot cd or floppy so that hda1 is not
&gt; mounted ?
&gt; 5. Adjust fstab to have '/' point at /dev/md0
&gt;     Adjust fstab to have swap point look like this
&gt;         /dev/hda2       swap           swap    defaults,pri=1   0 0
&gt;         /dev/hdc2       swap           swap    defaults,pri=1   0 0
&gt; 6. Reboot
&gt;
&gt; Does any one see any problems with this ?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;     Mike O'Connor
