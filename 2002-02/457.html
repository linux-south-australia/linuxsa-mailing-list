Daniel,

&gt; Last night I was called in to have a look at a proxy server 
&gt; that I had set up about 4 months ago that was no longer working. The
&gt; service would start and then exit immediately with "signal 
&gt; 25". After some investigation, I found that this was due to 
&gt; the store.log and access.log being rather large (2Gb and 750Mb respectively).

You can turn of the store.log in the config file - it serves very little purpose.

You can probably turn of the access.log too if you arent going to use it for anything.

&gt; Also the 5gb cache partition that I had created (thought it 
&gt; should be enough for a while) was already full.

Squid should automatically keep its cache size at or below what you set in the squid
config file - make sure you have specified a value that is equal to or less than the 
partition size in which you are storing the cache data.
 
&gt; Is there a way in squid to limit the amount of logging that 
&gt; it does or am I better off just rotating the logs every week or so?

If you dont need the logs for anything - better to turn them off. Instructions are in
the squid.conf file.

Hope this helps!

Michael.
