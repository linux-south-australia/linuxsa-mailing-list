Umm.. that's pretty wierd behaviour.
You should be able to send those strings without dropping your modem out!

The Hayes standard used to say the escape sequences was +++, but that the
sequence had to be preceded and followed by a long pause.
So, your email containing the +++ characters shouldn't cause a hangup, as
the required pauses either side of the sequence didn't exist.

However, there were some modems which copied the Hayes spec, but didnt
implement it correctly. These modems were also vulnerable to the ping-hangup
exploit. This is where someone pings you with the data sequence containing
+++ATH, thus causing your machine to echo it back, and hang up your own
modem!

I'd reccommend you upgrade the modem's firmware, or get a working modem,
rather than trying to kludge your way around the problem.
