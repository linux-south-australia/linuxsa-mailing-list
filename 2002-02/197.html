Update : I have been told by another friendly Telstra Rep that what I was
told yesterday is "crap". The 3 gig is for the month regardless.
If you cancel your contract due to changes in the AUP you have to advise
them before midnight on the 14th and you won't get disconnected till 1st
March 2002.
If you have a month left on your contract ( Like I do ) - I could use my 3
gig tonight ..cancel my contract tomorrow. They would then cut me off
immediately and the only charge I would have to pay is the Pro rata monthly
charge and a cancellation charge of about $25 to enable me to keep the
modem.

They refused to provide this for me in writing however

&gt;
&gt; I just got off the phone to a rather rude ( to be expected )
&gt; Telstra rep to
&gt; whom I asked the question.
&gt; "If I Downloaded 3 gig in the first 2 weeks of this month and
&gt; then cancel
&gt; the T$ contract what happens ?"
&gt;
&gt; I was told if you cancel mid term your gig allowance for that
&gt; month is Pro
&gt; rata, you will be up for $285 or just a tad more for excess
&gt; usage charges
&gt; for February.
&gt;
&gt; Something to be aware of if you are thinking of dumping the big T$
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt;
