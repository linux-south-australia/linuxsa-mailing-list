&gt; Hi Toby,
&gt;
&gt; If you wanted static IP, we have a different product that offers that
&gt; feature (and several others) over and above the feature set of
&gt; Personal ADSL.

It's ok, I understand that difference - I wasn't meaning to ask about static
IPs since thats been worked over on linuxsa a few times already.. I was just
curious to know why the 18 hour lease length was chosen, and named so
precisely, as opposed to, say, a 24 or 42 hour period. I think i understand
why now.



&gt; We ain't Telstra. If you want to keep ripping someone off, stay with
&gt; Telstra cable, for both our sakes. Really.  They can absorb the
&gt; fruits of their own stupidity for ages, and the only casualty is
&gt; their share price (doesn't matter to me, I'm not a shareholder).

For what it's worth, after the initial couple of months, i haven't
downloaded even a gig of "accountable data" per month since.
(My housemates, on the other hand, would love to have more than 1gb each and
are happy to reach into the spare bandwidth if left over)

The thing with having fast links is that it feels like a bit of a waste to
not be able to use it.. I'd like to be able to come home and connect to a
high-quality streaming radio station, and leave that running until evening
-- but i can't, because that chews up way too much of the quota.
Or the other day, I downloaded one CD of the mandrake beta for a friend who
wanted to genuinely test it out (it wasn't just for some sort of
zero-day-leetness) -- however thats almost 3/4 of the monthly quota for me,
gone in 4 hours.

It just seems a bit silly to pay-per-meg, when the link and the link
maintenance costs, are basically setup+pay-per-time. I mean, its not like
the coax or fibre or satellites will wear out slower if there's less data
going over the cable, right?

Anyway, this has strayed far enuf off the original topic.


Good on Internode for providing some competition, anyway! ;)

Toby


&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Simon

&gt; &gt;Hmm.. Does it actually force a change on you, or is more like a "we just
&gt; &gt;don't gaurantee you'll have it for any longer, but actually if you stay
&gt; &gt;up you'll probably keep it for weeks" ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I've had telstra cable broadband for 6 months, and i think i can count the
&gt; &gt;IPs i've had on one hand.. i appreciate that. That and the fact its been
&gt; &gt;an effectively unlimited cap until last month. ,)

&gt; &gt;&gt;  VERY NICE!
&gt; &gt;&gt;  so for me, the only problem is the changing IP address each 18 hours.
