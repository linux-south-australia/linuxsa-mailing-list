Nice. Very nice...

Option to rsync would be very cool... Otherwise, I'd be keen to take a
gander at your scripts...  (as would Duncan, I imagine)...

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I had exacly the same problem but you don't need any special 
&gt; file system, just use hard links.  If a file is the same then 
&gt; just hard link it to the last version else create a new copy 
&gt; of the file.  The directory strucure is recreated the same as 
&gt; the working directory (links don't replace directories).
&gt; 
&gt; This, of course, doesn't work well if you have a lot of large 
&gt; files with small changes.  We use it here at work and there 
&gt; is no problems with efficiency, and of course backup access 
&gt; time is as good as it gets.  
&gt; 
&gt; Restoring is easy as cp -a.  
&gt; 
&gt; One cool feature of using hard links is that you can delete 
&gt; any incremental backup (with a simple rm -rf command) and the 
&gt; rest of the backups remain consistant.  So if your backup 
&gt; disk runs out of space you can just remove older incrementals 
&gt; or make them less regular by deleting a few of them (say you 
&gt; keep daily backups for a month then after that you only keep 
&gt; weeklies, then all you need to do is go back a month and 
&gt; delete 6 out of every 7 incremental backups).
&gt; 
&gt; I have a few simple scripts which do all of this for you.  
&gt; I've been meaning to rewrite them in C (or as a option to 
&gt; rsync) but I've not had the time (plus they run quick enough 
&gt; as is).  I run them each night as our onsite backups.  Works 
&gt; a treat.  You can have them if you like (or you can pay me 
&gt; for them :-))
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi all...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was just discussing with a friend some techniques for 
&gt; keeping large 
&gt; &gt; backups online, and remembered Union File Systems... I 
&gt; believe FreeBSD 
&gt; &gt; does these nicely, but, for reasons involving other 
&gt; software, Linux is 
&gt; &gt; required in this situation -- does anyone know of how close 
&gt; union fs's 
&gt; &gt; are for Linux? Is there a core project out there? Is anyone 
&gt; willing to 
&gt; &gt; pay for it to be done?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've done some brief searching around, and have come across 
&gt; something 
&gt; &gt; called IFS (Inherited File System) and TFS (Translucent 
&gt; File System --
&gt; &gt; Sun) ... But not real sure what the status is on these...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also, in this specific instance, the idea that I have 
&gt; running around 
&gt; &gt; in my head is pretty specific... I'd want:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Say four complete backups, that look like live filesystems, but are 
&gt; &gt; mounted read-only for users...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Eg:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; /thisweek
&gt; &gt; /lastweek
&gt; &gt; /theweekbefore
&gt; &gt; /theweekbeforethat
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Then within each of these, there would be a directory for 
&gt; the backup 
&gt; &gt; of each day:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; /weekend (full, done on sat or sun)
&gt; &gt; /monday
&gt; &gt; /tuesday
&gt; &gt; /wednesday
&gt; &gt; /thursday
&gt; &gt; /friday
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Monday through to Friday would be effectively incremental 
&gt; backups, but 
&gt; &gt; mounted on top of weekend (or on top of all the previous days), so 
&gt; &gt; they look like full FS's.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The idea would be that once per week, you could do a 
&gt; dump/restore (or 
&gt; &gt; tar c/tar x or etc) to create the weekly backup, and then 
&gt; every night, 
&gt; &gt; use rsync, dump, or whatever, to create the difference 
&gt; filesystems... 
&gt; &gt; After this, they could all be read-only, as you 
&gt; specifically wouldn't 
&gt; &gt; want to change anything anyway...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So it doesn't really need to be a proper live union FS, 
&gt; just one that 
&gt; &gt; I can create, then have read-only...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Of course, one option that I thought of was Katie, but I 
&gt; don't know if 
&gt; &gt; it's production ready yet, and it may be too slow to use on 
&gt; hundred MB 
&gt; &gt; plus fs's...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Comments?
