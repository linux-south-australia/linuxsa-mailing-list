&gt; There was a Solaris 2.0 to 2.3 which was run in parallel to
&gt; SunOS 4.1.3.  2.0,2.1,2.2 were basically releases so people could see
&gt; what was happening they were quite useless as usable operating systems.
&gt; 2.3 was okay, it could be used.
&gt;
&gt; However, 2.4 was the first really useful version with 2.5.1 being
&gt; probably the first production ready version as it had many patches
&gt; and performance enhancements.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, it was called Solaris prior to 2.4, I'm sure I have a selection of
&gt; coasters to prove it :-)

The name "Solaris" was retrofitted round the introduction of SunOS 5.
SunOS 5.0 was the kernel for the "Operating System" Solaris 2.0.  At
the same time, SunOS 4 became Solaris 1.  I have plenty of Sun CD-ROMs
to prove that one :-)
