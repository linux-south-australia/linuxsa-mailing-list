&gt;But why does a perm connection using any of those methods cost
&gt;more than perm ADSl??

It's just one of those things.

With a permanent dialup connection, you are paying for 2 phone lines, one on
your end and one on the isp end. You're also paying for a port on a dialup
server that probably cost a lot if it supports 56K or ISDN.

So, generally the $55/month is the ISP paying for a $25-30/month phone line
that's committed to you (it's not like they can make any other money off it
if you're on 24/7) and an access server that cost somewhere in the realm of
$20K-$100K depending on the maker and it's capacity.

Presumably you're also paying for switching logic, billing services and
support for the Telco voice network, but given the costs of implementing
ADSL that arguement is a bit thin.

 Blame it on Telstra for charging the ISP for a line when they collect money
as a result of people calling it. Some other Telco's (AAPT, Optus) recognise
this and charge ISP's less, some even better Telco's (Chime) use this to
subsidise lines for ISP's.

The ISP could try and make money off the data, selling Internet is the
primary function of an ISP after all, but most permanent line customers
don't use a lot of data. Which is why the prices per megabyte are usually in
the high-teens. Download a lot of data, get a better deal from your ISP.

ADSL pricing is somewhat skewed, partly because of the expectations set by
Telstra with their initial ADSL offering, and because bandwidth, like
everything else, gets cheaper with volume.
