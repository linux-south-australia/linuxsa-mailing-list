Glen,

I used a TSL-11000 (holds 8 DDS-4 (40GB each) tapes).  Nice tape drive
and worked fine with tar and the tape utils (mtx tools).  I assume the
one you want is similar.

It did fail at one stage with a weird intermittent problem.  I thought
I'd have little chance at getting it fixed since it was so
intermittent but the local Sony people (down at Thebarton) were really
good.  They took it (gave us a replacement) and ran it on their tester
for a number of hours, found the problem, tired to fix it, reran the
drive on the tester (which showed the problem went away) and then gave
it back to us.  After that the drive ran fine.  I was really
impressesed (all under warranty ofcourse).

.. and yes you have to manually change the tapes over.  tar does have
an option to run a command when you hit the end of a volume but I
never bothered to use it (having to search thru a tar backup which is
&gt; 40GB is a pain/slow).

If you want to use tapes, then I would recommend the drive.
