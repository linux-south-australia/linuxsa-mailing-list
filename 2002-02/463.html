&gt; 1)
&gt;  Since the FAT has been corrupted won't Linux display the same results
&gt; as XP?

Yes. Although in some cases I've seen Linux deal with corrupted drives
better due to sanity checks.. But in this case I don't think it'll help
much. If the drive says a file is called Foo, both windows and linux will
report it as Foo. Linux's rep as being good for recovering drives comes more
from experiences recovering half-dead drives which report many bad reads.
In those circumstances Linux tends to re-read a lot to try and get the
sector, and even if it gives up, keeps reading and guesses. Windows 9x and
dos used to come up with an abort/retry/fail message or BSOD instead making
them useless for recovery.

&gt;
&gt; 2)
&gt;  Is there any possible way of recovering the data on the drive with
&gt; Linux?

Yes, but its known as "the hard way" -- grab a low-level fat32 filesystem
tool, and start plowing thru looking for disconnected directories. (ie. real
ones from before, which are no-longer linked to from the root, since the
root is wrong)
You can do this from DOS as well - its more about the tool you're using than
the O/S for this stage.

After you've found your directories, you have to go and rebuild the FAT
tables. You do this by going to the start of the files as pointed to by the
directory entries, and then walking along the file's sectors, entering them
into the FAT. When you find what looks like a gap in the file, you'll have
to search the disk for the next cluster, then keep going.

This can take abso-bleep-inglutely ages to do, even for a very small amount
of data. I've done it once before on a drive that had the FAT and root
directory entry zero-ed out - but i was only trying to recover a few files
off the disk, not the entire disk. Even so, it took hours with Norton 4.5
diskeditor and a notepad.

&gt;
&gt; 3)
&gt;  Does anyone know of a program for Linux or Windows (pref one for each)
&gt; that reads
&gt;  the physical surface of the hdd in Hex/Ascii or allows bin/hex/ascii
&gt; editing
&gt;  of the drive surface itself.

"less -f" and "vim -b" ? ;)
