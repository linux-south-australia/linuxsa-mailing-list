<PRE>
I've been playing with Sorcery for a little while...

It's not really that reliable, but it does OK. It's lacking a lot of
polish (for eg the init.d scripts are fairly sparse and occasionally
fragile -- my network interface won't get configured if the system
crashed before the last boot, as there is a .pid file left around that
stops dhcpcd from starting... hence, I can't log in (headless system --
ssh only), and have to mess around with heads...)

It also takes ages to compile, and documentation is a little poor...
However, it seems to work (I've only got a _very_ basic system up,
running almost nothing, but it's been up for days now)... it's fragile
when you recompile or update, and that process takes literally ages...
the other problem with it is that it asks questions, which time out if
not answered in time, and end up going with defaults you don't
neccessarily want... and then you can't interrupt it as you may cause
instability.

This questions-at-random-points seems to be a problem with almost all
package systems that I like -- .deb/apt, BSD ports, and sorcery/grimoire
-- they can run for hours, but require your attention to answer
occasionally dumb questions at random moments in the
upgrade/recompile/configure/whatever process... Sometimes these
questions are dumb (my favourite atm is debian -- you install lynx (or
links -- can't remember which one), and even if you have told it you
only want the really important questions, it asks you what you want the
homepage set to... and this could be in the middle of a two hour
install...) ... FreeBSD just asked me which X servers I wanted to
compile, but it timed out on half of them, so I'm compiling a bunch of x
servers I don't want, which will take longer than needed... which is
annoying. I wish there was a way of getting all the questions out of the
way at the start... likewise, both FreeBSD and sorcery seem to download
things as they go... so you ask to install a package, so it downloads
and compiles a dependency, then downloads the package and compiles
that... it would be nice if they could just do the downloads in a
sensible order, and have them goin gall the time in the background --
there's nothing stopping you from downloading one package whilst
compiling anohter...

Just a few musings while I wait for compiles...
