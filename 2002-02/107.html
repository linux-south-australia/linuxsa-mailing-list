DHCP, who cares. If I want static I'll use dyndns or dns2go.
Port blocking, hmm, but you've said this is optional. I run gnatbox
firewall with alarms so any server I wish to run is monitored and
alarmed.
If I am stupid enough to run an always on (more later!) broadband link
to the net without some sort of security, then I deserve every cent of
the
invoice presented to me for being an idiot.

Perhaps a bit of clarification about the idle and 18 hour timeout would
be
appreciated though. Why? If I'm on DHCP, not using bandwidth etc how is
that
a problem.

I love the standby dialup! 

So given the above, I'm in!

/stand on soapbox

I have been with Tel$tra for over four years. I have watched, with
envy, the rollouts of broadband choices presented to the real Australia,
ie the eastern seaboard. Up until a few months ago I was content to 
put up with my ADSL connection and pay the (what I consider outrageous)
bucks.
Then the the 3GB cap. That did not affect me (I average ~1GB) but the
fact that I had to sign an 18 month contract which imposed penalties if
my situation changed, offended my principles. They can arbitrarily alter
the contract but I cannot! The final straw came with the increased
charges,
topped of with the cessation of the 'hold account' (allowed me, I was
assured,
to keep my existing email address). It will now cost me close to
$100/month an
increase of ~$20 to maintain the service previously provided. Apparently
no
correspondence will be entered into. This contrasts with the fact that
everywhere
else in the world broadband prices are decreasing! The fact that Tel$tra
has
control of the local loop is disgusting, and I hail Internode's efforts
to
provide some sort of alternative service to Adelaide!

get off soapbox, run away/
