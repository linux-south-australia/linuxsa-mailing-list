&gt;Hi.

&gt;Although I am currently unable to avail myself of this service (near-hills
&gt;location), It occurs to me that it might be worth adding a teensy weensy
&gt;more configurability on the optional firewall by allowing the user to
&gt;select which ports are in and which are out. For instance, it might be
&gt;desirable to allow mail, but deny the rest.
&gt;
&gt;If this is already an option please say so, I haven't read the pdf's and I
&gt;haven't seen this mentioned.

Its occurred to us. What I'd say is 'not in version 1', but we may 
well do that down the track. Its been the subject of some design 
discussion internally already. It puts different loads on our systems 
(one global ACL, switched in or out on a per customer basis is a lot 
different in terms of broadband concentrator load than a completely 
user specified ACL per connected user).

But its in the melting pot, yes.

&gt;How about wireless? I think I may have line of sight..
&gt;

You just might.

We have just installed a broadband microwave link that hops from 
Adelaide via Mt Lofty to Murray Bridge.

We've been considering putting some point-to-multipoint radios 
systems on the tower that point over the back of the Adelaide hills, 
if it looks like there would be enough customers there to justify it.

Those systems actually outperform ADSL hugely, at about $2k install 
and a running cost that's essentially the same as 1.5 Mb/s ADSL.

Can you see the channel 2 tower (northern-most TV tower on Mt Lofty)? 
That's the one we're on.

Cheers,
Simon
