I've just spoken to Optus about changing over my Local and Long distance
calls to them and have been advised that the time frame if I lodge my
application today is approximately

Apparently they are flat out with people changing to them ;-) and time
frames are being blown out

7-14 Working days to change Long distance carrier
28 days to change over Local calls

This is going to cause a problem as I don't want to be paying T$ the extra
cash for not being Telstra preselected, but then by the sounds of it, I'm
going to get 2 disconnection periods. The first when I drop Telstra and sign
up with Internode then a second when Telstra finally release me from the
shackles and then let me go to Telstra.

&gt; Subject: Re: Internode Personal ADSL

&gt;
&gt; A note to anyone doing this:  Make sure you change local
&gt; carriers BEFORE
&gt; you change ADSL providers.
&gt;
&gt; The reason is that when you change phone providers, Telstra's
&gt; fscked-up
&gt; billing system treats this as a disconnection, followed by an
&gt; immediate
&gt; reconnection through your new provider.
&gt;
&gt; Part of the automated stuff which happens during a disconnection is
&gt; that your ADSL service is torn-down.  The cancellation results in an
&gt; order being raised to their provisioning team to have a cable guy
&gt; nip down to the exchange to physically un-jumper your line from the
&gt; ADSL C-Mux.
&gt;
&gt; The reconnection which occurs several seconds later doesn't result in
&gt; your ADSL service being lit-up again.  So the request to have
&gt; your line
&gt; unjumpered doesn't get cancelled.
&gt;
&gt; They don't tell ADSL ISP's that they've done this until their next
&gt; bill arrives at the end of the month (when we see the billing mess
&gt; resulting from the cancellations), so we have absolutely no way
&gt; whatsoever of finding out that your ADSL service has stopped working
&gt; until you've complained to us about it.  And, by the time that has
&gt; happened, your line will have been unjumpered.
&gt;
&gt; If your exchange area has a lot of people waiting for ADSL
&gt; installations,
&gt; it's quite likely that your C-Mux port will have been assigned to
&gt; someone else as well.
&gt;
&gt; The stupidest bit of the whole saga is that if Telstra has asked one
&gt; of their people to unjumper your line, but that person hasn't
&gt; confirmed
&gt; that they've finished the job, their provisioning system still thinks
&gt; you have ADSL enabled on your line.  Which means that if we
&gt; submit another
&gt; order to fix up the mess, they will *REJECT* it because you
&gt; already have
&gt; ADSL.  Even though it isn't working and they're in the process of a
&gt; physical disconnection which they're going to have to reverse
&gt; immediately
&gt; afterwards.
&gt;
&gt; The moral of this story is that regardless of which ADSL
&gt; provider you're
&gt; using, you cannot change local phone providers without losing
&gt; your ADSL
&gt; service.  So, if you decide that you want to switch local
&gt; phone carriers,
&gt; do it *at the same time* as your ADSL provider change (because that's
&gt; going to interrupt your ADSL service anyway, so you might as
&gt; well do both
&gt; interruptions at the same time).
&gt;
&gt; For very much the same reason, we can't switch someone from one of the
&gt; current business plans to one of the new residential plans without
&gt; interrupting the customer's service.  We'd love it if we
&gt; could do that,
&gt; but unfortunately the wholesale service the residential plans are
&gt; implemented over is different from the one the business plans use
&gt; (FlexStream for the business plans, the new ACCC-mandated
&gt; PPTP offering
&gt; for the residential ones), and the only way Telstra's provisioning
&gt; system can cope with the change is to disconnect then
&gt; reconnect migrating
&gt; services.  So people switching from one to the other will
&gt; probably lose
&gt; service for a couple of days during the migration period.
