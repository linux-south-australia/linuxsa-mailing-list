I do see your point, but people said similar things about electricity and
railway splits and privatisation, both here and abroad.

I'm not saying splitting up monopolies is a bad thing, and i'm not saying
privatisation is a bad thing, but I am making the point that there are wins
and loses, and historically there seem to be more loses than wins.

&gt; &gt; A problem with breaking up one company into several is thus:
&gt; &gt; Multiple privatised companies all try to make a profit. The cumalative
&gt; &gt; profit margin at the end of the line has, in practice, often been higher
&gt; &gt; than before the company was split up.
&gt;
&gt; But the increase in profit isn't necessarily at the expense of existing
&gt; customers.  Often it's due to the size of the market increasing.  An example
&gt; is that interstate bandwidth in Australia is very expensive as Telstra (as
&gt; an example) do not see value in selling excess capacity on their fibre as
&gt; they see it'll take away from their data carriage business.
&gt;
&gt; If Telstra is broken up in the manner I discussed earlier, then that
&gt; component of Telstra is going to be looking for revenue, and thus should
&gt; allow more access to the interstate capacity at a lower cost, hence
&gt; (through the magic of S&D) more people will participate in the market as the
&gt; cost and availablity will improve. (eg. Internode may run their own SDH
&gt; links to Vic/NSW/QLD to allow access to SXC etc).
&gt;
&gt; This means that the profit of that component of Telstra may increase (as the
&gt; extra capacity costs them nothing except Opportunity cost).  The other
&gt; components of the broken up Telstra may experience a decrease in profits
&gt; initially, but as their prices drop the number of people wanting to buy
&gt; affordable interstate data carriage will increase and their profit will rise
&gt; again.
&gt;
&gt; This example is obviously a little simplistic but you, hopefully, see my
&gt; point.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does privatizing Telstra have to do with it?  Personally I think
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that'd be one of the /worst/ outcomes:  At least they currently have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to put up the pretense of community service;  The only motive they'd
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have if they were 100% privately owned would be profit.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /Then/ you'd see their monopolistic tendencies come to the fore...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; However, at the moment you have a big problem and that is the Government has
&gt; &gt; &gt; two rolls: one as owner of Telstra second as regulator.  Because they have
&gt; &gt; &gt; conflicting rolls we end up that because they want to sell Telstra soon
&gt; &gt; &gt; they're happy to allow Telstra to run up big profits at the moment (jacking
&gt; &gt; &gt; up prices, reducing spending) to get the best price for it later.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; At least if they sold it off they'd be happier to regulate it more closely.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not that ultimately I think that'd work either, I think they need to divide
&gt; &gt; &gt; Telstra into separate companies - eg. longhaul (interstate), local (eg. last
&gt; &gt; &gt; mile copper, local loop etc) and services (internet, switching, etc) - this
&gt; &gt; &gt; would allow companies to buy services more easily from Telstra where it has
&gt; &gt; &gt; a true monopoly (local loop) and compete more sucessfully in others (eg.
&gt; &gt; &gt; internet).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; However, we get back to the problem that the Govt is the owner and wants to
&gt; &gt; &gt; maximise sale price and so won't break it up because it'd reduce the sell
&gt; &gt; &gt; price.
