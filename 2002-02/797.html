Hi all

It's _very_ easy to misinterpret a persons meaning when reading email. The 
use of (-: 's and &lt;grins&gt; has lightened the meaning greatly. I thought 
"lurling" was funny, we don't always have to 'assume', you know the meaning 
of assume "it makes an ass of u and me", the negative. So read postings with 
ones tongue firmly planted in ones cheek.

&gt;
&gt; I agree - without wanting to be too pedantic, there's really no need to
&gt; publically pick apart someone's language skills unless they're that poor
&gt; that they totally obscure the meaning of the message the person is trying
&gt; to convey.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;If a user post to this list in HTML then they probably aren't
&gt; &gt;aware of the accepted practices here, they may also not know
&gt; &gt;how to turn of HTML in there client, it may also be fair to
&gt; &gt;assume that some one who needed guidance at that level also
&gt; &gt;might not know that the archives exist let alone how to search
&gt; &gt;them.
&gt; &gt;I beleive it doesn't hurt to be nice even to an newbie.
&gt;
&gt; OK, here starts the pedantry :)
&gt;
&gt; There's not necessarily a correlation between being a Linux Newbie and
&gt; having a lack of technical aptitude.
&gt;
&gt; In fact, in my limited experience the people who choose to use Linux aren't
&gt; usually complete turnips at all - for one thing, they will have usually
&gt; already assessed Windoze and decided that it doesn't meet their needs. 
&gt; This is based on the pretense that most new retail PC's are sold with
&gt; Windoze preinstalled, excepting those which are set up for other people by
&gt; real Linux enthusiasts.  However it takes a certain amount of savvy to
&gt; successfully make one's way through a Linux install (although decreasingly
&gt; so as improvements happen, so prepare for greater numbers of turnips to
&gt; jump ship...), so I'd venture a guess that if they're intelligent enough to
&gt; do that then they can certainly search a website archive.
&gt;
&gt; The mailing list info page states "HTML posts may be ignored and are
&gt; usually not well accepted." (and then contradicts itself further down the
&gt; page), so there's no definitive statement that says "Thou shalt not post
&gt; HTML"...  If it's that disagreeable, either insist that the list
&gt; moderator/administrator filter out HTML mailings, or go join a list which
&gt; does.
&gt;
&gt; OK, that's enough out of me.
&gt;
&gt; I just wanted to see my name in print anyway...
&gt;
&gt; Jason =)
