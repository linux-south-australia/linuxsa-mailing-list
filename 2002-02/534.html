&gt; According to whirlpool.net.au's FAQ, that makes you a low ping bastard 
&gt; (LPB).  I'm *so* glad ADSL is coming to my exchange soon.

Only way to play :)

&gt; The overseas pings don't look very fast, but I guess they're better than 
&gt; most dialups.

I'm on Telstra BigPond Direct, and the overseas link has been rather poor
for the last two weeks or so. However, even when it's good, the latency is
still 200+ for me. The recent overseas slowdown seems to be at the US end, so
it's probably not Telstra's fault.

When I was working at SE-Net, back when they had a 100 MBit Connect and a 10
MBit UUNet link, the overseas pings were still 200+. Download rates varied
considerably, but were usually above the 50 kilobyte/sec range.

&gt; Do ADSL users find that their latency is much lower?
To local game servers, yes. To overseas ones, sometimes. Download speeds are
universally much quicker, unless there's a bottleneck somewhere at their end.

For instance, KeenSpot (host of many online comics) is always very slow, but
I expect that it's very slow to our US cousins, as well.

PlanetMirror and mirror.aarnet are _much_ quicker than over dialup :)
