A note to anyone doing this:  Make sure you change local carriers BEFORE
you change ADSL providers.

The reason is that when you change phone providers, Telstra's fscked-up
billing system treats this as a disconnection, followed by an immediate
reconnection through your new provider.

Part of the automated stuff which happens during a disconnection is
that your ADSL service is torn-down.  The cancellation results in an
order being raised to their provisioning team to have a cable guy 
nip down to the exchange to physically un-jumper your line from the
ADSL C-Mux.

The reconnection which occurs several seconds later doesn't result in
your ADSL service being lit-up again.  So the request to have your line
unjumpered doesn't get cancelled.

They don't tell ADSL ISP's that they've done this until their next
bill arrives at the end of the month (when we see the billing mess 
resulting from the cancellations), so we have absolutely no way 
whatsoever of finding out that your ADSL service has stopped working
until you've complained to us about it.  And, by the time that has
happened, your line will have been unjumpered.

If your exchange area has a lot of people waiting for ADSL installations,
it's quite likely that your C-Mux port will have been assigned to 
someone else as well.

The stupidest bit of the whole saga is that if Telstra has asked one 
of their people to unjumper your line, but that person hasn't confirmed
that they've finished the job, their provisioning system still thinks
you have ADSL enabled on your line.  Which means that if we submit another
order to fix up the mess, they will *REJECT* it because you already have
ADSL.  Even though it isn't working and they're in the process of a
physical disconnection which they're going to have to reverse immediately
afterwards.

The moral of this story is that regardless of which ADSL provider you're
using, you cannot change local phone providers without losing your ADSL
service.  So, if you decide that you want to switch local phone carriers,
do it *at the same time* as your ADSL provider change (because that's 
going to interrupt your ADSL service anyway, so you might as well do both
interruptions at the same time).

For very much the same reason, we can't switch someone from one of the
current business plans to one of the new residential plans without
interrupting the customer's service.  We'd love it if we could do that,
but unfortunately the wholesale service the residential plans are 
implemented over is different from the one the business plans use
(FlexStream for the business plans, the new ACCC-mandated PPTP offering
for the residential ones), and the only way Telstra's provisioning 
system can cope with the change is to disconnect then reconnect migrating
services.  So people switching from one to the other will probably lose
service for a couple of days during the migration period.
