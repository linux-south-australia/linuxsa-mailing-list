One danger I could see of that, is that it creates a false sense of
security.

ie. The user goes to the "simulated attack" page, and at the end it says
everything was fine.

User then gets taken out by an exploit that hasn't been incorporated into
the security test page yet. Or else some custom job. or something.

User then complains that Internode said the user's firewall was good, and so
user trusted this expert information, but has now lost money (the secret
plans for their perpetual motion generator machine were stolen) due to the
info being wrong. User sues internode for an infinite amount of money.
(After all, those perpetual motion machine plans could generate an infinite
amount of power)

Only applies to lawyer-happy lusers, but Australia is slowly receiving some
infection in that area from America. You try to help people, and they turn
around and sue you..

&gt; &gt;  &gt; Would you consider writing some software that regularily tried to

&gt; &gt;  &gt; findings?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No.  That's illegal.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; and simon said there's no point when the evil internet people do it anyway.  Is it still ilegal if
&gt; it was, say, controlled by a web page which expicity asked permision from the user?
&gt;
&gt; So send an email to the customers and say "Hey, we have a thing which can tell us if your bending
&gt; over for the evil internet people, go &lt;link&gt;here&lt;/link&gt; to check it out.  Then have that page
&gt; describe what will happen, and yes, the firewall is going to go nuts.
&gt;
&gt; I guess there are already places that do this kind of thing, but if it were incorperated into the
&gt; ISP *giving* the un-blocked service.... Imagine a web-based config tool which allowed the customer
&gt; to see what there download usage was etc. etc. and also had the ability to switch on of off port
&gt; blocking.  Then the system can say "in order for us to ensure high quality blah blah blah, we are
&gt; going to sweep your link for holes."
