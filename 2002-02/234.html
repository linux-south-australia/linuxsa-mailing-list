Hi,

Well, I got DSL up under Linux in Mountain View last night ...

A co-worker lent me a DSL modem ... and it came up easily under Linux. 
Turns out that the SpeedTouch PC probably would have come up under Linux 
as well, but I had a wireless card in the machine and PCMCIA was not 
beeping when it loaded the wireless driver, so I was not aware, and I 
had told PPPOE to use the eth device that was really wireless and ... :-(

In any case, DSL with PacBell is $49.95 a month for 1.5Mb/s down and 
128kb/s up, no fixed IP.

For $69.95 a month you can have 5 fixed IPs and it increases to 384kb/s up.

If you sign up for 12 months, you get the modem for free, otherwise they 
charge you $99 for the modem.

These charges seem comparible to the Oz scene, which I find incredible 
[1], except that there are no download caps [2]. There are also cheaper 
suppliers around [3].

The amusing event that happened was that I called PacBell tech support 
about my Linux issue. The nice person on the other end was unable to 
help me and pointed the Linux was outside their support guarantee, but 
gave me the Linux 1-800 number. When I rang that number, it turned out 
to be LinkSys tech support :-)

[1] The Oz prices are very keen given that the Telstra and Optus charges 
are such a large proportion of the costs to ISPs.

[2] Some ISPs, it seems, will do bandwidth limiting if they determine 
that you are using too much.

[3] It is pretty clear that PacBell is going to be around for a long 
time. Many of the cheaper suppliers are using Covad, and it is not clear 
how long they will be around.
