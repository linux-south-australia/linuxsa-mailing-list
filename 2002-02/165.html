 &gt; &gt;If they're not following it to the letter, you take it up with Telstra
 &gt; &gt;first (if you don't get any joy from the person you talk to, ask to
 &gt; &gt;talk to their superior, and keep going until they won't let you talk 
 &gt; &gt;to any other superiors).  If you fail to do that before you go to the
 &gt; &gt;TIO, the TIO's answer will be, "Customer has not given Telstra the 
 &gt; &gt;opportunity to settle the issue internally, therefore there is not yet
 &gt; &gt;any cause for adjudication."
 &gt; 
 &gt; It seems Telstra drones adopt the "He / She isnt really serious" then
 &gt; they adopt the "Supervisor isn't available" after 5 minutes on hold etc
 &gt; etc. If I make a request to talk to a supervisor and am told nobody is
 &gt; available it surely shouldn't be up to me to jump through their hoops
 &gt; until they get their act together.

You're correct - if you ask to talk to a superior and they refuse,
that's when you hang up the phone with no further discussion and go
straight to the TIO.

But as long as they're prepared to continue to negotiate, you have
no case with the TIO.  You're not up to the "last" resort yet.

 &gt; I think the main argument is - Telstra construct terms and conditions
 &gt; which basically say "We may not screw you now, but if we want to in
 &gt; three months time, we will... And you'll enjoy it.
 
Yup - And people go and sign those contracts.  

 &gt; I think that really what everyone's beef is, is this - Telstra basically
 &gt; put terms and conditions into contracts which in all truth have no place
 &gt; in a contract, we have all the responsibility - they have none.

So don't accept the contract.  Telstra /does/ have competitors, you know.
Go with someone else who has a more trustworthy track-record.

Ever since competition was introduced into the telecommunications 
industry, Telstra have consistently shown themselves to be the 
least trustworthy carrier, with the highest prices, and the worst
customer service.  So why do people keep using them?  Beats me!  It's
not like you don't have an alternative, after all.

With each passing year, there are fewer and fewer things which 
telco customers /need/ Telstra to do.  Indeed, for residential
customers, there's probably /nothing/ which needs Telstra anymore.

In the wholesale space things are still a bit different, but with
the exception of the local loop pretty much everything is contestable.

So vote with your feet:  Every time you have an opportunity to take
up a contestable service, pick a non-Telstra alternative.  You need
to question whether they deserve your business, since there are 
dozens of alternative providers out there who would dearly love to
show you how much better than Telstra they can be.

The thing to remember here is that nobody is holding a gun to your 
head and forcing you to sign a contract with someone who will 
fsck you over.  You're entering into these agreements voluntarily,
so it's hard to get upset about mistreatment afterwards.
