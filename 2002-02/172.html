Hi.

well, we're on the hills face at Mt Osmond. I don't think I can see the TV
towers, Mt Osmond blocks us, but we have pretty good city views (excellent
from the roof)

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt;Hi.

&gt; &gt;Although I am currently unable to avail myself of this service (near-hills
&gt; &gt;location), It occurs to me that it might be worth adding a teensy weensy
&gt; &gt;more configurability on the optional firewall by allowing the user to
&gt; &gt;select which ports are in and which are out. For instance, it might be
&gt; &gt;desirable to allow mail, but deny the rest.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If this is already an option please say so, I haven't read the pdf's and I
&gt; &gt;haven't seen this mentioned.
&gt; 
&gt; Its occurred to us. What I'd say is 'not in version 1', but we may 
&gt; well do that down the track. Its been the subject of some design 
&gt; discussion internally already. It puts different loads on our systems 
&gt; (one global ACL, switched in or out on a per customer basis is a lot 
&gt; different in terms of broadband concentrator load than a completely 
&gt; user specified ACL per connected user).
&gt; 
&gt; But its in the melting pot, yes.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;How about wireless? I think I may have line of sight..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; You just might.
&gt; 
&gt; We have just installed a broadband microwave link that hops from 
&gt; Adelaide via Mt Lofty to Murray Bridge.
&gt; 
&gt; We've been considering putting some point-to-multipoint radios 
&gt; systems on the tower that point over the back of the Adelaide hills, 
&gt; if it looks like there would be enough customers there to justify it.
&gt; 
&gt; Those systems actually outperform ADSL hugely, at about $2k install 
&gt; and a running cost that's essentially the same as 1.5 Mb/s ADSL.
&gt; 
&gt; Can you see the channel 2 tower (northern-most TV tower on Mt Lofty)? 
&gt; That's the one we're on.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Simon
