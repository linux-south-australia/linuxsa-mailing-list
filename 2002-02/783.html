I also lurk on this list, hoping to learn some thing new, 
But most of what I pick up here seems to be negative attitude.
So I figured I'd add my own grips in the hope that if some one doesn't want
to put in a positive contribution, and just criticises peoples spelling,
grammar and obvious typos that they might refrain from harsh judgement,
look at the content and respond to the meaning of a post.

NOTE: TO DSL
         If a user post to this list in HTML then they probably aren't
aware of the accepted practices here, they may also not know how to turn of
HTML in there client, it may also be fair to assume that some one who
needed guidance at that level also might not know that the archives exist
let alone how to search them.

I beleive it doesn't hurt to be nice even to an newbie.

cheers

&gt; I don't often have much to say and usually just lurl so here goes.

You lurl eh?

&gt; It is my experience that the average punter has difficulty setting up
&gt; their own email and internet connections let alone installing and
&gt; configuring an operating system let alone fixing things that may go
&gt; wrong along the way. I can not believe how many calls I get from friends
&gt; and aquaintances asking for help with computer problems.

Yes I know; my friends call me about Windows problems and I still manage
to fix them. But the fact they are computer illiterate bears no
statistical relation to the operating systm.

&gt; On one hand we have Windows which has a very easy installer and in most
&gt; cases works straight out of the box. On the other hand there is Linux,
&gt; and depending which flavour you have, requires a lot of preparation in
&gt; the form of reading to ensure it works after install.

To take a leaft out of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire", one should ask a
friend and work out which Linux works straight out of the box.
 
&gt; Once Windows is installed generally this is where the average punter
&gt; will start to have problems, as most people do not want to dedicate too
&gt; much time to learning how to manage and maintain there PC.

If you substitute Windows with Linux, Mac OS Classic, Amiga OS or DOS
your paragraph still holds water.

&gt; Linux on the other hand requires far more effort and reading to get it
&gt; set up, and in most "newbie" cases they give up before reaching a stage
&gt; where they can cast off their previous operating systems and reap the
&gt; long term rewards of their stable operating system.

If you substitute Windows with Linux, Mac OS Classic, Amiga OS or DOS
your paragraph still holds water. Naturally there are differences in the
OS'es, I'm considering what you said a null hypothesis and seeing
whether it holds water. I don't think it does.

&gt; This is where the difference will be made. The long term survival and
&gt; proliferation of the Linux environment will depend on either the system
&gt; becoming extremely easy to install, setup and use or there is a much
&gt; more proactive and upbeat help system for newbies from within the
&gt; experienced community using Linux.

Well, it is becoming extremely easy to install, setup and use. I started
at RedHat 5.2 and I've noticed the differences on the way. And I've
given people a huge amount of time actually helping them when I can (and
having amusement at their expense when I can't -- lol).

&gt; An observation, when I first posted to a Linux list I used Outlook
&gt; Express (HTML) I received many emails that told me that HTML was not
&gt; liked by the Linux community and not one of those emails offered me any
&gt; assistance with my particular problem. This nearly blew me away.
&gt; Fortunately I am not discouraged so easily.

Oh please.

If you went to the festival theatre and misbehaved yourself, the
festival theatre wouldn't give you training on how to behave. They'd
just eject you from the premises. Some people, like myself, think that
it's character building for poor widdle Outlook [Express] users to work
out how to turn off HTML e-mail. Other people (like Greg Lehey) have
written a nice little web-page (whose URL I always forget -- look THOSE
words up with Lehey and you'll find it in the archives) to tell the
Outlook users what to do.

It shouldn't have blown you away -- the Linux community tends not to be
altogether supportive of Outlook or Outlook Express. I just can't think
of a reason why. Really.

&gt; I apologise for the lengthy post.

Don't apologise for lengthy posts; the less the lurlers (lmao) lurl, the
safer we all are from lurling...
