If you flip this issue around on itself, you'll see why I think that 
the -option- of firewalling the connection will be very popular for 
less educated and worldly-wise people than your good self.

The piece I missed initially was making it optional. We've fixed that 
in response to a number of very sensible pieces of feedback on the 
matter from this list.

For those who elect to use the filter when we provide it, we'll be 
using it to protect those less educated users than you from all sorts 
of things they don't want to know about and won't appreciate (being 
broken into; getting a huge unexpected bill).

Customers who use our filtering won't be charged for packets we block.

&gt;Perhaps a bit of clarification about the idle and 18 hour timeout would
&gt;be
&gt;appreciated though. Why? If I'm on DHCP, not using bandwidth etc how is
&gt;that
&gt;a problem.

Its really more about being up front with our rotation rate, unlike 
other ADSL providers who don't even disclose how long they'll hold an 
address up for.

Since you're obviously savvy on dynamic dns frobs etc, you will 
obviously just set up a script to reconnect/reconfigure things when 
needed, so you're not going to even notice the 18 hour rotation of IP 
address.

These things are partially there to protect less educated people than 
you, for whom its far safer to have their computer disconnect from 
the 'net if they go on holiday for a week and leave their computer 
on, than it is to leave it online indefinitely.

Remember we're trying to cater to a community far wider than just LinuxSA here.

[...]

&gt;I love the standby dialup!
&gt;
&gt;So given the above, I'm in!
&gt;

Thank you!

Simon
