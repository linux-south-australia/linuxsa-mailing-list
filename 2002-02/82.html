&gt; I set up raid on my local server and all seemd to go well with no

I can't advise, merely tell you what we've done.  Now that disks
are cheap we RAID-1 or RAID-5 everything.

I recently configured software RAID-1 over two IDE drives.  These
drives were the boot and root partition and boot device.

During testing I found the following:

  - the HOWTO lists issues that have subsequently been solved, setting
    up a software RAID boot partition is now done exactly the same
    as setting up any other partition.

  - LILO recognises the RAID and writes to the MBR of both drives.

  - the BIOS will only boot from one of the first two IDE drives.

  - be careful how you configure the BIOS, our's had a "fast boot"
    option that didn't scan for new drives.  So when a drive failed
    it didn't take it out of the list of bootable drives and boot
    from the next hard disk.

  - The BIOS viewed the CDROM as a drive, so the IDE cabling matters
    (arrrgh!).  The disks have to be found first.  The cabling that
     worked for us was:

                   Controller    IDE0
                   |
                   Slave
                   |
                   Master        Disk 1 (jumpered to master with no slave)

                   Controller    IDE1
                   |
                   Slave         CD-ROM (jumpered to slave)
                   |
                   Master        Disk 2 (jumpered to master with slave)

     From which we guessed that this BIOS scans the drives in the order
     IDE0 Master, IDE0 Slave, IDE1 Master, IDE1 Slave.

     It's not clear if the CD-ROM works if Disk 2 fails to come up on
     the IDE bus.  This would be a rare failure mode for the disk.

  - We had to update the CD-ROM to a model that used the same PIO mode
    as the disks to get maximum performance.  If you can, do without a
    CD-ROM drive or use a third IDE controller.

  - You need an initrd.  It contains the kernel modules for software RAID.

Some of the above shows clearly why SCSI is the better disk bus.

&gt; Would it be as simple as adding a drive and installing the OS with the
&gt; same partions for the raid, updating the raidtab and running raidhotadd
&gt; 'path'?

If the machine keeps trying to boot from the corrupted half of
the mirror, then I'd boot from boot floppy, raidhotremove and
swapoff the corrupted half, and reboot ejecting the floppy.

If the disk fails completely the BIOS should automatically
boot from the second drive.

&gt; Finally Redhat let me setup /boot as an RAID but when using the command
&gt; to recover a simulated failure it tells me the disk is too small why 
&gt; during
&gt; install and not for recovery?

I don't understand this at all, what tells you the disk is too
small?

Our partitioning on both disks is

    Device Boot     Blocks   Id  System                  Mounted as
/dev/hda1   *      307408+  fd  Linux raid autodetect     /boot
/dev/hda2         5120136   fd  Linux raid autodetect     /tmp and others
/dev/hda3         1024128   82  Linux swap
/dev/hda4        91234080    f  Win95 Ext'd (LBA)
/dev/hda5        91234048+  fd  Linux raid autodetect     /

/boot is 250MB simply because the disk is so big at 100GB.  Now we
don't have to repartition when upgrading to RHL13.0 :-)

The swap partition is 1GB because the maximum memory this motherboard
takes is 3 128MB cards.  Double that for the recommended swap.  Rounding
up that's about 1GB.  In normal operation there is 2GB of swap (it's
software RAID so the operating system sees two swap partitions).  Remember
to use swapoff and to update the swap entries in /etc/fstab when
using raidhotremove or updating /etc/raidtab.

We made sure /boot was in a primary partition.  Not sure if this
was necessary but seemed a wise precaution.  We made /boot a
seperate parition, although this was not strictly necessary
for our BIOS.  This allows a drive to be booted on another
machine should that be needed for some fix or another.

/tmp, /var/tmp, /var/log, /var/spool are in a seperate
partition to increase machine stability.  This probably
lowers performance.  It is important to be to use relative
symlinks when sending multiple directories into one
partition.

Regards,
Glen
