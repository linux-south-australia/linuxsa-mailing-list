Re Using Unix/Linux : I've got no idea how they do it but a Data recovery
Service in Adelaide does exactly that( or so I am led to believe. They take
a hard drive..hook it up to the Unix box and allegedly run some software
they developed themselves to recover the data.

I'm not endorsing them in any way but fyi :

&gt; Subject: Hard Drive recovery
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; One of my friends recently had his 20 GB hdd corrupted when
&gt; hot swapping
&gt; it in a rack. The drive appears to have a mixture of files
&gt; from his hdd
&gt; and the one that was in the rack before his. All the files appear to
&gt; have
&gt; been corrupted. Some have readable names, most have been changed to a
&gt; mixture of random ascii characters. We have tried using
&gt; sector scanning
&gt; drive recovery software but it has not worked.
&gt;
&gt; A friend of his told him that this was as a result of the computer
&gt; (somehow)
&gt; overwriting the FAT (which is FAT32) on his drive with the
&gt; one belonging
&gt; to
&gt; the other drive (which was no longer plugged in). Is this possible?
&gt; (Win XP was being used during the hot swap) He also told my
&gt; friend that
&gt; the best chance of retrieving the data was by using a Linux
&gt; box to mount
&gt; the drive and to try copying the files off from there, but didn't give
&gt; any
&gt; details of how to do so.
&gt;
&gt; 1)
&gt;  Since the FAT has been corrupted won't Linux display the same results
&gt; as XP?
&gt;
&gt; 2)
&gt;  Is there any possible way of recovering the data on the drive with
&gt; Linux?
&gt;
&gt; 3)
&gt;  Does anyone know of a program for Linux or Windows (pref one
&gt; for each)
&gt; that reads
&gt;  the physical surface of the hdd in Hex/Ascii or allows bin/hex/ascii
&gt; editing
&gt;  of the drive surface itself.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I don't ask for much do I :P
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Nathan Millhouse

&gt;
&gt; ***Thankyou in advance to everyone who replies to this mail.
&gt;
&gt; Although I don't post or answer questions much (I leave that
&gt; part to the
&gt; more qualified :) )
&gt; I have learnt a huge amount of valuable knowledge by reading
&gt; the posts
&gt; on this list over the 3 1/2 years. This list performs a great service
&gt; to those in need, Thankyou once again.
