&gt; I'm currently trying to install Debian 2.2r2 (from the two CD's provided
&gt; with APC's Advanced Linux Pocketbook), and having a few problems with my
&gt; network card.
&gt; 
&gt; My network card is a Netgear FA311 PCI Network card, using the natsemi
&gt; module.  Unfortunately, this is not included in the Debian install.

I had the same problem, and thought it was too much hassle to get it 
working.  (I didn't have the CD, and wanted to do an ftp install.)

I bought the FA311 because I was mistakenly told it was based on the DEC 
Tulip chipset, which has very good cross-platform support, including 
Linux 2.2.

Unfortunately the next Debian release's (woody's) installer, won't 
support this card natively either.  On the upside, I think someone's 
working on a new version of the "boot-floppies" installer based on the 
Linux 2.4 kernel.  Maybe have a look on a Debian mirror in the same 
place you find the other custom floppies (ide-pci, compact, and so on).

&gt; have managed to locate Linux drivers from the Netgear site, which
&gt; includes files "makefile", "natsemi.o", "natsemi.c").  Running "make"
&gt; doesn't seem to compile anything, and I'm wondering how exactly I can
&gt; get it going in the kernel installed...?

 From memory those drivers were designed for Linux 2.0, but the Debian 
installer uses Linux 2.2.  If they are indeed for Linux 2.2, please send 
me the URL.

Could it be that the object (.o) file can just be loaded as a kernel 
module with something like insmod or modprobe?

&gt; Also, I have an Intellimouse Explorer connected using USB... Modules
&gt; used under Redhat 7.2 were usb-uhci, and hid.  I had installed these in
&gt; Debian, however, I couldn't seem to get the mouse going in XF86Setup...
&gt; Does anyone know any tricks to getting this going?

Another thing I wouldn't bother with, but you could do, is to get it 
working in a mouse daemon like gpm, then configure XFree86 to use gpm.

Equally, there *may* be a set of Debian boot floppies that support USB, 
but you won't need mouse support during the installer anyhow.  Just have 
a look for a Debian USB support FAQ, as stuff like that's pretty easy to 
get running once you have a base system installed.

I hope something I said here helps! :-)
