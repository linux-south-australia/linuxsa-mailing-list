Tech question on redhat 7.2 NFS problem

I have setup a class network with 20 student machines on one subnet and the 
admin machines on the other. DNS is fine, DHCP is fine and all in all things are 
as expected, except, NFS.  NFS works fine with normal connection say, one at a 
time by users, however, after making kickstart disks, to do auto rebuilds after 
students trash the machines, I find that only 4 machines at ant time can be 
built.  If I try on &gt;4 machines I get a range of errors.

1 - frame size too large
2 - unable to create /tmp/ks.cfg
3 -and freeze ups with random ascii garbage

I can see all of these errors with the alt keys during boot.  This did not happen 
with redhat 7.1 we could easily build 20 machines (allbeit slowly).

After building the systems tonight, I have not really tried to find a solution, 
but I will tomorrow.  I don't want to preempt any suggestions re why this is 
happening, as I will have a good debug session tomorrow. so I would welcome 
any suggestions to help me overcome this one.  My fist thoughts were on the 
kernel (standard 7.2) but that was probably tiredness.

I'll be on it tomorrow so could you please cc to <A HREF="mailto:sdonalds@adel.tafe.sa.edu.au">sdonalds@adel.tafe.sa.edu.au</A> 
and I can try some of you suggestions.

Hmm wonder if FTP would be a temporary solution??

Thanx all

Steve D
