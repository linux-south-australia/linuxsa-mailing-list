&gt; It's really only continual writing that presents a threat, but equally it

&gt; In an embedded application I'd think about partitioning the 'disk' into
&gt; two, having a read-only root partition and a R/W partition mounted on
&gt; /data or somewhere else where I can explicitly control writes; and having
&gt; a RAM fs for /var/log /tmp /usr/tmp and so on.

I did a similar thing in a previous job except it was using solaris x86
and a compact flash card.  I stuck with ufs with the OS mounted read-only
with /var and bits of /usr (in other words the parts solaris writes to
during normal running) symlinked to under /tmp which in solaris is memory
(ie. equivalent of a ram disk in linux).  

This meant no messages file etc was kept on a reboot or failure but that 
didn't matter in this application.  The logs and data that were important 
were written to a partition of the flash directly by the application 
(ie. read()/write() to the disk device (eg. /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s4)).

I started out wanting to use linux but it wasn't possible due to drivers for
third party hardware not being available for linux.  A dos filesystem was also
considered but seemed not possible/too hard in solaris (should be possible
in linux though).

PS. we also had problems writing too much too quickly to the flash, for some
reason I don't understand it seemed slower than disk (even though there's no
moving parts), I had to do a kind of buffered write scheme to cut down on the 
writes to the flash.
