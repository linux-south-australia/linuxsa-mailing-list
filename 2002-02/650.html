&gt;&gt;  Hi,
&gt;&gt;Can some one point me in the right direction please.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The Problem
&gt;&gt;I am using Mandrake 8.1 which uses rpmdrake to manage software installation
&gt;&gt;I have updated Mozilla using the online package installation from their 
&gt;&gt;site to install v0.9.8
&gt;&gt;before which I removed the Mozilla rpms installed and the associated 
&gt;&gt;packages which rely on it.
&gt;&gt;Now of these packages I only really wanted to replace Galeon for which I 
&gt;&gt;downloaded the latest RPM 1.0.3.2.
&gt;&gt;However, it stalls on installation requiring Mozilla 0.9.8 as a 
&gt;&gt;dependancy before installation can continue.
&gt;&gt;The latest rpm I can find of Mozilla is v0.9.4.4
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My Question
&gt;&gt;Is there a way to tell the rpm system about tgz installed programs?
&gt;&gt;Ive noticed this before, but as the tgz's and rpm's were independant I 
&gt;&gt;just kept note of the programs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Simple Answer: No.
&gt;
Mmm! that's about where I got to.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Complex Answer: You could futz around with the RPM database but I
&gt;wouldn't want to do it.
&gt;
I agree I looked there and there's way more info required than I know 
how to aquire at this point. (But I might still tinker)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The best bet is to stay with the RPMs for your distro.
&gt;
Where's the fun in that?  

&gt;  Do you really
&gt;eed the bleeding edge? 
&gt;
That's my decision, isn't what home systems are for. BFI actually I am 
looking for some of the features in the later versions of mozilla messenger
(Handles multi account pop and imap with individual setting for 
recipients to recieve html/txt and renders html mail consistantly.  )
I guess I could have left the old mozilla / galeon setup seperate and 
intact. But then I would have a redundant version of mozilla available 
just for galeon to run.
(I dislike carrying redundancies).
 

&gt; If so, Red Hat has "rawhide" RPMS,
&gt;
Mmmm! I hadn't looked here.

&gt; which are
&gt;pretty much the latest and greatest, but haven't been tested to work
&gt;with everything else, so you can have the latest and greatest if you are
&gt;willing to risk some instability.  Under Manduck I'm not so sure.  You
&gt;could try their Manduck Users Club so whatever it's called - someone may
&gt;have built new RPMs for some newer versions of software.
&gt;
Mmmm! not that I could find, is there a way to convert tgz to rpms?
Do I need source code tgz to do this?
Ive read a little on this under rpms but can't see a clear answer.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The other hackish way is to reinstall your old Mozilla via RPMS so the
&gt;database is updated, and then remove the mozilla files (rpm -ql mozilla)
&gt;and insall your tgz.  Or install both mozilla and galeon from tgz and
&gt;not from RPM at all.
&gt;
Yuk, that kept me offline for a while. The Database still records 
version wrong and even using  the force option for galeon left me with 
both programs broken. Tried changing the Database version info for 
mozilla before reinstalling galeon and still broke something, I think I 
traced it to being the differences in some of the lib files but backed 
out as it was getting a little too involved.
 Removed the lot and went back to where I started.

&gt;But don't do it.  Install a Galeon RPM that matches your Mozilla RPM. 
&gt;You won't have the latest of everything, but it'll all work.
&gt;
Now I've done it, the old galeon is now asking for the mozilla 0.9.8, I 
didn't check this before the first posting. According to the rpmdrake 
(Software installer) I have mozilla 0.9.4.4 installed.

Thanks
David Delyn
