&gt; Hi there all,
&gt; I was wondering if some one could point me in the right direction.
&gt; I have this private project of my own that has been on the back burners
&gt; for the last 8 years, The problems I have had up to date is what
&gt; language to use / learn.
&gt; The project consits of a GPS to obtain locational data and a series of
&gt; maps that are obtainable 9 cd's for south australia basically needs to
&gt; 'move the map' image which are tiffs using rs232 data in a standard nema
&gt; format.
&gt; There are other things I wouls like to do but this is the bare bones,
&gt; yes and change maps automatically.
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds like a lot of work but I have no idea what would be the best
&gt; langauge to use, yes I would like to program under linux, pooie to
&gt; windzose I allready have a program that I have bought and works very
&gt; well but it requires a fast machine.
&gt; 
&gt; I have already invested over $1000 in maps only for S.A. and I would
&gt; like to see them used on a daily bases on a brick pc that I have with a
&gt; lcd 10.4".
&gt; 
&gt; Some one please HELP...
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers Paul Mullins
