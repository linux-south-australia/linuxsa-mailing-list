Hi all -- I was wondering what do people think about the recent (last 6
months, perhaps) rash of messages regarding ISPs recently... Personally,
I think they tend to border on commercial postings, and as such, maybe
should be taken off-list... However, it's definitely a subject that
people are interested in, and is kinda relevant to Linux, particuarly as
we like to download ISOs and so on.

The problem here, in my reckoning, is that there are many ISPs in
Adelaide, ranging in their stance on Linux (and BSD and OSS) from being
on this list, to those who pass you to the MS support line if you
mention "Linx". They also range from crap to really good, slow to fast,
cheap to expensive and so on. I'm sure that even most ISP types would
(perhaps reluctantly) agree with me if I said that this diversity is
good for consumers. However, on this list, we run the risk of becoming
rather non-neutral ground in regards to ISPs.

I consider this to be a bad thing. I don't know if I'm alone here or
not, but I'd like to think that LinuxSA was a safe place to discuss
things relevant (eg ISPs) without too much salesmanship. For eg, we
recently had some discussion on IDE RAID cards, and a few were
mentioned, a few criticised... However, if this were to happen regarding
ISPs, we would immediately have large-scale discussions on the relative
merits of one ISP over another, or why one way of doing is is best or
whatever... (well, maybe we wouldn't, but that's the feeling I get...)

So, what I suggest is that either we invite ISPs across the board to
have a regular speil, or we try to restrict sales-related discussion to
offline only. Of course, there's a lot of technical stuff that's
relevant, but it does border on salesmanship sometimes... also, a number
of ISP types do contribute a lot of technical stuff to the list, but
then, so do people from a large number of other organisations... Other
organisations also occasionally make commercial announcements (I have
been known to do this occasionally), but these are usually one-offs,
informational, and request follow-ups to be taken off-line...

What do people think about this -- is this an issue that bothers more
than just me?
