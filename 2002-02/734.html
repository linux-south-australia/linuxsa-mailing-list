&gt;&gt; Hmm. I was stripping the wires on a phone line one day when I was still
&gt;&gt; young and stupid, using my teeth. The phone must have rung. I can verify
&gt;&gt; that the voltage is a lot higher than a 9volt battery to the toungue! I
&gt;&gt; would guess at least 30 volts.
&gt;
&gt; On hook, it's -48 VDC (that's negative with respect to ground).  Off hook,
&gt; this falls to around -8 VDC or so[1], depending a lot on line characteristics
&gt; and load of the off hook telephone.  A ring signal is something like 90VAC
&gt; at 25Hz superimposed over the DC bias (which is how the exchange detects
&gt; that the phone has gone off hook and stops the ringing signal).  (All this
&gt; is bound to be wildly inaccurate due to deterioting brain cells).  Modern
&gt; electronic phones are built with so much tolerance these days that they'll
&gt; respond to anything that comes vaguely close.

Finally the right answer.  BTW, note that in Germany it's 60V.  I
brought some phones and a fax machine with me from Germany and found
they wouldn't work At All.  It seems that there's something in them
that insists on a minimum voltage.

This is for POTS, of course.  In Germany, ISDN basic rate was more
like 100V, but I don't know the exact value.
