Hi,
I just set this up today on RH7.2.
I followed the HOWTO on www.wu-ftp.org and got it working.
:/home/joe/ ./:  instead of having a space do it like this :/home/joe/./:
this is how i have it.
maybe this may help.
I did have some issues setting it up but just going over the HOWTO a few
times i manged to get it all working, Now just have to migrate all the
users...

Hello all,

I am running wu-ftp on redhat 7.0

im trying to limit the users to their home directory. the info i have seen
on the net says changing their entry in the /etc/passwrd file to:

:/home/joe/ ./:

...should fix this, i must be missing something because this doesnt work. i
have tried other variations as:

:/home/joe/ ./home/joe: (and a so on...)


im sure there are people on this list who have come accross this before. i
would prefer not changing ftp servers though. i've heard its easy to do on
others. 

Thanks,

Andrew Galdes
