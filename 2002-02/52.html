Wow, that certainly inspired some comments :)

What I intend to do is go through all of that, and generate a single 
reply which answers each distinct question that I've seen in the list 
so far.

Meantime, please remember that:

- We are trying to find a reasonable middle path on a hard road, 
without creating 50 different service offerings, and without creating 
outcomes that aren't financially sustainable (which doesn't help 
anyone in the long term).

- The financial equations that run behind these services are a -lot- 
more complex than most of the armchair analyses of them have tended 
to imply. Related to that somewhat, I can see some misunderstandings 
already about what I meant by the 'not intended to be used 24x7' 
statement in the T's and C's, so I'll clarify that in a separate 
posting. It isn't what some of you have taken it to mean.

- Where we are able to adjust or tune the offering so that it meets 
the needs of more people, we will do so. What we also have to do is 
avoid entering into a situation where we are chasing our own tail 
with changes to the structure of these offerings that are cyclic and 
non-convergent [1]

The thing I can promise you is that we aren't Telstra; We -are- 
listening, we are really, really interested in the feedback, and 
where we can turn it into a better or more appealing offering, we'll 
do that.

This does mean that in the meantime, those of you pitching questions 
at us are also going to have to expect to answer a few back from me, 
to help in the process of clearly understanding the drivers behind 
some of these issues.


Cheers,
Simon

[1] What I mean here is that some of you have said 'Its wonderful 
except for &lt;x&gt;'. Well, I challenge you to -buy- it from us if we 
address &lt;x&gt; to your satisfaction, without then saying 'Oh, thanks, 
but how about &lt;y&gt;, and -then- I'd like it', and repeating that 
iterative loop until one of us goes barking bad.  Support us, and 
we'll keep listening to your needs.
