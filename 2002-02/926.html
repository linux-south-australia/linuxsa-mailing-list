Uh,
Wasn't the OpenOffice codebase from the StarOffice code base to being with?

Anyway, the one thing that bugs me about this Sun charging thing is that it 
all originates from an obscure German magazine, but there's nothing concrete 
from Sun, even the quote is a bit misleading.

I wonder if it's an M$ FUD thing.  I could be wrong, but charging for SO6 
seems to be counter to what Sun wants to do with Linux.  Also, what 
wasn't clear from that article is whether Sun are going to charge for a box 
with a manual with support or for everything (including downloading it 
yourself).

Not sure if Sun making a Linux distro is a great idea, I reckon they should
buy an existing one to be honest, as the world doesn't need another
vendor-centric distro.

&gt; 
&gt; Just a small correction there, StarOffice is developed using a large
&gt; amount of the codebase from the OpenOffice project, not entirely by
&gt; Sun Corp themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; I see it as being similar to Redhat or Mandrake, they package it up
&gt; into a user friendly installation with their own utilities etc added
&gt; in and charge a nominal fee to cover the cost of doing this.
&gt; 
&gt; If Sun lose sight of the fact that StarOffice is being developed 
&gt; primarily by the OSS community then they deserve all the negative 
&gt; publicity they will get, but I think we should wait and see what
&gt; sort of pricing struccture they come up with.
