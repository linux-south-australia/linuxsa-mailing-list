Wayne:
 
&gt; 1) I have set up Interchange on my linux, and it seems to run very
&gt; well, lots of features. The problems I am having is the setting up of
&gt; tax and freight. Being coded in America these are designed to suit
&gt; their methods, which of course is fair enough.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else who is using Interchange made changes to the code to
&gt; work around these little problems ?

The problems aren't little. Considering that their talking about your
business finances they're reasonably major (just ask One.Tel).

&gt; If you have then I will be willing to pay for your source, provided it
&gt; is suitable and stable.

Why don't you just pay someone to fix it then?

&gt; 4) I am after an IDE application that runs on either Windows or Linux
&gt; for developing web pages in either PHP or Perl, for access MySQL
&gt; server. Are there any suggestions that you may be give me to help me
&gt; choose ?

Oh, emacs or vi will do. I don't think you understand what you're asking
to be honest and I can't be bothered second guessing you...
