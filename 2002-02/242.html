&gt; Apparently ETSA are now a registered carrier and are offering 100Mbit ethernet links around the state.

Although ETSA have now got their own Telco licence, they are partly
owned by Hutchinson/Orange and have 'borrowed' that Telco licence in the
past. ETSA have been building a hybrid Copper/Fibre/Microwave network
around Adelaide for the last 20 years, primarily to monitor the state's
power needs.

Believe it or not, but they've actually had DSL with comprehensive
coverage in the ground for ages, before starting to replace it with
Fibre. Now they're thinking that this leftover DSL network and excess
fibre capacity is worth selling to people. They already have a 24-hour
NOC, and a comms team .. it was a no-brainer to start making more use of
existing resources.

They started with a Telstra-ish model of charging obscene prices for
fancy telco-style interfaces. They then hired some decent techs and
management to build it further, and are currently doing most of their
work with Cisco switches and VLANs.

&gt; I'm not sure on pricing but Port Adelaide/Enfield council recently replaced their old WAN (ISDN and Frame Relay combination) with
&gt; 100Mbit to all their depots and offices. It has made their lives easier in that they don't have to wait 20 mins for their WTS client
&gt; to boot anymore :)
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone confirm this and offer a guide on pricing?

Consider it confirmed. Pricing is as always POA :)
