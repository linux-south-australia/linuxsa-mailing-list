&gt;Not only have Telstra simplified this process into an ISP product as
&gt;opposed to wholesale, but the new 'Option 2' allows ISP's to become ADSL
&gt;providers without even needing a tail to Telstra, by selling bundled
&gt;Telstra bandwidth and ADSL. It's been said that this will allow even
&gt;small ISP's to be price-competitive with Bigpond.

It'll be a good trick. I prefer having the use of lower cost 
non-Telstra bandwidth.

And it turns those ISP's into nothing but Telstra retail clones. Good 
luck for long term survival on that strategy.

['Oh, sorry, we know the Internet is down, but because we're nothing 
but a Telstra rebiller, we can't do a damn thing about it'].

You're welcome to that.

Personally, I'm trying to minimise my use of Telstra services, not 
maximise them. I appreciate that other ISP's are welcome to choose a 
different strategy, that's what the open market is all about.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;  It takes a few months to develop an offering around the new pricing
&gt;&gt;  because the -structural- shifts are so radical that they take some
&gt;&gt;  time to assimilate into rational retail pricing models that are
&gt;&gt;  sustainable for the ISP concerned.
&gt;
&gt;It might be radical compared to normal dialup (although an 18-hour
&gt;session timeout looks suspiciously similar to a 2^16 radius limitation),
&gt;but what makes you think that other ISP's havn't been preparing for this
&gt;since 2000?

Their absence from the market after having 18 months to plan their 
entry into it.

Cheers,
  Simon
