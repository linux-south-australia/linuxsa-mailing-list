&gt; Can you use a Linux box as a BGP route reflector or route server which
&gt; other routers can use as a source of routing information?  By all means,
&gt; yes.  But then, you can do that with pretty much anything else which
&gt; runs BGP.

Um, Cisco IOS doesn't support being an eBGP route server.  I'm
trying to get that feature added.

&gt; Would you trust your entire network to it?  No.  You can with pretty
&gt; much anything else which runs BGP.

That would explain why the major US peering points use RSd
on Linux to provide BGP services.  RSd is a gated variant.

&gt; zebra doesn't exactly run at "five nines" reliability levels.

Zebra isn't yet out of beta and it shows.

Cisco IOS isn't 99.999% either by the way.  The time to
boot the IOS uses the entire outage budget for the year.
So you need multiple boxes for 99.999%.  You could achieve
better figures with reliable PCs and BGP speakers from
different code bases (say gated and MRTd).

&gt; Can you use a Linux box as a BGP border router?  No - zebra doesn't
&gt; get enough link state information to do that properly.

The issue is that Zebra doesn't propogate carrier failure
to BGP.  Cisco IOS doesn't do it either unless you set

   router bgp ...
     bgp fast-external-failover

Unfortunately this instant propogation of local data link status
into the global routing table isn't good either.  There's really
no good alternative.
