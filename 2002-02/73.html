&gt; Does anyone here have problems using dyndns.org with linux and iHug?? I
&gt; signed up yesterday and it all should work but when I visit the url I

&gt; squid2.adl.ihug.com.au so I was thinking maybe iHug don't allow their
&gt; members to use dyndns for some stupid reason??

I have a dyndns domain pointed at my dingoblue dynamic IP.
I also have my proper domain (parachilna.com) such that for web
stuff it points to my dyndns domain and email it points to my
ihug account (done this way cos dingoblue mail servers are too
unreliable/have too many outages for my liking).  So it's not
quite like your setup but kinda similar, I've had no problems
with ihug or found anything they block.  I don't really see
how they could tell you've got a dyndns domain pointed to them
and don't see why they'd care even if they did/could.  It's
most likely a config error on your part (have you checked your
logs on your machine to see if ihug's proxy is trying to access
your machine?).
