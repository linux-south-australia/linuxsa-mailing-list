Hi, John Haddock.

&gt; jumping in at the deepend a bit as I'm attempting to setup a RH 7.2 server
&gt; as a proxy/firewall for my home network. I'm getting stuck on BPA login as
&gt; I'm a cable subscriber and naturally want to have my other machines access
&gt; the web safely and Linux would seem to be the safest, most economical way to
&gt; go.

... or FreeBSD. Though I'm not sure if bpalogin works with FreeBSD. I'm
offline now too, so I can't check at this moment.

&gt; My cable NIC is eth1 and is being seen by BigPond as it's being allocated an
&gt; address as seen in ifconf. I'm attempting to install BPA Login 2.0 as an RPM
&gt; but get a depcheck fail. During the install I'm telling it to set up as a
&gt; DFS and Samba server with a medium firewall. I've tried several installs
&gt; with different options but to no avail.

[ * andrew tries to remember RPM snafu ]

It sounds like a failed dependency check. There's no need to continually
reinstall RedHat, as it's the ancillary package that seems to be causing
grief.

Try the following:

# wget <A HREF="http://wherever.com/bpalogin.rpm">http://wherever.com/bpalogin.rpm</A>
# rpm -Uvvh bpalogin.rpm

That's putting rpm in "very verbose" mode, resulting in a whole heap of
fairly boring information being pushed out onto the screen. However, it
will ensure that you are getting all the information that you could
possibly want to ensure that the cause of the problem is found.

Can you run that command (as root, as indicated by the '#') and send the
output (if you can't make sense of it yourself)?

&gt; I can't help but think that I'm sniffing around it but there's probably
&gt; something obvious I can't see for looking.

Just send the rpm output.

&gt; Any guidance you can give will be gratefully received!

See above. Look forward hearing from you soon.
