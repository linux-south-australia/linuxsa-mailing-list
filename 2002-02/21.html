Hi,

Just a couple comments.  I was really looking foward to the Internode ADSL
product.  Unfortunately a couple issues with it that are a tad 'sucky'.

1.  The 18 hour session time limit.
2.  The 6 hour idle timeout.
3.  The blocking of ports under 1024

For these, the great pricing and the fact that Internode is the local
boys and all that, I can ignore points #1 and #2 and live with it.

But #3 is the reason that its not suitable for my use.  Currently I use
Telstra ADSL, which has both a web server, ssh and SMTP server on
it.  Running the web and ssh server on ports &gt;1024 will be easy, but 25
needs to be open so that mail is delivered.  And before anyone says 'but
its dynamic IP so how do you get mail delievered anyway?", all that is
used is a dyndns address as the MX record, which is updated each time a
new IP is obtained.

I guess I can understand why you guys are doing this, it stops you having
to worry about people having open relay servers, vunerable IIS web servers
and all that, but unfortunately it will stop me from using what overwise
could be a good service.

Simon, any chance of this being changed in the future, or am I stuck
with Telstra still?  :)

Cheers,
  Mark

&gt; 
&gt; I hope y'all like it.
&gt; 
&gt; A lot of effort has gone into trying to strike a balance between 
&gt; charging a fair price, and ensuring that the service is sustainable 
&gt; to provide.
&gt; 
&gt; Your comments, as always, are welcome. And so (at last!), are 
&gt; your orders :)
&gt; 
&gt; See
&gt; 	<A HREF="http://adsl.internode.on.net">http://adsl.internode.on.net</A>
&gt; 
&gt; For the good stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; (Especially the "more information" link, as well as (of course) the 
&gt; price list and order form links)
&gt; 
&gt; Orders taken now. Provisioning begins next week, with first service 
&gt; deliveries expected from the week after that. Now would be a great 
&gt; time to cancel your Telstra ADSL service and make the move.
&gt; 
&gt; NB for people who -are- moving from Telstra, note that you -do- need 
&gt; to disconnect with Telstra before we can reconnect you via Internode. 
&gt; There isn't any 'cleaner' way, and it does mean you'll have no 
&gt; broadband for a few days in the middle.
&gt; 
&gt; However, we do supply you with access to a nationally available dial 
&gt; account as an included part of our service, perfect for that 
&gt; transition period :)
&gt; 
&gt; [And, again, see the 'more information' link for other cool 
&gt; features as well]
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt;    Simon Hackett
