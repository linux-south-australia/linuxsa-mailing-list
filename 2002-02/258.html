Hi Daniel,

Thanks for your help. I guess it's just taking a while to get my head around
the concept of accepting and then denying. I am so used to seeing the deny
then accept syntax. I have tried doing the way you mentioned and things seem
to be working, I have a pretty good idea on which tcp ports I need to
'accept' but the udp I am not quite sure yet.
Basically I am using apache, ftp, sshd, named and also need ports 81, 443,
10000 and 25000 open also.

Any hints on which udp ports may be related to any of the above services ?

Thanks for taking the time to explain the rules, it has really helped.

Regards

Wayne

&gt; Hi Wayne,
&gt;
&gt; Don't know if anyone actually answered this one for you properly.
&gt; Forgive me if they already have ;-)
&gt;
&gt; At 04:51  7/02/02 +1030, you wrote:
&gt; &gt;I have tried to run lokkit on my Redhat 7.2 box which generates the
syntax
&gt; &gt;for ipchains-restore. I selected to only allow access through on about
&gt; &gt;five ports. But after restarting ipchains and testing it, I can still
&gt; &gt;access ports which I have not nominated to allow through. ie, I am
running
&gt; &gt;apache on port 80 and 81. I have selected port 80 to allow through and
&gt; &gt;have not mention 81 at all, but I can get to 81 with my browser on my
&gt; &gt;workstation.
&gt;
&gt; I'm taking a guess here that the workstation is on the same subnet as the
&gt; server's eth0 device?
&gt; Any connection to port 81 made via some other network interface (eg: eth1,
&gt; ppp0) should fail.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I doesn't seem to be allowing access on only the selected ports, and
&gt; &gt;denying the rest.
&gt;
&gt; Ahh, but it is not just on the basis of ports that you are ACCEPTing.
&gt; You also have two rules which ACCEPT any packets from the network devices:
&gt; lo (localhost) and eth0 (which was probably ticked in lokkit as a
"Trusted"
&gt; interface)
&gt; I'll show you what I'm rambling about below:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Please have a look at the script below and tell what looks wrong, or what
&gt; &gt;I should be trying to fix the problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;# Firewall configuration written by lokkit
&gt; &gt;# Manual customization of this file is not recommended.
&gt;
&gt; Here we have the default rules for each chain. They act as the
&gt; bottom of the rule stack. ie: inbound,outbound or forwarded packets
&gt; are 'sifted' down through the appropriate ipchain (list of rules) when
&gt; they arrive/depart/forward. The packet checks each rule as goes down
&gt; until it finds one that applies to it. At the bottom they find the default
&gt; policy.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;:input ACCEPT
&gt; &gt;:forward ACCEPT
&gt; &gt;:output ACCEPT
&gt;
&gt; It is common (and safest) with firewalling to take the approach of:
&gt; "Accept specifically what I want, then deny anything else"
&gt; That's why the default DENY policy was suggested. However, it is
&gt; already partially implied by the last 2 lines of you chain, which reject
&gt; any non-established TCP connections and/or any UDP datagrams.
&gt;
&gt; Here is the "What we want" list of tcp services:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 22 -p tcp -y -j ACCEPT
&gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 25 -p tcp -y -j ACCEPT
&gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 80 -p tcp -y -j ACCEPT
&gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 21 -p tcp -y -j ACCEPT
&gt;
&gt; Here are the "Who do we trust" interfaces:
&gt; (Remove the second one to test your port 81 theory)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 -i lo -j ACCEPT
&gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
&gt;
&gt; This bit is just an exception to the udp deny rule, so as
&gt; to allow DNS lookups to work properly:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;-A input -s 192.168.1.10 53 -d 0/0 -p udp -j ACCEPT
&gt; &gt;-A input -s 192.168.1.5 53 -d 0/0 -p udp -j ACCEPT
&gt;
&gt; And finally, we have the psuedo-default REJECT for tcp/udp packets:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 -p tcp -y -j REJECT
&gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 -p udp -j REJECT
&gt;
&gt; The default policy still applies to anything that makes it this far, but
by now
&gt; that will only be ICMP (ping, traceroute) packets and TCP packets which
&gt; have the ACK bit set on them (in human terms, they are part of an
established
&gt; tcp stream) which are fairly safe because their non-ACK bit predecessors
&gt; had to get
&gt; past the firewall to begin with.
&gt;
&gt; The main reason lokkit didn't set your default policy to REJECT/DENY was
&gt; because
&gt; it might serious limit some (if not all) of the return traffic from a
&gt; browser or ftp-client
&gt; run _from_ that server. All of those miscilaneous ACK-bit tcp packets
would
&gt; not make
&gt; it through the default DENY policy (and specifically enabling them would
be
&gt; a headache).
&gt; They setup RedHat all geared for an X-based console these days, so they
&gt; have to plan
&gt; around it having the same traffic directions as a workstation too.
&gt;
&gt; I would personally just re-think the rule that allows any eth0 borne
&gt; connections,
&gt; and then just add more ACCEPT rules (eg: for port 81).
&gt; Works for me (on RH 6.2, 7.1 & 7.2).
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt;
&gt; -Daniel
&gt;
&gt;
