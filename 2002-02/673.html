Quoting David Lloyd &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@rebel.net.au">lloy0076@rebel.net.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; &gt;&gt;No-one wants to help someone do their homework, without some kind of
&gt; mutual
&gt; &gt;&gt;help back. You might want to try writing something about what your major
&gt; &gt;&gt;research topic is, and then aim your emails towards potential employers
&gt; who
&gt; &gt;&gt;could *benefit* from that research.
&gt; 
&gt; I would have assumed that one of the benefits would be having some 
&gt; research done for nothing.

For very large values of "nothing". Unless the research the student is doing
doesn't require any familiarisation with the working environment at all
(ie, designing a system for an external client which doesn't need or use
any of the company's existing tech) chances are the employer is going to have
to write off a staff member for a week or four while he brings the newcomer
up to speed.

&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.smoothwall.org/download/pdf/docs/0.9.9/doc.faq.pdf">http://www.smoothwall.org/download/pdf/docs/0.9.9/doc.faq.pdf</A>  It's a
&gt; great
&gt; &gt; little article about how to write emails for help, what to write and what
&gt; &gt; not to write (and get your head bitten off).

There's a bunch of these around the place: ESR's written one
(www.tuxedo.org) and so has Greg Lehey (www.lemis.com). Unfortunately,
anybody patient enough to read the documents and considerate enough to take
heed of the information probably already writes concise and well formatted
questions to mailing lists.

That being said, I know I'd prefer an accurate problem description with
test cases and basic system configuration in a HTML email rather than a
perfectly formatted 72-character wide "My Linux is broken. I didn't change
anything. Help me!".
