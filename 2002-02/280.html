Hi Anthony

Thanks for the mention, I'll check to see if I have udp with port 53 in the
rules.



Regards

Wayne

&gt; named uses 53 udp for short lookups and tcp if the reply is over 1 packet
&gt; in size. Which means if you dont include it you get in intermittently
&gt; working scenareo.

&gt; &gt; Hi Daniel,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for your help. I guess it's just taking a while to get my head
around
&gt; &gt; the concept of accepting and then denying. I am so used to seeing the
deny
&gt; &gt; then accept syntax. I have tried doing the way you mentioned and things
seem
&gt; &gt; to be working, I have a pretty good idea on which tcp ports I need to
&gt; &gt; 'accept' but the udp I am not quite sure yet.
&gt; &gt; Basically I am using apache, ftp, sshd, named and also need ports 81,
443,
&gt; &gt; 10000 and 25000 open also.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any hints on which udp ports may be related to any of the above services
?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for taking the time to explain the rules, it has really helped.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Wayne

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Wayne,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't know if anyone actually answered this one for you properly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Forgive me if they already have ;-)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; At 04:51  7/02/02 +1030, you wrote:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I have tried to run lokkit on my Redhat 7.2 box which generates the
&gt; &gt; syntax
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;for ipchains-restore. I selected to only allow access through on
about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;five ports. But after restarting ipchains and testing it, I can still
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;access ports which I have not nominated to allow through. ie, I am
&gt; &gt; running
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;apache on port 80 and 81. I have selected port 80 to allow through
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have not mention 81 at all, but I can get to 81 with my browser on my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;workstation.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm taking a guess here that the workstation is on the same subnet as
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; server's eth0 device?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any connection to port 81 made via some other network interface (eg:
eth1,
&gt; &gt; &gt; ppp0) should fail.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I doesn't seem to be allowing access on only the selected ports, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;denying the rest.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ahh, but it is not just on the basis of ports that you are ACCEPTing.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You also have two rules which ACCEPT any packets from the network
devices:
&gt; &gt; &gt; lo (localhost) and eth0 (which was probably ticked in lokkit as a
&gt; &gt; "Trusted"
&gt; &gt; &gt; interface)
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll show you what I'm rambling about below:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Please have a look at the script below and tell what looks wrong, or
what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I should be trying to fix the problem.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;# Firewall configuration written by lokkit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;# Manual customization of this file is not recommended.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here we have the default rules for each chain. They act as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; bottom of the rule stack. ie: inbound,outbound or forwarded packets
&gt; &gt; &gt; are 'sifted' down through the appropriate ipchain (list of rules) when
&gt; &gt; &gt; they arrive/depart/forward. The packet checks each rule as goes down
&gt; &gt; &gt; until it finds one that applies to it. At the bottom they find the
default
&gt; &gt; &gt; policy.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;:input ACCEPT
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;:forward ACCEPT
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;:output ACCEPT
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is common (and safest) with firewalling to take the approach of:
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Accept specifically what I want, then deny anything else"
&gt; &gt; &gt; That's why the default DENY policy was suggested. However, it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; already partially implied by the last 2 lines of you chain, which
reject
&gt; &gt; &gt; any non-established TCP connections and/or any UDP datagrams.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is the "What we want" list of tcp services:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 22 -p tcp -y -j ACCEPT
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 25 -p tcp -y -j ACCEPT
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 80 -p tcp -y -j ACCEPT
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 21 -p tcp -y -j ACCEPT
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here are the "Who do we trust" interfaces:
&gt; &gt; &gt; (Remove the second one to test your port 81 theory)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 -i lo -j ACCEPT
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This bit is just an exception to the udp deny rule, so as
&gt; &gt; &gt; to allow DNS lookups to work properly:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;-A input -s 192.168.1.10 53 -d 0/0 -p udp -j ACCEPT
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;-A input -s 192.168.1.5 53 -d 0/0 -p udp -j ACCEPT
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And finally, we have the psuedo-default REJECT for tcp/udp packets:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 -p tcp -y -j REJECT
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 -p udp -j REJECT
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The default policy still applies to anything that makes it this far,
but
&gt; &gt; by now
&gt; &gt; &gt; that will only be ICMP (ping, traceroute) packets and TCP packets
which
&gt; &gt; &gt; have the ACK bit set on them (in human terms, they are part of an
&gt; &gt; established
&gt; &gt; &gt; tcp stream) which are fairly safe because their non-ACK bit
predecessors
&gt; &gt; &gt; had to get
&gt; &gt; &gt; past the firewall to begin with.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The main reason lokkit didn't set your default policy to REJECT/DENY
was
&gt; &gt; &gt; because
&gt; &gt; &gt; it might serious limit some (if not all) of the return traffic from a
&gt; &gt; &gt; browser or ftp-client
&gt; &gt; &gt; run _from_ that server. All of those miscilaneous ACK-bit tcp packets
&gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; not make
&gt; &gt; &gt; it through the default DENY policy (and specifically enabling them
would
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; a headache).
&gt; &gt; &gt; They setup RedHat all geared for an X-based console these days, so
they
&gt; &gt; &gt; have to plan
&gt; &gt; &gt; around it having the same traffic directions as a workstation too.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would personally just re-think the rule that allows any eth0 borne
&gt; &gt; &gt; connections,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and then just add more ACCEPT rules (eg: for port 81).
&gt; &gt; &gt; Works for me (on RH 6.2, 7.1 & 7.2).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope this helps,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; -Daniel
