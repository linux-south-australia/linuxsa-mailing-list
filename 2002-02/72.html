runbox.com used to provide pretty decent services, though they are now
no longer free. This could be an advantage though if you can pay the
price, as they used to have periods of time where you couldn't login
(they had such a good services that too many people joined up. maybe now
not so many people are members, or at least the money they get can
support them). A good free pop provider I have found is gmx.net although
they are a german site but when you just use a mail program, who cares?
They only thing with them though is that they delete mail after 30 days,
as long as you check it before then though it is on your computer
anyway.

&gt; Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; I have tried several free web mail providers including Hotmail and
&gt; Yahoo, and am becoming more annoyed with these services, as they do not
&gt; provide the depth of features available in many mail clients such as
&gt; Netscape Messenger and Mozilla Mail-News.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for a mail account I can access most anywhere that has good
&gt; filtering, good storage options (such as folders and subfolders), allows
&gt; me to store a resonable amount of mail, and is highly reliable.  It
&gt; would also be desirable if this client had a web interface so it could
&gt; be accessed in any web browser, did not have excessive advertising,
&gt; filtered bulk/spam mail, could receive mail sent to a domain I
&gt; registered, and provided other features such as downloading all my mail
&gt; to a local file.
&gt; 
&gt; I have come to think that perhaps an IMAP mail account would be best, as
&gt; these features would rely more on the mail client's (MUA's) abilities,
&gt; rather than the limited features that most public mail accounts seem to
&gt; provide.  It would seem to costly for me to run my own mail server.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anybody suggest a public IMAP mail account (free or fee) that
&gt; satisfies all these criteria?  Can anybody suggest a web mail account
&gt; that does these things?  Any other ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to anybody who can help.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
