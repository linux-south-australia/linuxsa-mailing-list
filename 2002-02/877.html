OK,

This has nothing to do with a proxy or the Internet. It is a database
application that users telnet or ssh into and run from remote sites.
What I would like to do is duplicate the entire box ie. sit an exact copy of
the first server along side the first and have it ready to come on line
automatically if the first one falls over. Continuous uptime is very import
to these people as everything hangs off the main database.

HTH.

Steve

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone had any experience in setting mirrored servers.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think you'll need to specify more clearly what you mean. Just as a
&gt; start do you mean:
&gt;
&gt; * mirror the whole file system?
&gt; * mirror just the database onto one or more servers, and then load
&gt; balance the whole lot through some sort of proxy server?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a
&gt; &gt; requirement for a lot of speed ie. a big database with maybe serveral
&gt; &gt; hundred users and also need some redundancy.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You might want to look at <A HREF="http://linux-ha.org/">http://linux-ha.org/</A>
&gt;
&gt; That's the high availability sight.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I have had a quite look at Beowulf but I am not sure if this a bit of an
&gt; &gt; over kill.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Or even the right tool. I thought that applications needed to be written
&gt; ground up to run on a Beowulf server but I may be just plain wrong.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions welcome as I have no experience in this area.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Well, all real databases (i.e. Oracle, DB2, MySQL, Postgres) now support
&gt;   live replication to some degree.
&gt;
&gt; That is to say you write to database A and the write is then committed
&gt; to database B. You can make this completely atomic; that is to say if
&gt; the write to B does not occur then the whole transaction fails.
&gt; Naturally, database A could write to many databases.
&gt;
&gt; You would then, at least when reading, be able to sit a proxy-load
&gt; balancing server which doles out read requests to your farm of
&gt; databases. I suspect that Oracle and DB2 might be able to do this
&gt; without the existence of outside utilities...
&gt;
&gt; I would strongly suggest you sacrifice speed for reliability. You can
&gt; make the database really fast by losing all your data but that kinda
&gt; misses the point.
