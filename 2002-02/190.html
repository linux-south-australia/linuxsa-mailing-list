&gt; Nope, that pricing and structural shift happened in November. Your

There are apparently a few differences to the 'November' pricing. This
is a very recent development, and is also accompanied by an 'Option 2'.

&gt; In March, that pricing just becomes slightly more generally available
&gt; to other wholesale customers of Telstra who choose to go through the
&gt; heartache of establishing themselves as direct Telstra wholesale xDSL
&gt; access customers (and it still -is- painful, but we did it a year
&gt; ago, so that pain is over for us...)

Not only have Telstra simplified this process into an ISP product as
opposed to wholesale, but the new 'Option 2' allows ISP's to become ADSL
providers without even needing a tail to Telstra, by selling bundled
Telstra bandwidth and ADSL. It's been said that this will allow even
small ISP's to be price-competitive with Bigpond.
 
&gt; It takes a few months to develop an offering around the new pricing
&gt; because the -structural- shifts are so radical that they take some
&gt; time to assimilate into rational retail pricing models that are
&gt; sustainable for the ISP concerned.

It might be radical compared to normal dialup (although an 18-hour
session timeout looks suspiciously similar to a 2^16 radius limitation),
but what makes you think that other ISP's havn't been preparing for this
since 2000?
