 &gt; I hate to pick on such a good service, (and you did ask for
 &gt; comments :P ) but one thing comes to mind - how about some
 &gt; differential charging so that people can download stuff from
 &gt; local sites (eg Netcraft's Linux FTP Server - which I beleive
 &gt; is in Internode's server room) at little or no cost - surely
 &gt; this doesn't cost Internode anything :)

We thought long and hard about this.

The outcome was something like this:  "Well, we could implement 
differential charging, in which case we'd need to delay the product
launch while we wrote the software to do it, and we'd need to pay
someone to write the software, and we'd spend the rest of our lives
answering billing complaints from people who were dead sure that 
all their usage was local, even though it wasn't..."

"... or we could build extraordinarily large volume committments into
the package, on the assumption that some percentage of that volume 
is `local'".

Look at the pricing:  You get 4.5 Gbytes at 256kbps for $89.95 - That's
less than 2c/Mbyte.

The high volume committments have also been geared so that someone who
spends their entire lives playing online games is highly unlikely to run
into an excess bill.  4.5 Gbytes is a *lot* of gaming.

I tried an internal modem,                    <A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">newton@atdot.dotat.org</A>
     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
