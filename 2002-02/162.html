The TIO is an office of *last* resort.

Step one would surely be to /read/ the contract you signed, see what
it says about cancellations, and determine whether Telstra is following
it to the letter.

If they are following it to the letter, the TIO's response will be,
"No, sorry, they're doing exactly what you agreed they should do,"
and you will have wasted your time.

If they're not following it to the letter, you take it up with Telstra
first (if you don't get any joy from the person you talk to, ask to
talk to their superior, and keep going until they won't let you talk 
to any other superiors).  If you fail to do that before you go to the
TIO, the TIO's answer will be, "Customer has not given Telstra the 
opportunity to settle the issue internally, therefore there is not
yet any cause for adjudication."

This all gets back to why it's so important to read the terms and
conditions which govern any Internet access supply:  A lot of people
seem to sign contracts which can be boiled down to, "The Supplier
Is Permitted To Do Something You Hate," then they get irate when
the supplier actually /does/ something they hate.
