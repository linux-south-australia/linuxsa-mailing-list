Mind you, europe seems to be doing the best these days..
A friend in Sweden ordered a 10MBit link, it was installed a few months ago,
and he pays something that equates to about 25-30 dollars a month, flatrate.
No caps. I don't know where he is getting it from.

Another friend in Amsterdam has a 2MBit DSL link, no limits; he was paying
more per month (if you converted to AU$).

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Well, I got DSL up under Linux in Mountain View last night ...
&gt;
&gt; A co-worker lent me a DSL modem ... and it came up easily under Linux.
&gt; Turns out that the SpeedTouch PC probably would have come up under Linux
&gt; as well, but I had a wireless card in the machine and PCMCIA was not
&gt; beeping when it loaded the wireless driver, so I was not aware, and I
&gt; had told PPPOE to use the eth device that was really wireless and ... :-(
&gt;
&gt; In any case, DSL with PacBell is $49.95 a month for 1.5Mb/s down and
&gt; 128kb/s up, no fixed IP.
&gt;
&gt; For $69.95 a month you can have 5 fixed IPs and it increases to 384kb/s up.
&gt;
&gt; If you sign up for 12 months, you get the modem for free, otherwise they
&gt; charge you $99 for the modem.
&gt;
&gt; These charges seem comparible to the Oz scene, which I find incredible
&gt; [1], except that there are no download caps [2]. There are also cheaper
&gt; suppliers around [3].
&gt;
&gt; The amusing event that happened was that I called PacBell tech support
&gt; about my Linux issue. The nice person on the other end was unable to
&gt; help me and pointed the Linux was outside their support guarantee, but
&gt; gave me the Linux 1-800 number. When I rang that number, it turned out
&gt; to be LinkSys tech support :-)
&gt;
&gt; [1] The Oz prices are very keen given that the Telstra and Optus charges
&gt; are such a large proportion of the costs to ISPs.
&gt;
&gt; [2] Some ISPs, it seems, will do bandwidth limiting if they determine
&gt; that you are using too much.
&gt;
&gt; [3] It is pretty clear that PacBell is going to be around for a long
&gt; time. Many of the cheaper suppliers are using Covad, and it is not clear
&gt; how long they will be around.
