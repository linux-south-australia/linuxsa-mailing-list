A little oblique to this - but here goes.
I have run Red Hat & Mandrake, played with Knoppix, & Lindows for over a year
now.

My kids (8 & 10) insist on a version of Linux at home & use certain
applications much more proficiently than I.

Unfortunately, I as a life scientist have found, the Linux forum as fascinating
as it is - too time consuming to get to the applications end.  I'm not
comfortable & confident enough to set it up, rely on it & know I can trouble
shoot quickly & effectively.  Yet I need to run biological *nix applications, &
connect to various clusters.

The result: at 40 yrs of age I bought my first Mac (1.25MHz G4 PowerBook).  I
am now able to stop concerning myself with which distro & get on with the job.
In three weeks I feel comfortable configuring preferences, & now rely on the
machine for most of my work.

A simple guide to which distro with blunt pros & cons so a potential user
didn't have to feel they were taking a punt as to which time consuming
investment to follow would help.

I'll continue to use Linux at home (although now competing with OS 10.3).  As a
researcher I understand the departure a discipline needs to take from the
pedestrian to develop & evolve.  I just wish I didn't feel so pedestrian in an
area I have  such an interest in.

Martin Lewis.
