Hey all,

Thought I'd throw some thought-provoking questions onto the intellectual =
fire that is this mailing list.

Following along from television series' such as Big Brother and =
Survivor, television stations seem to have jumped at the idea and =
introduced numerous new series' based on the reality television concept. =
Some people may say that it is going too far. Some, such as my =
high-school headmaster, go as far to say that the concept is evil and is =
contributing to the demise of human society. Others will just follow the =
crowd like the sheep that they are, and like and accept what the media =
dictates them to like and accept.

Was Australian Idol and the other Idol series' different to the Big =
Brother style of reality television? Does the fact that they have to be =
good at what they do to win the competition rather than to simply be =
accepted by the other "characters" on the television show make any =
difference?

Is it going too far? Do we really care what these people think and do? =
Do we want to watch humans fall to such low standards as they turn =
against each other to succeed at whatever it is they are supposed to be =
succeeding at?

Is there anything else that anyone wants to bring up? What are your own =
thoughts on reality television?

I look forward to reading your responses, and to partaking in the =
discussion that follows.

- Adam
