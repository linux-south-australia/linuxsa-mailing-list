&gt;Although I understand that the USA is different in the way their phone 
&gt;system works (eg. mobiles pay for in and outgoing calls) they do seem to get 
&gt;some amazingly cheap deals compared to use (thousands of minutes per month) 
&gt;and they seem to get data chucked in for free, as opposed to the 
&gt;extortionate amount mobile carriers in AU charge.
&gt;
Compared to the USA, Australian telcos have mobiles WORKED OUT

in the USA it is a world of pain getting a mobile.. and they cost HEAPS...

each area has its own networks, at least in Australia you get Telstra 
you know it'll work everywhere
.. this is NOT so in the USA

+ in the USA, if you leave the area your mobile is registered in, you 
might have to pay a lot more /minute.. i think its cos there are 
hundreds of these little networks everywhere.... in australia you have 
to pay 30c/min but at least you're free to do this anywhere... and 
you'll know what it'll cost...

my gf lived in USA for 5 months and the pain she went thru to get a 
mobile.. ....

australia is MUCH better for mobile service than USA

seems that Asia has MUCH cheaper sms tho..
