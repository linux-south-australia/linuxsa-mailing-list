&gt;----- Original Message ----- 
&gt;From: Adam Towill
&gt;Hey all,
&gt;
&gt;Following along from television series' such as Big Brother and Survivor,
television stations seem to have &gt;jumped at the idea and introduced numerous
new series' based on the reality television concept. Some &gt;people may say
that it is going too far. Some, such as my high-school headmaster, go as far
to say that &gt;the concept is evil and is contributing to the demise of human
society. Others will just follow the crowd &gt;like the sheep that they are,
and like and accept what the media dictates them to like and accept.

I'll go against the popular trend and say I quite enjoy Survivor.  I have
only watched season 6 (Amazon) and season 7 (Pearl Islands), and All Stars
which has just started.  Right from the beginning (2000) I poo-pooed the
whole 'reality TV' concept and brushed off people who watched it.  Sometimes
I think I was pretty arrogant about it, because it was 'cool' to 'hate',
'reality TV'.

But then I watched the program, and realised it was just mild amusement for
1 out of approximately 112 waking hours every week.  The program doesn't
distract me from finding out about what the government is doing, reading the
news or studying another language.  _People_ are to blame for their poor
choices if they choose to get tied up for hours on end around the proverbail
water cooler about what Richard Hatch did or said last show.  I don't watch
HotHouse, Bachelor, Bachelorette, Big Brother, Queer Eye etc. because I
choose not to.  There's a little 'off' button on each TV set which some
people have difficulty finding.

Survivor et al are just a different twist on the same old gameshows that
have inhabited Australian television for almost fifty years.

What would you like to see on television, to fill all those endless hours of
programming that must be occupied each week?
