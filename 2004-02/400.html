I'm not totally opposed to the idea of email attracting a per-recipient
fee.  I am opposed to the idea having to pay for email, but I'm even
more opposed to the idea of having to receive spam.  I don't know how
to solve the spam problem but I'm pretty sure that making email cost
something, and it doesn't really matter how small an amount, will change
the economics of the business.  10,000,000 addresses at 0.1 cents each
is huge if you only expect to get ten to one hundred responses.

I doubt that introduction of a pay-per-message email system would
automatically result in the demise of the current free system.
Probably you'd be offered the current spammy account, which would be
free, or if you want you could use the pay-per-use system, which would
use a different email address, and from which you could only receive
email from other pay-per-use accounts.

I don't know how the fee per message would be collected, but I suppose
it would only be practical if it were collected (and kept) by your ISP.

There would be an interesting side-effect of such a system: Being
infected by virii/worms would cost you a fortune.  I think users would
care a lot more than they do now about this, and would become just that
much more careful in their email and browsing habbits.
