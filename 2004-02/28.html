magpie said:
&gt; Knoppix is a good introduction to Debian. And maybe for a firewall it
&gt; is ok. But for a Desktop box in a small office it lacks the
&gt; configuration  utilities like Mandrake, Suse.

I would've thought knoppix was aimed at the desktop use,
rather than as a firewall (but I haven't played with
knoppix very much apart from booting it and fiddling
for a few minutes).  Advantage would be easy to add
stuff with apt-get though (so I hear anyway).

For what you're talking about, I wouldn't have thought
debian would suit (assuming you don't want to spend the
time installing and getting everything set up).

Ultimately I think you're going to have to try a
few and see for yourself.  Perhaps try Fedora if you
already know suse and mandrake.

Dave.
