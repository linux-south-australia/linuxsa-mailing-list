 Geeks Put the Unsavvy on Alert: Learn or Log Off

 Got a computer virus? Cry on your own time, the once helpful say.

 By AMY HARMON (New York Times, February 5th 2004)

 When Scott Granneman, a technology instructor, heard that one of
 his former students had clicked on a strange e-mail attachment
 and infected her computer with the MyDoom Internet virus last
 week, empathy did not figure anywhere in his immediate response.

 'You actually got infected by the virus?' he wrote in an e-mail
 message to the former student, Robin Woltman, a university grant
 administrator. 'You, Robin? For shame!'

 As MyDoom, the fastest-spreading virus ever, continues to clog e-
 mail in-boxes and disrupt business, the computer-savvy are
 becoming openly hostile toward the not-so-savvy who unwittingly
 play into the hands of virus writers.

 The tension over the MyDoom virus underscores a growing friction
 between technophiles and what they see as a breed of technophobes
 who want to enjoy the benefits of digital technology without
 making the effort to use it responsibly.

 The virus spreads when Internet users ignore a basic rule of
 Internet life: never click on an unknown e-mail attachment. Once
 someone does, MyDoom begins to send itself to the names in that
 person's e-mail address book. If no one opened the attachment,
 the virus's destructive power would never be unleashed.

 'It takes affirmative action on the part of the clueless user to
 become infected,' wrote Scott Bowling, president of the World
 Wide Web Artists Consortium, expressing frustration on the
 group's discussion forum. 'How to beat this into these people's
 heads?'

 Many of the million or so people who have so far infected their
 computers with MyDoom say it is not their fault. The virus often
 comes in a message that appears to be from someone they know,
 with an innocuous subject line like 'test' or "error." It is
 human nature, they say, to open the mail and attachments.

 But computer sophisticates say it reflects a willful ignorance of
 basic computer skills that goes well beyond virus etiquette. At a
 time when more than two-thirds of American adults use the
 Internet, they say, such carelessness is no longer excusable,
 particularly when it messes things up for everyone else.

 For years, many self-described computer geeks seemed eager to
 usher outsiders onto their electronic frontier. Everyone, it
 seemed, had a friend or family member in the geek elite who could
 be summoned - often frequently - in times of computer crisis.

 But as those same friends and family members are called upon
 again and again to save the computer incompetents from
 themselves, the geeks' patience is growing thin. As it does, a
 new kind of digital divide is opening up between populations of
 computer users who must coexist in the same digital world.

 'Viruses are just the tip of the iceberg,' said Bill Melcher, who
 runs his own technical support business in San Francisco. 'When
 it comes to computers, a lot of intelligent people and fast
 learners just decide that they don't know.'

 Many of the computationally confused say they suffer from genuine
 intimidation and even panic over how to handle the mysterious
 machines they have come to rely on for so much of daily life.
 Virus writers, spammers and scammers, they say, are the ones who
 should be held accountable for the chaos they cause.

 But as the same people equip themselves with fancy computers and
 take advantage of the Internet for things like shopping and
 banking, critics say that their perpetual state of confusion has
 begun to get tiresome. And while the Internet's traditional
 villains remain elusive, those inadvertently helping them tend to
 be friends and neighbors.

 Some in the technocamp imagine requiring a license to operate a
 computer, just like the one required to drive a car. Others are
 calling for a punishment that fits a careless crime. People who
 click on virus attachments, for instance, could be cut off by
 their Internet service providers until they proved that their
 machines had been disinfected.

 And some, tired of being treated like free help lines, are
 beginning to rebel. They are telling friends, relatives and
 random acquaintances to figure it out on their own.

 'Go out, get a book," suggests Zack Rubenstein, 28, who has for
 years provided free technical support for his extended social
 network.' You went to college and you got a degree, you obviously
 can learn something. Play around with it; it's not going to kill
 you.'

 Mr. Rubenstein, a member of the technical support staff at a New
 York City law school he thought it best not to identify, is not
 at liberty to dispense such advice at work. Instead, he answers
 endless calls about malfunctioning monitors that turn out not to
 be plugged in, and broken printers that start working again as
 soon as he removes the single piece of paper obviously jamming
 them.

 'Especially dealing with academics,' Mr. Rubenstein added, 'you'd
 think they'd have some ability to deduce or think problems
 through for a minute.'

 Not so long ago, he took pleasure in showing people around the
 brave new digital world that he moved in with such ease. Now that
 everyone has a technical question, he says, being a tour guide
 has lost its charm.

 But his girlfriend, Miriam Tauber, 24, makes no apologies for her
 lack of computer knowledge. To her, computers are like 'moody
 people' who behave illogically. If people like Mr. Rubenstein
 expect her to understand them, she suggests, perhaps they should
 learn to speak in a language she can understand, rather than
 ridiculous acronyms and suffixes.

 'There are these MP3's and PDF's and a million other things that
 you don't even know what they are,' Ms. Tauber said. 'I don't
 feel like I need to figure out computers, because my instinct is
 there's just no way.'

 Still, if there is any evidence that the antagonism of the
 technical elite is having an effect, it may be in the mounting
 degree of shame among those who make obvious mistakes, or ask
 obvious questions too often.

 When Julie Dillon, 33, had trouble installing a wireless card in
 her Macintosh laptop last weekend, for instance, she stopped
 herself from calling a friend three blocks away who works for
 Apple Computer because she knows he is besieged.

 'There's this whole complicated interchange - are you calling
 then as a friend or are you calling them as tech support - and I
 definitely feel s little bit guilty,' said Ms. Dillon, a musician
 in San Francisco. 'It's a fine line that has changed because I
 remember a few years ago it was no big deal.'

 Instead, Ms. Dillon called Mr. Melcher, who has built his
 technical support business in part on referrals from friends who
 no longer wanted to handle the demands of other friends.

 Ms. Dillon, who considers her laptop "a blessing" that helps her
 promote her music, said she was happy to pay for the help. She
 has also frequently received technical sup port in exchange for
 dinner, and once, for a song.

 Even parents are being left to fend for themselves as their
 children tire of dispensing advice.

 David Hale, 25, a lawyer in St. Louis, said he had rebuilt his
 parents’' virus-ridden computer from scratch several times in
 recent months before he learned that his father, Dale, was
 replying to every piece of his spam e-mail, asking to be taken
 off the spammers’ mailing lists. Dale Hale, 47, also frequently
 clicked on pop-up ads that appeared to be messages from Microsoft
 telling him to upgrade his computer.

 'It would cause fights between my parents because they would
 argue about whether a particular one was legitimate and I'm like,
 ‘It is NEVER legitimate,’ ' said Mr. Hale, who explained as
 patiently as he could that answering spam and clicking on pop-ups
 only invite more of the same.

 After that, Dale Hale said, his son would sometimes become
 frustrated by his and his wife’s questions. They in turn would
 get frustrated with their son’s instructions, especially over the
 phone. Eventually they bought anti-virus software.

 'We've learned by the lumps and bumps,' the father said. (People
 who had installed the major anti-virus software programs from
 companies like McAfee were largely protected from the MyDoom
 virus after downloading updates available a few hours after the
 virus’s appearance on Jan. 26.)

 Perhaps the one thing that technophobes and technophiles can
 agree on is that software companies like Microsoft should make
 things easier and more secure for all kinds of computer users.
 But Microsoft, whose Web site has so far withstood a continuing
 attack by the MyDoom virus, had a reminder for users, too.
 'Responsibility is shared,' said Scott Charney, Microsoft's chief
 security strategist. 'With some of these viruses that require
 user action, people have a responsibility to be careful and
 protect themselves.'
