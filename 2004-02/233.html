Darryl,

I'll personally commit to working out why that has happened for you, and
fixing it.

Can you drop me a line directly with the open sales ticket numbers in it?

We are most of the way toward an integration of the sales and support
ticketing systems (they're different today, its a long story), and at that
point I expect us to be able to nail whatever the residual issue is in the
sales queue handling because it'll fall under the same common reporting and
escalation systems that are used on the support side.

I.e. Meanwhile, thanks for the constructive criticism:  The integration of
the electronic response management environments here, so that there is no
way that any ticket can find a little corner to hide in and get lost, is
something very very dear to my heart, and I'm very happy that we're nearly
'there' on it. Frankly it -has- been a cause of some pain for a while in
terms of the sales ticketing system to date.

It'll be fixed. 

Thanks,
   Simon

&gt; Internode's support is really good, the 2 or 3 times I've needed to call
&gt; them I've received good prompt service..
&gt; 
&gt; But don't bother sending email to their sales team.. I don't think there
&gt; is one..
&gt; 
&gt; I've sent maybe 10 emails to <A HREF="mailto:sales@internode.on.net">sales@internode.on.net</A> over the last year
&gt; or so and I think the quickest response time to my initial enquiry was
&gt; 13 days. Some of them I'm still waiting for.
&gt; 
&gt; I've sent 2 emails earlier this week so I'll expect I might get a
&gt; response towards the end of next week.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe the auto-responder thinks it is the sales team and it keeping
&gt; them.. :)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Darryl

&gt;&gt; I'd recommend Internode for this scenario.  Indeed, I've also heard a
&gt;&gt; lot of people say that the support has gone down the drain, which is a
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; shame - they're a great company.  :-(
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For the record - I've heard a lot of people (mostly our paying
&gt; customers) say the opposite - that our support quality is consistently
&gt; improving over time, and that its generally great. In particular we
&gt; receive a lot of unsolicited mail from our customers saying the exact
&gt; opposite to the above.
&gt; 
&gt; Now this is a classic case of the old chestnut: If you like &lt;x&gt;, please
&gt; tell your friends, if you don't, please tell us.
&gt; 
&gt; And seriously: We don't (ever) claim perfection, but we do continue to
&gt; strive for it. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you could just ask that 'lot of people' you know to simply tell us
&gt; what happened (via email to <A HREF="mailto:feedback@internode.on.net">feedback@internode.on.net</A>) then our senior
&gt; management team will do their level best to fix it. Every time I've had
&gt; this sort of assertion, and dug in to it, we've resolved it
&gt; satisfactorily in the presence of an actual complaint, not hearsay.
&gt; Hearsay is really hard to respond to.
&gt; 
&gt; No company whose reputation is built on great support (as ours is)
&gt; enjoys hearing that sort of generalisation without knowing enough
&gt; details to do something about it.
&gt; 
&gt; As the person who started, and still runs, Internode, I take this sort
&gt; of thing very personally - and I sincerely mean what I'm saying about
&gt; wanting to understand and fix any instance of a customer feeling that
&gt; their support experience hasn't been what they needed it to be.
&gt; 
&gt; We have, sincerely, put -enormous- resources into our support teams and
&gt; support mechanisms over time, and those resources are only on the rise;
&gt; We really, really value feedback to <A HREF="mailto:feedback@internode.on.net">feedback@internode.on.net</A> telling us
&gt; what sort of job we're doing, so we can do a better one. Really.
&gt; 
&gt; In terms of actual statistics on this sort of thing, just to underscore
&gt; my point here, take a look at the recently released independent survey
&gt; about broadband services published by APC magazine this month (Feb
&gt; 2004), and based on a survey of Whirlpool users late last year.
&gt; 
&gt; In that survey, this is how customers surveyed rated their ISP on
&gt; service:
&gt; 
&gt; Westnet 97%
&gt; Internode 93%
&gt; Swiftel 84%
&gt; IiNet 79%
&gt; DART 77%
&gt; Netspace 67%
&gt; OptusNet 55%
&gt; Datafast 36%
&gt; TPG 33%
&gt; Bigpond ADSL: 24%
&gt; Bigpond Cable: 21%
&gt; 
&gt; (the table lists ISPs who received more than 100 responses from
&gt; customers of that ISP - total sample size &gt; 10,000).
&gt; 
&gt; Many other interesting stats in the same issue.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd love nothing more than to bring our percentage even higher, by
&gt; improving our services even more. That simply needs us to receive direct
&gt; feedback on any cases in which we didn't deliver enough hugs. We are
&gt; genuinely interested in them. The folk at Internode, many of whom have
&gt; been actively supporting the Linux community for a very long time, do
&gt; this for love at least as much as they do this for money. No kidding.
&gt; 
&gt; (And besides: Which other ISP do you know that paid to have Linus
&gt; dunked?)
&gt; 
&gt; That is my $0.02 worth, anyway. Thanks for listening.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards, 
&gt; Simon Hackett
