&gt;&gt;yes it's interesting the way people just accept the
&gt;&gt;manufacturers line about X number dead is ok, more than
&gt;&gt;that and they will fix/replace it.  So X-1 dead is somehow
&gt;&gt;not covered by warranty?  Who gives the manufacturer the
&gt;&gt;right to decide how many dead is and is not acceptable?
&gt;&gt;If it happens to my laptop (within warranty) no doubt
&gt;&gt;I will find the answers to these questions.
&gt; 
&gt; The manufacturer has a right to decide the manufacturing tolerances.  Dead
&gt; pixels and subpixels are only created at manufacture time.  If I declare
&gt; that my car is meant to be built to 0.01mm tolerances, while the
&gt; manufacturer guarantees 0.1mm, I have no right to demand the item to be
&gt; fixed.

there's a bit of difference in eg. car panel gaps, which make
no difference to the performance etc of the car (and besides which
everyone knows commode/falcons aren't built to the same standard
as say BMW and this is reflected in the price), and parts of
a laptop screen not working, ie. it's faulty.

&gt; The customer can shop around for the LCD warranty policy that suits
&gt; their needs.  It only gets sticky when unsuspecting customers who fork out
&gt; the extra dollars are suprised by dead pixels (I doubt anyone savvy enough
&gt; to be on LinuxSA is unaware of LCD technology limitations).
&gt; 
&gt; I have avoided dead pixels/subpixels by viewing my screens at the store
&gt; before purchasing.  I wouldn't buy a screen through mail order without a
&gt; guarantee as provided by Acer or Philips.

I see it as a variation of the way people accept substandard
things when it comes to computers that they wouldn't for
anything else.

Dave.
