&gt; it's interesting, almost everyone in my road has internet access
&gt; (dodgy dialup on the whole) so there's some interest.
&gt; Trouble is most people probably don't care enough to do anything
&gt; about it but if adsl was available and some people had it and talked
&gt; about it to neighbours etc I reckon it would "catch on".

I agree.  I finally got my Dad to switch.  I think his problems with 
making the leap were:

- unfamiliarity with the technology and what actually has to happen to 
get it working.
- cost in the startup (eg. purchasing a modem/router, startup costs 
which amounted to almost $300 all up)
- understanding the monthly cost vs dialup
- understanding the benefits (no dialup, extra speed etc).

To put this into context - my Dad is (was?) a computer person.  He was a 
cobol programmer who moved into management (and now has gone way above 
IT management).  My family is IT literate.

However, it took me to "push" them over the edge.  Now they have it, 
they love it.  It costs them a bit more ($10-$15pm) than dialup, but has 
more functionality (the ADSL modem/router has finally allowed them to 
network their computers as well).  One of the reasons was to be able to 
use FreeWorldDial (<A HREF="http://www.pulver.com/fwd">http://www.pulver.com/fwd</A>) to talk to my sister who's 
in Austria for 6months studying.

I agree with DavidF that ADSL is definately a technology that the masses 
need a "helpful friend" to get them to move over.  Really, most people 
who use the internet any amount for "normal purposes" only see around a 
$10pm difference in cost. (eg. $29.95 per month dialup plus calls vs a 
$50/pm ADSL account) but the $300 or so startup can be a killer.

I believe that the $39.95 per month for a useful account (eg. 2GB or 
more - preferably with kiddy proof caps to stop unbounded cost) is 
really where things need to be.  To get there, Telstra is going to have 
to slash the wholesale rate.   To give another analogy Foxtel struggles 
to get higher penetration with a less useful product (passive TV) at 
"around" $50 pm starting price.  Foxtel would get many more people at a 
lower price (supply/demand yadda yadda).

Personally I think Telstra is doing their usual thing of holding the 
prices high as long as possible and growing by gradually extending 
coverage.  Eventually they know the wholesale price will drop.  [insert 
MMC's usual government supported Monopoly rant].   Prior example: ISDN
