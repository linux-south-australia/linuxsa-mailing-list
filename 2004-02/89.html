Windows 'firewalls' like this scare me; the amount of virii around that 
attempt to disable them are plentiful.  I've also seen more then one 
(i.e. not just ZoneAlarm) completely kill the TCP stack on the system; 
most of the time it is fixable, but the steps involved would confuse 
the hell out of an average user.

They're certainly useful for the "This application is trying to connect 
to X server at X port" (I use an application called "Little Snitch" on 
my mac that does the same thing), but I personally can't trust them for 
their firewall functionality.  They do work, and can competently block 
most attacks, but not reliably enough in my opinion.

Also; the main problem I have with 'firewall' devices such as the 
Billion is that they're often extremely basic; the firewall 
functionality is as simple as the fact it's doing NAT, and you can't 
contact a host with a private IP by normal means.  Due to the fact the 
software remains basically static (ROM versus hard drive), after the 
vendor stops caring about the product and stops releasing firmware 
updates, it's very possible holes in the device's TCP stack / NAT / web 
interface / etc could be discovered which may prove very interesting to 
patch; and even arguably while they do support it, especially in the 
case of the vendor writing their own software.  I always feel a hell of 
a lot safer with a nicely configured Linux/BSD firewall in place, 
personally.
