<H1>OT: Agile Broadband Demand Register</H1>

Hi folks,

Since broadband seems to be pretty relevant to many (most?) Linux folk, and
since we're trying to find ways to create more broadband options for people
who want it, I just want to point out the existence of a broadband database
register that we have just created, with an aim of understanding who, and
where, people would like broadband services to exist.

This applies to people inside ADSL 'coverage' areas who cannot get ADSL
today, and also applies to people outside of ADSL coverage areas (because
our broadband solutions aren't limited to wired DSL).

The register is here:

<A HREF="http://www.agile.com.au/demand">http://www.agile.com.au/demand</A>

If you want broadband and you can't currently get it, please, take a minute
to fill in the blanks, and help us to help you.

Background: 

There is an FAQ on the site noted above that will answer many of the most
obvious questions about this demand register, but just to also answer the
key questions here and now:

Agile (the sister company to Internode) is actively starting to deploy
non-Telstra broadband infrastructure, especially in SA. It is the first
company to have ever deployed a non-Telstra DSLAM facility in a township
that Telstra hasn't gotten around to servicing (Meningie in SA). In addition
we have deployed multiple 'wireless DSL' services in various spots in
regional SA already, with more intended in the future.

Over time, naturally, we've got various bits of email from interested folk
saying 'if you ever make a broadband local loop system at &lt;location x&gt;, I'd
love to use it', or 'Will you put one in here?' etc etc. The difficulty with
that sort of expression of interest is in aggregating them to form a
rational picture of the places in which an economic case exists to solve the
problem.

So, the aim of the Agile demand register is to let us properly understand,
and assess, demand in various geographic areas - so we can, we hope, create
systems to service that demand. We think that this is in everyones'
interest. Its all entirely obligation free stuff.

Folk who may have sent someone at Agile or Internode email on this sort of
topic in the past (many of you are on this list, which is why I'm posting
this here) are hereby requested to fill in the register as well. Indeed you
are the folk that we most want and need to do that.

Thanks, and I sincerely hope that this mechanism helps us to make some more
folk (especially but not only) in SA happy in the future, by helping us to
mount the economic case to create more broadband services in places where
Telstra or others haven't yet seen fit to do so.

Its a real case of 'the more the merrier' - i.e. Please, do tell your
friends.

Regards,
  Simon Hackett
