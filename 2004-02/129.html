&gt; Well, for a start, calm down - no dramas here...

Let me guess: The use of uppercase?  If so, I thought that is the standard, 
I'll be sure to use lowercase (unless I actually am flustered) from now on. 
:-)

&gt; &gt; rpm -U --nosignature pan-0.14.2-1.src.rpm  instead & is that likely to
&gt; &gt; generate other grief?
&gt;
&gt; First off, do you realise that you're upgrading a source rpm (rather than
&gt; a binary rpm that may look very similar to pan-0.14.2-1.i386.rpm)?

Yes, chose it on purpose, figured it was best to let the system make the 
binary to suit itself.

&gt; Source rpms need to be built and normally you rpm -i the source rpm and
&gt; then go into the /usr/src/redhat (or whatever - let me know if you need
&gt; more assistance with this).

Built?  As in rpmbuild? I thought that was for creating rpm files.  As Pan 
is already installed (comes on installation disks - RH 7.something up I 
think), logical assumption is to upgrade, at least that's how I understand 
the process to work.

&gt; Honestly, it looks to me like you've picked up a source rpm instead of a
&gt; binary rpm.  Perhaps try the binary if all you're wanting to do is
&gt; upgrade the package.  If that isn't what you want to do, we can go
&gt; through the rpmbuild stuff.  Perhaps let us know which distribution you
&gt; are using as well.

Oh!  I _do_ have to use rpmbuild, I was guessing/hoping that rpm would 
compile & install on the fly, guess not.  :-(  Btw this system is RH9.0

As you can probably guess I haven't tried installing a source rpm before, 
I've dealt with tarballs but, they merely extract the source & then you run 
configure and/or make. One of the problems I find with such versatile OS's 
as Linux is sometimes the choice is too big (ie. the following is what I 
had to choose from for RH-9 alone):

pan-0.14.2-1.athlon.rpm        01-Sep-2003 13:27   1.0M  
pan-0.14.2-1.i386.rpm          01-Sep-2003 13:29   1.0M  
pan-0.14.2-1.i586.rpm          01-Sep-2003 13:30   1.0M  
pan-0.14.2-1.i686.rpm          01-Sep-2003 13:31   1.0M  
pan-0.14.2-1.src.rpm           01-Sep-2003 13:34   1.8M  
pan-0.14.2-nospell1.athlon.rpm 01-Sep-2003 13:35   1.0M  
pan-0.14.2-nospell1.i386.rpm   01-Sep-2003 13:36   1.0M  
pan-0.14.2-nospell1.i586.rpm   01-Sep-2003 13:38   1.0M  
pan-0.14.2-nospell1.i686.rpm   01-Sep-2003 13:39   1.0M  
pan-0.14.2-nospell1.src.rpm    01-Sep-2003 13:42   1.8M  
(Each of these had an icon, which was translated to [SND], in front of it - 
hopefully that was just for a tone as you clicked on it)

There were also a couple of directories which I didn't bother looking in, 
probably should have.

If I'm honest with myself (& I like to believe I am), I'm basically a 
dabbler, half the time I suspect I get things working by accident more than 
anything else. Eg. In the last incarnation the sound actually worked on 
this thing, now it doesn't, why, don't know, maybe I'll get it working 
again oneday. &lt;shrug!&gt;

Back to Pan. I plan on installing the source, if it works cool, if not, try 
one of the binaries (unless I've "blown" something up!). :-)

Thanks for the help, if you think there's something I should know, by all 
means tell me. The less grief I cause myself at the start, the less I have 
to try & repair. :-)
