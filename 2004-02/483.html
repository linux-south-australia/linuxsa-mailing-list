Hi all
To ans your question on why I not ask on Lindows forum,
I HAVE.
And am still awaiting a repliy
And no the vertion I have hasa only half the driver. This is my Prob.
Now I would compile the drivers. If only I had a development enviro
installed and configured.
kinda a waist to spend a weekend d-loading the kerel source and the thing
not working.:-{
you see My current modem connects at a wopping 28.8K and sometimes I get
45.6K with a d-load rate of
1.2KB/S 30MB @ 1.2K you looking at the entier weekend gone.
I have built these drivers befor (Meny Meny times.)
I asked you guys for help because I have NO way of builing the divers
myself!
As fare as I know as long as you can build with kernel headers of the
current kernel
the moduals sould load. Is this not correct?
I am not a compleat novice in linux beeen working(playing) in linux since
Redhat 5 (when I was still at school)
All the cool peaple were at that stage using Slackware 4.something. But
Modems have always been a prob
So I have always had to have a windows box for games and the internet. :-{
Anyway comming back to the SMlink Modem the thing works finish under linux
(Mandrake Slackware Fedora
hell even Freebsb works)
But from the probs getting thge Digital camera working me no like USB too
finicky.

Thanks
Adrian.

&gt; &gt;why don't you ask on the Lindow's forums.
&gt; &gt;https://forum.lindows.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?Cat=&C=7
&gt; &gt;The people there are very helpful and someone may well have already
&gt; &gt;done this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Patrick
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I have  sent him the tar ball of drivers he was after.
&gt; Hopefully he can work it out from there .. (I think he can).
&gt; Hmm I guess we are going to get more Lindows level people asking stuff..
&gt; Adrian seemed familiar with Mandrake so ..he is not a total novice.
&gt;
&gt; I'm certainly not going to install Lindows just so I am familiar with
&gt; it.. Actually been there and done that.. It lasted 2 days :)
&gt; You can turn it into Debian reasonably easily ..(just install debian
&gt; it's easier)
&gt;
&gt;  Of course the real problem here (eventuallly) is
&gt; Manufacturers not releasing their source code .. can hardly blame
&gt; Lindows for that.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Hi all
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;This might be a kinda silly question, but I'v been sitting with this
&gt; &gt;issue &gt;for a week now and no joy :-{
&gt; &gt;&gt;Here is my troubles you see I do 90% of my work on the net (purchace
&gt; &gt;&gt;orders that type of thing) anyway
&gt; &gt;&gt;I installed Lindows OS 4.5 and the install went OK the prob is that it
&gt; &gt;not &gt;load the correct moduel for the modem :-{
&gt; &gt;&gt;My question to you all is will any one have the 2.4.23 kernel source
&gt; &gt;and &gt;is willing to build the moduels for me?
&gt; &gt;&gt;If and this is one very big IF anyone will you can d-load the driver
&gt; &gt;&gt;source from &lt;<A HREF="http://www.smlink.com&gt">http://www.smlink.com&gt</A>;www.smlink.com and e-mail me
&gt; &gt;&gt;the compiled drivers, slmodem ans slusb to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;mailto:<A HREF="mailto:grader@webmail.co.za">grader@webmail.co.za</A>&gt;<A HREF="mailto:grader@webmail.co.za">grader@webmail.co.za</A> . The reason that I
&gt; &gt;am &gt;unable to do this my self is that I do
&gt; &gt;&gt;not have the kernel source and further more I have no development
&gt; &gt;enviro. &gt;I understand that this is not a normal request but
&gt; &gt;&gt;I kinda need this. :-}
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Thanks
