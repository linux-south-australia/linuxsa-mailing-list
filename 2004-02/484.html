Dont forget this one :

'Dear Customer,

Congratulations on your move towards a modern WindowsXP Pro
infrastructure. The staff and management of &lt;insert your company name
here&gt; is pleased to announce our full support for this exciting new
development.

In order to properly capitalize on these progressive new developments,
&lt;insert your company name here&gt; is thrilled to announce our new level of
service agreement, which is specifically tailored to meet your growing
demands.

Our new charge rates are : &lt;insert current rate * 200%&gt;, which will
cover the expected inconvenience \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b TCO benefits of the
additional workload and support requirements that this is expected to
create.

In addition to this, we are pleased to supply an additional 2-3 MSCE
qualified support staff, which will be required for the support of each
individual Windows server that you are installing. These new staff
members will also need to be equipped with the latest mobile phone
devices so as to provide 24x7 support - a must have item once you move
your critical data onto the fantastic Windows server platforms. It is
also expected that you provide on-site housing, living quarters, private
showers and bathrooms, meal and lesuire activities for these new staff
members, since they are going to be spending an awful lot of time on
site to keep this system running. We are more than happy to provide
additional catering and entertainment staff for this venture through our
new subsidiary company.

It is also important to start this new venture with the right anti-virus
strategy. For this purpose, we will be able to provide an additional
MSCE qualified staff member (at our new low-cost rates), to be allocated
to each and every desktop machine that you operate. These additional
staff will sit with each user of the system on a full time basis, and
take control of the machine, for example whenever a new email arrives,
or IE decides to launch an unsolicited popup screen, to ensure that a
virus does not affect the system, and subsequently take out the entire
network via a sustained attack.

At the end of each working day, it is now essential to scan each
machine, and possibly re-install the whole operating system to ensure
that your users can start the next day's work with a guaranteed clean
slate. For this purpose, we will provide an additional set of MSCE
qualified staff members, rostered on night shift, to perform this vital
action.

As director of &lt;your company name here&gt;, I am especially thrilled about
this new move. On an un-related note, I will probably be scaling back my
own personal involvement on this site, since I can now afford to retire
to a nice quiet country acerage, and dedicate my time to fishing, golf,
family and friends, catching up on a huge backlog of reading, and
finally getting the time and resources to finish off a bunch of
pet-project software developments for alternate platforms.

Signed
&lt;your name here&gt;
'

If that is too harsh, I recommend that you stick your proposal online
somewhere, soon, so that interested parties can review it, and add their
2c worth.


Also, being the political move that this is, you might have to play
dirty. Whoever has dreamed up this sick idea of replacing G5's with
Windows is not likely to listen to any hard evidence. Such people are
beyond help, and wont listen to any reason. 

Its similar to trying to rationalise with an alcoholic, who has got
comfy at the bar, and has decided that opening a new bottle of scotch is
a really good idea before they drive home. You can try and talk sense to
them, or you can just leave them to it, and hope they dont run over
someone's kid on the way home. 

You are going to have to dig deeper into the corporate structure and
find where the decisions are really made, and find a sponsor for your
idea. This takes time, and you may be coming in at the end of a very
long process.

Perhaps an online petition with international signatures would get the
attention of Optus management and shareholders ?

&gt; Hello again all,
&gt;  
&gt; The following is a draft of a proposal I'm putting together to attempt
&gt; to sway Optus (my present employer) from abandoning its current tech
&gt; infrastructure of Macintosh G3 and G4's - in favour of Microsoft
&gt; Windows XP-Pro...  My hope is that if an argument can be shown that
&gt; appeals to Optus in a way the major decision makers can't argue with,
&gt; that Optus as a body Corporate, as well as it's Employees and it's
&gt; Customers (not to mention the Linux Community) can all walk away clear
&gt; winners by pushing Optus into the Linux camp.
&gt;  
&gt; Since I know so little and have such little experience in Linux - I
&gt; would like to throw this rough draft out to this User Group and beg
&gt; for EVERYONE'S help in presenting the best argument that can be made
&gt; so that I can take these facts/arguments and (hopefully) prevent Optus
&gt; from a mistake that would have YEARS of consequences. (Optus has stuck
&gt; with its current Mac platform since its inception - and while it's
&gt; better - imho - than Windows, I can't beleive it'd hold a candle to
&gt; Linux)
&gt;  
&gt; No help to bg or small, oh and this IS rather urgent as I have to have
&gt; the draft completed by next week - Friday 20th - so it can be
&gt; presented to one of the big wig decision makers who's scheduled to
&gt; come down towards the end of this month (For obvious security
&gt; reasons it would be wrong to say either who or when)
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks in advance for any/all help!!!
&gt; David WOLVERTON
&gt;  
&gt; -----------------------------
&gt; (Potential argument illustrations) Virus's/Backdoors/Trojan's on
&gt; Windows systems.  Can Optus afford to shut its entire Network down to
&gt; clean out Viruss on a regular basis?  Can it afford to have it's
&gt; entire Server Network shut down EACH time a patch is realeased? 
&gt; (I'm aware of three patches Microsoft released just this week!!!) 
&gt; Can Optus afford the backdoor security risks that Microsoft engineers
&gt; into every copy of its Operating System?  Can Optus afford the extra
&gt; IT staff that will have to be hired to cope with the extra demand of
&gt; patching/fixing CONSTANTLY crashing Windows?  (Even Mac's are FAR more
&gt; stable/reliable than Windows)  Can Optus afford it's entire E-Mail
&gt; network to be constantly down to clean out Trojan's like My Doom? 
&gt; Considering the size of Optus, the Company will save TENS (plus) of
&gt; thousands off of its initial purchase price if it purchases Linux,
&gt; because the Linux supplied Operating System is a mere fraction of the
&gt; cost of Windows XP. It will also save itself further TENS (plus) of
&gt; thousands because software created to run on it will NOT require
&gt; individual licences for each user.  PLUS less RAM will be required to
&gt; run each individual work station saving FURTHER tens of thousands. 
&gt; (Not only that but each system will be able to run more - and crash
&gt; less.)  Maintaining the system(s) will cost less because Linux is more
&gt; stable/reliable - and patches will not require a reboot of the entire
&gt; Network.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; (Examples of successful Linux use by major Organisations)
&gt;  
&gt; (A) Linux is being used, by NASA, to operate the Mars Rover  (In
&gt; fact, a large percentage of NASA hardware is run by Linux)
&gt; (B) Amazon.com Inc. (The worlds largest E-Tailer) began
&gt; deploying Linux in 2000... Now, Linux runs its entire infrastructure.
&gt; (C) Sun and Novell have BOTH publicly announced that the only software
&gt; they will support (besides their own) is Linux
&gt; (D) Linux is the basis of the world wide web. (Almost all Web Servers
&gt; are Apache software running on Linux machines)
&gt; (E) It is a well known fact that Linux is being used (right now) by
&gt; more data centers than any other O/S
&gt; (F) Telstra announced its Linux desktop project, Project Firefly, last
&gt; year.  When the trial is complete, later this year, the system is
&gt; expected to roll out rapidly - with the ownership reduction expected
&gt; to be approximatly 40 per cent.
&gt; (G) THE NSW Roads and Traffic Authority is about to embark on what may
&gt; be the biggest roll-out of a desktop open source system in NSW. The
&gt; department
&gt; is in the final stages of assessing a project that would result in the
&gt; Sun Microsystems open source StarOffice productivity suite being
&gt; deployed on the desktops of 1500 front-counter staff.
&gt; (H) The German finance ministry announced that it has now installed
&gt; two large IBM mainframe computers that run Linux.
&gt; (I) Sun Microsystems has already taken advantage of the Government's
&gt; desire for open source, signing a four-year whole-of-government
&gt; common-use contract in October. The contract includes Sun's Java
&gt; system and StarOffice productivity suite.
&gt; (J) The German government has also decided to install Linux in other
&gt; departments, including 11,000 police computers that are to be switched
&gt; from Microsoft Windows this year in the state of Lower Saxony.
&gt;  
&gt; ----------------------------
&gt; **So... IF ANYONE CAN THINK OF ANYTHING TO ADD/TAKE AWAY THAT WILL
&gt; ASSIST SWAYING OPTUS AWAY FROM GOING MICROSOFT XP-PRO - MAKING LIFE
&gt; EASIER FOR ITSELF, ITS EMPLOYEES/CUSTOMERS... AS WELL AS FURTHERING
&gt; THE CAUSE OF LINUX IN GENERAL - PLEASE HELP!!!
