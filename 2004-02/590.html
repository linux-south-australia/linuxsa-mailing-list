&gt; I agree with Frank :)
&gt; Jan 2003, I got so pissed with TV. The kids would argue over what to watch 
...

My family's TV broke when I was around 6 or 7.  It got replaced 5 years
later when my dad needed a video player to do some translations for SBS.
Not having a TV was almost like a 'golden era' for me.  My sister now
uses the TV as a background while doing craft-y things but I tend to
either watch fully or not at all.  Mostly not at all.

...
&gt; The TV is still in sis's bedroom. I don't miss it. I live in a 
&gt; 1-minute-news-bite vacuum and I don't care.

I will admit that I spend way too much of my time listening to Radio
National but at least in can be done at the same time as cooking,
housework, etc.

&gt; Now about this 'puter thingy which takes up so much of my time, which my 
&gt; wife says I am married to :&gt; ??

Point!  Not sure how to manage weaning myself off that.  Camping/hiking
is a good starting point for a sense of perspective.
