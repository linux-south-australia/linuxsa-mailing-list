I think it has a lot to do with Windows. I am not suggesting Linux or 
Mac OSX are perfect. That sort of attitude is asking for trouble. But I 
think they do leave users less vulnerable because they have made better 
design decisions.

There are faults in the SMTP protocol. Some of the significant problems 
can be improved upon with good management.

* All SMTP relays should be rejected unless from authenticated users
* SPF checking and advertising should be set up by all domains to reduce 
spoofing
* Since Windows is very susceptable to viruses, it is good practice to 
reject all windows executable attachments. This is a long list for 
Windows :-(
* Spamassassin can be used to reduce the amount on junk advertising and 
scam mails

As Kylie has just said in a post that came in while I was typing. A lot 
can be done to educate users. However you will still find the occasional 
pathalogical case who will not listen.
