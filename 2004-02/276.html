Oops I just hit reply for the last email sending it to 'Galadriel' only. 
  Better be more careful from now on.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I found your list via the main linuxSA web site.  I googled to get the 
&gt;&gt;website :)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Given your "new" status is there anything you can think of that LinuxSA can
&gt; do to help make itself more well known?

Apart from the below.  Well not much.  I guess some SA exposure would be 
good but not sure how exactly.  There's a site called SAcentral it's 
government based but maybe you could stick a link in there?  Posters in 
computer areas might work.  Berlin Wall, Universities, places like that?

The website could be improved I suppose but it does the job.  It's 
probably more about getting ppl to see it in the first place.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I have some free advice too.  Imagine that, advice from a newbie!  You 
&gt;&gt;say on the linuxSA website one of your goals is for promotion.  I can 
&gt;&gt;help with that, at least for newbies and probably for others as well. 
&gt;&gt;The main linux.org website has a groups section here;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;<A HREF="http://www.linux.org/groups/index.html">http://www.linux.org/groups/index.html</A>
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Your linuxSA site is not listed (under Australia).  Quite a few people 
&gt;&gt;refer to the address above and so I'm positive a listing would help.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well make one - in LinuxSA there is no King but in time and with patience
&gt; and in your own way you may become one of The Royals.

I you want me to care take of some of this it shouldn't be too hard but 
I'd need the website owner's permission first.

You've been reading flamewarriors too much lol.
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome 0-)
&gt; 
&gt; BTW Romana is involved in itshareSA (<A HREF="http://cai-sa.linunix.com/">http://cai-sa.linunix.com/</A>) - itshare
&gt; can help you get Linux skills whilst at the same time helping the
&gt; disadvantaged, the lonely and poor.

Not too slow to plug are ya? :)  No sense letting the grass grow under 
one's feet I suppose.  I'll give it some thought but frankly me 
installing linux on systems will need a great deal more skill than I 
actually have, esp considering I don't even have it on my own yet.
&gt; 
Aaron
