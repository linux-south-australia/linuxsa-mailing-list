&gt; Quick question.
&gt; I've looked through the archives and looked at whirlpool and have
&gt; finally decided to get Netspace ADSL.
They are fine generally speaking. They are not so much local but from the
people I know using them they are very happy.

Another alternative is IINET they are good too again from anecdotal
evidence - mind you most of these people are reasonably tech savvy (sp?) and
as such dont have a great need for support. Typically any issues I have had
(with Internode) were not their fault but rather a global Telstra issue
which affects ALL dsl providers.

&gt; Before i take the plunge: any good reasons not to?
NO
&gt; Other contenders:
&gt; iinet - read they were bad on linuxsa
where?
&gt; big pond + optus - everyone says they are hopeless
Optus are very good we have them at work and the connection is fine.
&gt; internode - i use them for my business DSL, but have experienced poor
&gt; service with them (they don't answer support requests)
_HUH_ I would be surprised if that were the case and disappointed too. and I
am sure <A HREF="mailto:feedback@internode.on.net">feedback@internode.on.net</A> would want to know.
&gt; tgp - lot of people say they are bad on whirlpool
Forget it once the data gets on to their network your screwed they have a
history of going cheap particvularly with the lack of bandwidth
&gt; I couldn't find too much bad stuff written about Netspace and their data
&gt; caps seemed competetive/generous.
From what I know they are AS good as Internode is.

&gt;
&gt; I also like the fact that if all your friends are on Netspace too, you
&gt; can transfer data between them for free (i want to rsync stuff!).
that's a bonus. and I think Internode (in may case may well seek to do the
same)

&gt; couldn't tell if this was the case on other ISP's.
some offer it Internode dont.
&gt; Also they have
&gt; mirrors and free gaming networks. (The one thing they don't have is free
&gt; Internet radio).
Internodes mirrors are fine for Linux IMO but I listen to the radio in
preference to streaming it

Finally - I would suggest Internode but if you want volume data pick
Netspace or IINET as good and definately more data for the same buck.
