we at itshare/computerbank rely on donated hardware like this. Ian has
been EXTREMELY lucky to even get this much, as we very rarely get laptop
donations - these mainly came from victoria, and are missing hard
drives, power supplies, and are mainly 486 level.

we could definitely do with more - generally we only give to those with
a demonstarted need for a laptop as opposed to a desktop - and even
then, our lack of working laptops makes it difficult.

so, if anyone can suggest a way to source donated laptop sfor people
with real need, for example disabilities (blind people can use emacspeak, 
so x can be bypassed, etc), please let me know. 

while these people are usually incredibly grateful for anything they can get, 
we cant even donate fully functional units atm. :)

&gt; Hi David,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; with a CDROM?  that makes it much easier.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; NO &lt;sigh&gt; but I think it will take the Xircom PCMCIA network card so 
&gt; that should help.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; have you go into the compaq bios?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Cant see how to get into it. They say you hit F10 but they also rely on 
&gt; a Diagnostic partition hidden on the drive. This didn't come with a 
&gt; drive so I have downloaded all the support software for it. Still no 
&gt; luck.
&gt; 
&gt; At present I only get so far as the LEDs lighting up. Not a thing else 
&gt; takes place. No floppy access, no RAM count etc so as far as I have 
&gt; seen it isn't even getting into POST.
&gt; 
&gt;  Cheers,
&gt;  Ian
