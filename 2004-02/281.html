I'll chuck in my 2cents worth.

Friends have used Adam and generally they've been happy. I'm using 
Internode and overall I am very happy with them. I've always had prompt and 
helpful tech support, whether by email or voice. They even helped me set 
the 'net connection for my LAN. My latest incident was me, in an effort to 
fix a problem with LAN/net connectivity dying, 'configuring' my dsl-300 
beyond apparent repair. Internode replaced this unit with a 2nd hand 
working one, although mine would have been outside the 18mth support 
period. Fixed the same day I dropped it in! I have no hesitation 
recommending Internode, based of course on my personal experience.

I concur with others that the sales responses need to improve. I tried to 
get info for one of my clients, to get them connected via adsl. The 
response was too long and my client is now with Adam.

&gt;Quick question.
&gt;I've looked through the archives and looked at whirlpool and have finally 
&gt;decided to get Netspace ADSL.
&gt;
&gt;Before i take the plunge: any good reasons not to?
&gt;
&gt;Other contenders:
&gt;iinet - read they were bad on linuxsa
&gt;big pond + optus - everyone says they are hopeless
&gt;internode - i use them for my business DSL, but have experienced poor 
&gt;service with them (they don't answer support requests)
&gt;tgp - lot of people say they are bad on whirlpool
&gt;
&gt;I couldn't find too much bad stuff written about Netspace and their data 
&gt;caps seemed competetive/generous.
&gt;
&gt;I also like the fact that if all your friends are on Netspace too, you can 
&gt;transfer data between them for free (i want to rsync stuff!). I couldn't 
&gt;tell if this was the case on other ISP's. Also they have mirrors and free 
&gt;gaming networks. (The one thing they don't have is free Internet radio).
