&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Someone let these people down.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Bull!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; No really. Microsoft told all these people that they could have bigger
&gt; penises. These people believed them. We consider this stupid but the
&gt; media and a heap of 'experts' validated Microsoft and said that if
&gt; people didn't get a bigger penis, it wasn't Microsofts fault.

I agree that Microsoft's real strength is marketing.
&gt; 
&gt; People have different specialities when it comes to intelligence. Some
&gt; people are deficient in the areas we grasp easily. It is smarter to
&gt; recognise this than ignore it. Apple wanted to make the Macintosh as
&gt; easy to use as a bicycle and mostly succeeded. These people should have
&gt; been using Macs. The way Gnome is going (the right way IMO) it is going
&gt; to be just as good. We need a simple unambiguous interface and we need
&gt; to make decisions on behalf of these people that they are incapable of
&gt; making.

All those years ago my sole reason for rejecting the mac was that at the 
time the macs I used had software eject for the floppies.  I considered 
it a terrible idea at the time.  Still do actually.  Macs also had less 
flexibility in hardware and were too expensive.  Still are probably but 
I haven't looked at one in years although I've heard the hardware 
siutation has picked up.

Some clueless twerp got a virus onto that network (a different clueless 
twerp to me thankfully) and those disks stayed in those drives.
&gt; 
&gt; We have the CLI and we can run ratpoison, afterstep, blackbox, fvwm, E
&gt; etc if we want to escape. And we can su. But these people need a safe
&gt; friendly environment. The best we can hope for is that occasionally some 
&gt; of these users will wake up from the illusion we create for them and 
&gt; start to learn.

It's a matter of wanting to learn.  Just as many ppl refuse to learn 
science, maths, sociality or fixing cars.  Time is of the essence too, 
and more importantly that the time is well spent meaning a payback.
&gt; 
&gt; There are probably a percentage of these people we could get to while
&gt; they are still at school and get some geek values into them.
&gt; 
&gt; To do that we need a high school computing curriculum that values
&gt; research, programming and open source methodology. A computing
&gt; curriculum aimed at creating producers. At the moment the curriculum is
&gt; producing consumers.  They are reinforcing the lie that Micosoft has all
&gt; the answers, and they have opted to teach the use of applications
&gt; instead of fundamental concepts. Bright kids leave high school having
&gt; only ever used Microsoft products. And thinking that they know
&gt; everything there is to know about computers because they can create a
&gt; form in access and added a row of numbers in excel. We should show them 
&gt; the power of the cli, scripting languages and open source development 
&gt; while their minds are open.

I gotta say I'm largely on the same wavelength as you on all this.

Education is always the key but looking at the school system and the 
education outside school by courses, activities, family and tertiary 
studies doesn't give me a whole lotta hope.
