&gt; I think you have lost already.
&gt; These guys are obviously insane.
Hmmm...  The thought has crossed EVERYONE in the Centre's (that I've spoken
to) mind - but then again, when an Organisation makes BILLIONS of dollars of
profit, and don't want to single handedly support the Federal Government in
tax - one has to do SOMETHING big to justify a smaller tax bill, right?
(It's the ONLY reason for doing something like this that my collegues and I
can come up with to even partially justify the downgrade)

&gt; Or  have  internal communications blockages that
&gt; they are functionally so..
I think that also comes into play, though it disturbs me that the IT
Department SEEM (at least on the surface) to have dropped the ball so badly
on this one that it plainly stinks.

&gt; bet this is a "depreciation driven decision" and nothing
&gt; to do with real functionalities. (utility TCO, security
&gt; etal)
Not sure, because as a member of the Sales Team, I'm just not privy to info
such as this, muliplying the problem - I'm not in Sydney or Asia (where the
REAL decisions are made seeing as Singapore Telecom own Optus now) so I'm
just not in a position to KNOW anything...

&gt; Start by suggesting that the Head Office Office
&gt; Admin, Accounting, Procurement and Costings
&gt; department switch over on a Costed trail / trial
&gt; basis ..(to XP) You can always recycle the
&gt; hardware that way. :)
Not a bad idea.  :-)

&gt;  That way the rest of you can keep working.
That's part of the problem that prompted the downgrade...  Our equipment
is... well... tired.  The monitors are almost all worn out, the mice are
trackballs for everyone except upper management, the systems run slow, the
servers are constantly crashing, clogging (You wouldn't believe all the
E-Mail's we get about major systems down/being rebuilt or whatever) and the
list just goes on and on...  (As a minimum, to keep our existing
infrastructure they'd have to replace about 90odd percent of our monitors
and mice as well as upgrading RAM in each box - not to mention
replacing/updating our Servers + purchasing more licences.)  And I'm
guessing that when they sat down and recognised that, they figgured it was
simply better to pull the plug and start over...  Now how the decision was
made to go Windows I'll probably never know - but I'd like to at least TRY
to have that repealed before it's too late!!!  (I still think that my
suggestion works the best short and long term by simply updaing OS's/RAM and
montors/mice/Server and etc)

But - saving that - my feeling is that if they've made their minds up to
replace rather than revamp - let's at least get their minds changed about
Windows!!!

&gt; Point them to _Sun_ or IBM before they go broke :)
&gt; Better still get in touch with Leon Brooks &lt;<A HREF="mailto:leon@cyberknights.com.au">leon@cyberknights.com.au</A>&gt;.
I don't recognise this persons name (sorry if you're on the list and I've
inadvertantly offended)  Who is Leon?

&gt; Or Mr Bennet or Mr Hacket or Ryan and David ...
&gt; Kim etc
These names at least I recognise...  Surely they'll respond after they've
read the posts?

&gt; Have you tried tracking down the people doing the
&gt; gig at NSW Dept.Motor Transport ..? (There are
&gt; a few other department in NSW moving or moved
&gt; as well --some only as far as Sun and Staroffice ++ )
No, Didn't think to to be honest...  Not sure I have the authority to do so
to be honest.  After all, I'm not management - and I only work in Sales.
That said, I certainly am open to hear how that can help WITHOUT my getting
my butt dragged through the fire in doing so?

&gt; I should just forward your original post to the
&gt; AULinux list ..  May I ?
Absaloutly.  That was the whole reason I threw this into the Group - to get
enough help to give Optus the best chance possible.  I'm not stupid enough
to think I can have even a CHANCE of this without some signifgant help!!!

&gt; You need to have a good understanding of what
&gt; drove the original, apparently retrograde decision
&gt; in the first place.. and blanket that with a "FLOSS"
&gt; solution.
Hmmm...  I'm not sure I'm in a position to be able to find this out to be
honest.  I can have a yack with our IT Dept here in Adelaide - but seeing as
they're not actually Optus employees - I'm not sure how far theat'll get me.

David
