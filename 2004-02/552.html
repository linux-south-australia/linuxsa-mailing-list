&gt; To me this is about the one-way commercial crap that is TV.  I find it
&gt; difficult to tolerate much television.  Truly the boredom of it slowly
&gt; spoon-feeding you crap is enough to make me want to scream.  I don't
&gt; really understand why so many ppl can stare at it all day watching this.

Oooh, I feel some Frank Zappa coming on ...

"I am gross and perverted, I'm obsessed 'n deranged
 I have existed for years but very little had changed
 I am the tool of the government, and industry too
 For I am destined to rule and regulate you

 I may be vile and pernicious but you can't look away
 I make you think I'm delicious with the stuff that I say
 I am the best you can get. Have you guessed me yet'?
 I am the slime oozin' out from your tv set

 You will obey me while I lead you 
 And eat the garbage that I feed you
 Until the day that we don't need you
 Don't got for help...no one will heed you

 Your mind is totally controlled, it has been stuffed into my mold
 And you will do as you are told until the rights to you are sold

 That's right, folks..  Don't touch that dial!"

(and queue blazing guitar solo ...)

If that's how he felt in '73, he must be generating Gigajoules
of RPM in his grave now ...

&lt;rest of diatribe snipped in agreement&gt;
