&gt;Oooh, I feel some Frank Zappa coming on ...

I agree with Frank :)
Jan 2003, I got so pissed with TV. The kids would argue over what to watch 
and the lead up to the latest war we just had to have, with "smart" bombs 
and all was close to inducing me to punch out da TV. I think I woould have 
lost.

So I packed it up. Took the video, the lot and shoved it in the spare room. 
It lasted 2 weeks - my sis in law (& her hubby overseas student) live with 
us. She suffered to much so the TV migrated to her room :) Okay, the kids 
get to watch a few videos - if aunty lets them in &lt;evil grin&gt;

The kids started to play again - make up games, dress up - SHARE - inside a 
few days. My 6yo took to reading up to 14 books a week. We actually had to 
take books from her.

If you love your kids - kill the TV. Shoot it. Damage it beyond repair. 
Send it to a third world country where everyone in a village will stop all 
human communication and forget to make love, thus thus ending the 
population crisis (don't flame me, its TIC!).

The TV is still in sis's bedroom. I don't miss it. I live in a 
1-minute-news-bite vacuum and I don't care.

Now about this 'puter thingy which takes up so much of my time, which my 
wife says I am married to :&gt; ??
