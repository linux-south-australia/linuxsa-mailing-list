&gt; Yep, you have a valid point. We set these people up to fail by
&gt; installing an operating system that we know is prone to abuse

It's got nothing to do with Windows or Linux, and to think that
only Windows can be infected by a virus is to let down your guard.
Macintosh users used to be plagued by virii, perhaps they even still are.
The problem is that users do really stupid things with their computer
and then act surprised by the nasty results.  Okay, everyone can make
a mistake, and if you do it once it is only a mistake.  If you do it
twice it's carelessness, and if you do it three times it's a habit.
I don't care to keep helping people who are habitually stupid with their
computers, and that, I think, was the point of the original article.
