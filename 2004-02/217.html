&gt; I also like the fact that if all your friends are on Netspace too, you

&gt; mirrors and free gaming networks. (The one thing they don't have is 
&gt; free Internet radio).

We're on Netspace at work and quite frankly we're not terribly 
impressed; customer service is average, and the link seems to go up the 
creek randomly.  Also, if you're late paying, they cut you off 
completely (on that exact day); it's happened a few times as the boss 
has overlooked things.  Not the best thing for productivity.

I'd recommend Internode for this scenario.  Indeed, I've also heard a 
lot of people say that the support has gone down the drain, which is a 
shame - they're a great company.  :-(

Of course, if you want unlimited, you can always try Adelaide-based 
comindico-reseller Sirion (www.sirion.net.au).
