run arp -a on a machine that lost a connection. If you see an IP address that has 2 mac addresses attached to it, you have two machines with the same ip.

Hope this helps

&gt; &gt; They couldn't reconfigure my DSL-300 so replaced it. I'm back on line!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, I'm still getting drop outs. Connectivity to the server dies.
&gt; &gt; Internet access stops, SSH, Samba, HTTP, the lot BUT, not necessarily
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; all PCs on the LAN (3) at once. Occasionally one will stop and another
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; okay. Drop outs are more frequent now (see below) and may sustain for
&gt; 20 min.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, for starters, if you're losing connectivity to services on the server,
&gt; you probably won't need to fiddle with your DSL modem (provided that I'm
&gt; understanding your network topology correctly).
&gt; 
&gt; Check /var/log/messages (or wherever: if they're not kept there, you can
&gt; usually backtrack to where they're being stored by pointers within /etc/syslog.conf,
&gt; provided it's using syslog - damn variations) for unusual messages (apart
&gt; from the packet messages).
&gt; 
&gt; If you have console access to the firewall, run "tcpdump -eni &lt;blah&gt; icmp"
&gt; (where &lt;blah&gt; is the network name of your internal interface).  The next
&gt; time the problem occurs, ping from both working and non-working PCs
&gt; and observe (and/or post) the results.
&gt; 
&gt; My gut feeling (on scanty-to-none evidence) is that you *may* have another
&gt; machine on the network popping up with the same internal IP address as
&gt; the firewall's.  Are you using a hub or switch on your internal network?
&gt; (a "tcpdump -eni &lt;blah&gt; arp" would be handy here too).

&gt; &gt; &gt;I think there might be a firewall issue. Ie all traffic from the loc
&gt; zone
&gt; &gt; &gt;to fw (local zone to firewall in Shorewall speak) seems to stop.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, if traffic to Samba and sshd is stopping, I'd expect those services
&gt; to be running on an "internal" zone.  But that might be something I don't
&gt; grok about Shorewall.
