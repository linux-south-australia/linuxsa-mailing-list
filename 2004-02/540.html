&gt;Hey all,
&gt;
&gt;Thought I'd throw some thought-provoking questions onto the intellectual 
&gt;fire that is this mailing list.
&gt;
&gt;Following along from television series' such as Big Brother and Survivor, 
&gt;television stations seem to have jumped at the idea and introduced 
&gt;numerous new series' based on the reality television concept. Some people 
&gt;may say that it is going too far. Some, such as my high-school headmaster, 
&gt;go as far to say that the concept is evil and is contributing to the 
&gt;demise of human society. Others will just follow the crowd like the sheep 
&gt;that they are, and like and accept what the media dictates them to like 
&gt;and accept.
&gt;
&gt;Was Australian Idol and the other Idol series' different to the Big 
&gt;Brother style of reality television? Does the fact that they have to be 
&gt;good at what they do to win the competition rather than to simply be 
&gt;accepted by the other "characters" on the television show make any difference?
&gt;
&gt;Is it going too far? Do we really care what these people think and do? Do 
&gt;we want to watch humans fall to such low standards as they turn against 
&gt;each other to succeed at whatever it is they are supposed to be succeeding at?
&gt;
&gt;Is there anything else that anyone wants to bring up? What are your own 
&gt;thoughts on reality television?
&gt;
&gt;I look forward to reading your responses, and to partaking in the 
&gt;discussion that follows.
&gt;
&gt;- Adam
