Corey [bubs],

&gt; Nice generalisation you got there. As a matter of fact, I'm not a cop (I'm
&gt; in intel) but thanks for noticing. 

So you've missapproriated a police name? That's good. I hope that this
doesn't entail the same penalties as misapproriating a police uniform!

&gt;  I'm lso allowed to hate certain books  and both LoTR and Wuthering
&gt;  Heights fall under that banner for me. If you don't like it, well,
&gt;  don't be surprised if I couldn't care less.

If you don't care less - let me put it the most eloquent way I can - say
nothing at all about it. You obviously care a little more than less...

&gt; Your generalisations and snide inferences makes about as much sense as if
&gt; I inferred that because you have an email address that resembles yours at
&gt; Flinders Uni (and that I went to Adelaide Uni) that you must be a
&gt; dumbarse.

ROFL

If you think that you have the proof then why don't you actually call me a
dumbarse [sic] (I think you mean dumb arse - i.e. an arse that does not
speak) out in the open?

THEY HATES US, YES THEY HATES US; THOSE FILTHY HOBITTSES!\
