&gt; And seriously: We don't (ever) claim perfection, but we do continue to
&gt; strive for it. 

I have been an Internode customer for many years both professionally and
at home.   Simon is correct, Internode are not yet perfect.

There is an effect of being used to a very good level of service and
performance.   I get used to things working and when they don't, getting
fixed promptly.  On the rare occations this does not happen, I notice.

BUT!  Then I also help out family and friends who have chosen other
services.   Eg. A friend who went out and got Bigpong.   This friend
then had some problems...   Calls me :-)  ...   after many calls to
Bigpong and much frustration talking to support who think I am a moron
because I'm telling them the specific problem (I mean... how would a
customer know ;-)...  the problem is sorted a week later.

Repeat above scenario for dial up, ADSL and commercial customers I deal
with; the you realise Internode are a schmick operation compared with
the other providers, and even more so than the big Telco's.

I can cite many examples, the commerical ones have to remain
confidential.  There is some really bad service being provided [not
provided?] by other ISP's out there.  Once you deal with a range of
providers you can make your own judgement.   I appreciate Internode
performance and service much more after actually dealing with other
providers.

BTW: The friend has now 'churned' to Internode and is very happy. (Wow
Internode give you additional free Email accounts etc.).

Like Simon says...  If you have a real problem, YELL, Internode will
listen.

Regards, Kym
