&gt;From the wreckage of two broken laptops I now have the Toshiba 400CDT 
&gt;working nicely. 24 Mb RAM, 6 G hard drive, P75 CPU.
&gt;
&gt;The Floppy drive and CD drive are interchangeable which means that I 
&gt;can either have the Cd OR the floppy. The CD drive cant boot.
&gt;
&gt;How the heck can I install Linux onto the laptop?

One way might be :::
You build the debian boot floppies (pick the latest set you have on a cd
some where) .. On another machine.
Or download the new installer which MAY work a lot better (haven't tried
it yet)

man dd

for disks 1 to 4 something  not unlike but not  this:
dd if=/cdrom///bf.24/disk1  of=/dev/fd0 bs=1024 sync

This from my memory only

Use the (4) floppies to :::
Repartition to taste.
(a 10 to 20 meg part from sector "0" is useful for /boot)

Format to ext3 (lappy and room enough)
Install to a base system..   ONLY.
Keep the pcmia modules. (later)

About here you are asked to reboot do so.
Set up hostname. guest user or somesuch,  answer 5 to the exim question
..this is traditional:) now you can use apt-cdrom or apt-setup or hand
edit/etc/apt/sources.list

hint: you can get a second terminal most of the time on F2.
Where you can mount stuff.

Change to CDROM or network and install
_only the things you need._

That RAM proc speed probably not good for any desktop environment.
[removed possible flame war about how to minimal mem gnome  ]
Try XFCE ..

 Remember  apt / dpkg will take care
of dependencies you can migrate up to latest stuff after you have tested
etc etc.

OR stick with consol plus minmal window manager and learn Xemacs :)
If you can get OpenOffice to fly on that let me know :)
&gt; &lt;snipped&gt;
&gt;booting nicely on a Tom's Root Boot 1.0.3 floppy. 

Then what else do you need :) ?

&gt;I have had 
&gt;the hard drive out into another's laptop and tried to install Morphix 
&gt;Light GUI 0.4 on it. I finally found the 'Install on HD' instructions 
&gt;and followed them carefully. That didn't work which is a big pity 
&gt;because that is the kind of low spec distro I will need to use.
&gt;
&gt;So far the drive has got three partitions on it and has been formatted.
&gt;
&gt;As part of my CSDN role I have almost every distro available so getting
&gt; to a distro isn't a problem. If I cant boot from the CD how the hell
&gt; do 
&gt;I get a system on it?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Ian
