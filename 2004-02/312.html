Re: OT SMS to Optus mobile from email?Another option would be to get a Nokia
handset and data cable, attach it to your Linux box and run gnokii.  Gnokii
can send and receive SMS messages using an attached mobile phone, and it
wouldn't be too hard to write a little bit of Perl or shell script to grab
the email message and pipe it through gnokii and have it sent as SMS.
Advantage with this approach are that it doesn't require an active internet
connection, and you're not dependent on third party gateways (which can be
important for things like network monitoring).  Disadvantage is obviousl the
cost of running a second mobile phone just for SMS'ing.

Also the Internode Email to SMS gateway might be worth a look if you don't
want to roll your own, or be bothered with ICQ stuff...

service in the past and found it pretty good.

&gt; Another option (if you can figgure out a way to make the following
programme
&gt; run on your Linux distro) is to install the ICQ programme ( www.icq.com )
&gt; and send all SMS messages to phones on any network (Optus, Telstra, Voda
and
&gt; Etc) anywhere in Australia, absaloutly ***FREE***.  (ICQ allows you to
send
&gt; ICQ's, E-Mail's and SMS's directly from your desktop.)
&gt;
&gt; My thinking is that IF you can figgure out how to port the programme to
your
&gt; Linux distro then you'll escape the cost of sending E-Mail's...
&gt; (Particularly usefull if you're going to be sending a few on a regular
&gt; basis.)  Now... That said, it's only 160 charrachters you can send in each
&gt; ICQ - so after writing your E-Mail, you'll have to cut and paste it into
&gt; ALOT of seperate ICQ's.  Consequently, I guess it just depends on whether
a
&gt; free method that takes time is better (to you) than a pay per each use
&gt; method that is quick...
&gt;
&gt; If you have no way of installing ICQ onto your system and can't afford
&gt; whatever programme the list can suggest to make it work - you're also in
&gt; luck if you own any of the following handheld platforms that you can
connect
&gt; to your Linux box in some way, because the following handheld formats have
&gt; ICQ versions ready to go for immediate install...  They include: Palm
m515,
&gt; m500, 505; Visor Handspring, Sony Clie, Compaq iPaq, Casio Cassiopeia or a
&gt; HP Jornada 568.
Just install centericq, then you can use the line:
echo "send this message" | centericq -s sms -n 12345678
works and can be scripted. Another alternative is using sms_client, but
it costs a phone call and requires a modem.
