&gt;&gt; These guys are obviously insane.
&gt;Hmmm...  The thought has crossed EVERYONE in the Centre's (that I've
&gt;spoken to) mind - but then again, when an Organisation makes BILLIONS
&gt;of dollars of profit, and don't want to single handedly support the
&gt;Federal Government in tax - one has to do SOMETHING big to justify a
&gt;smaller tax bill, right?(It's the ONLY reason for doing something like
&gt;this that my collegues and I can come up with to even partially justify
&gt;the downgrade)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Or  have  internal communications blockages that
&gt;&gt; they are functionally so..
&gt;I think that also comes into play, though it disturbs me that the IT
&gt;Department SEEM (at least on the surface) to have dropped the ball so
&gt;badly on this one that it plainly stinks.

Perhaps your friends in the local IT department have some observations ?

&gt;
&gt;&gt; bet this is a "depreciation driven decision" and nothing
&gt;&gt; to do with real functionalities. (utility TCO, security
&gt;&gt; etal)
&gt;Not sure, because as a member of the Sales Team, I'm just not privy to
&gt;info such as this, muliplying the problem - I'm not in Sydney or Asia
&gt;(where the REAL decisions are made seeing as Singapore Telecom own
&gt;Optus now) so I'm just not in a position to KNOW anything...

You mean the Singapore Gov't :)
[lets not go there]
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Start by suggesting that the Head Office Office
&gt;&gt; Admin, Accounting, Procurement and Costings
&gt;&gt; department switch over on a Costed trail / trial
&gt;&gt; basis ..(to XP) You can always recycle the
&gt;&gt; hardware that way. :)
&gt;Not a bad idea.  :-)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  That way the rest of you can keep working.
&gt;That's part of the problem that prompted the downgrade...  Our
&gt;equipment is... well... tired.  The monitors are almost all worn out,
&gt;the mice are trackballs for everyone except upper management, the
&gt;systems run slow, the servers are constantly crashing, clogging (You
&gt;wouldn't believe all the E-Mail's we get about major systems down/being
&gt;rebuilt or whatever) and the list just goes on and on...  (As a
&gt;minimum, to keep our existing infrastructure they'd have to replace
&gt;about 90odd percent of our monitors and mice as well as upgrading RAM
&gt;in each box - not to mention replacing/updating our Servers +
&gt;purchasing more licences.)  And I'm guessing that when they sat down
&gt;and recognised that, they figgured it was simply better to pull the
&gt;plug and start over...  Now how the decision was made to go Windows
&gt;I'll probably never know - but I'd like to at least TRY to have that
&gt;repealed before it's too late!!!  (I still think that my suggestion
&gt;works the best short and long term by simply updaing OS's/RAM and
&gt;montors/mice/Server and etc)
Hmm nothing to suggest Doze there .. I may be cheaper and more reliable
to just replace all the hardware.. (by the time you buy RAM get techs to
install OSX .. Upgrading the servers should be reasonably easy.. (given
the budget))

&gt;
&gt;But - saving that - my feeling is that if they've made their minds up
&gt;to replace rather than revamp - let's at least get their minds changed
&gt;about Windows!!!
&gt;

Um yeah ..

&gt;&gt; Point them to _Sun_ or IBM before they go broke :)
&gt;&gt; Better still get in touch with Leon Brooks
&gt;&lt;<A HREF="mailto:leon@cyberknights.com.au">leon@cyberknights.com.au</A>&gt;. I don't recognise this persons name (sorry
&gt;if you're on the list and I've inadvertantly offended)  Who is Leon?

Lean runs a company called Cyberknights.. he is taking on SCO all by
himself .. he is cool by definition and a ball of energy etc.. he seems
to have a solid business mind as well, which is not always the case for
tech types :)
<A HREF="http://www.cyberknights.com.au/">http://www.cyberknights.com.au/</A>
LOL the splash page is UM deliberate I think :)
Personally hate black websites ..

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Or Mr Bennet or Mr Hacket or Ryan and David ...
&gt;&gt; Kim etc
&gt;These names at least I recognise...  Surely they'll respond after
&gt;they've read the posts?

Surely.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Have you tried tracking down the people doing the
&gt;&gt; gig at NSW Dept.Motor Transport ..? (There are
&gt;&gt; a few other department in NSW moving or moved
&gt;&gt; as well --some only as far as Sun and Staroffice ++ )
&gt;No, Didn't think to to be honest...  Not sure I have the authority to
&gt;do so to be honest.  After all, I'm not management - and I only work in
&gt;Sales. That said, I certainly am open to hear how that can help WITHOUT
&gt;my getting my butt dragged through the fire in doing so?

Nothing to stop you on your own behalf .. call it personal research.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; I should just forward your original post to the
&gt;&gt; AULinux list ..  May I ?
&gt;Absaloutly.  That was the whole reason I threw this into the Group - to
&gt;get enough help to give Optus the best chance possible.  I'm not stupid
&gt;enough to think I can have even a CHANCE of this without some
&gt;signifgant help!!!

Might hold 24 hours see what the local gods think first. (They are
mostly on that list as well..and have street cred I don't)

&gt;
&gt;&gt; You need to have a good understanding of what
&gt;&gt; drove the original, apparently retrograde decision
&gt;&gt; in the first place.. and blanket that with a "FLOSS"
&gt;&gt; solution.
&gt;Hmmm...  I'm not sure I'm in a position to be able to find this out to
&gt;be honest.  I can have a yack with our IT Dept here in Adelaide - but
&gt;seeing as they're not actually Optus employees - I'm not sure how far
&gt;theat'll get me.
They probably know more than Optus :)
If ya don't ask you never know. :)

Go quietly into that night ...

beer almost never hurts.
