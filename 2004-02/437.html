Hi.

Ok. that _used_ to work. What is happening now, is that the spammers are
forging from addresses, and getting straight through to users mailboxes.

&gt; the masses are going to help solve the spam problem is when it 
&gt; starts costing them significant amounts of money. Perhaps 
&gt; having forked out a wad of cash for receiving a great list of 
&gt; spam, they'll be less likely to click on the link and order an 
&gt; appendage upsizing! ;)

There are others that agree with you, however there is an alternative
opinion. This discussion really should not be about how stupid the user
is (even if they are), it's about what mail should be allowed on the
network.

When the net was a friendly place, email servers were configured to
accept mail from anywhere and send it to anywhere else (open relay). No
problem, until those systems started getting abused, and it then became
'incorrect' to have an 'open relay'.

There is now a parallel to that situation. Sender addresses are being
abused by spammers and worms and virii, by sending email that claims to
be from a user that does not exist on the (originating) local network.
 
Because most mailservers trust local network users (but not remote
internet users by the open relay blocking mentioned above) the
virus/worm/whatever has free reign, and the message gets sent. There is
a similar trust arrangement between a local mailserver and an ISP's gateway.

Regardless of whether the user, the spammer, the ISP or anyone else
'pays for it' the mission is to tighten up that trust arrangement so
that the sender details are verified: Does the user exist?, Did the
email really originate from the user's upstream mailserver? 

If you open up the headers for one of the MyDoom viruses and have a dig
around with dig and whois, checking where the email originated from and
where it purports to come from, you will get the picture.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Someone let these people down.

Yes and no. They were let down by an OS that defaulted to opening
executables in mail attachments. 

On the other hand, smart spammers and virus writers have driven a truck
through the trust embodied in the current email transport system, and
the challenge is laid for it to evolve into something that remains
useful. Microsoft did not design the mail transport, so that part of the
problem cannot really be laid at their feet.

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bull!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Yep, you have a valid point. We set these people up to fail by
&gt; &gt;&gt; installing an operating system that we know is prone to abuse from
&gt; &gt;&gt; external sources and the developer of that OS stands back and does SFA
&gt; &gt;&gt; to correct the mess they have contributed to.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We did? They chose what worked for them, what their friends wanted and
&gt; &gt; what
&gt; &gt; their friends and family had used...it was the most sensible thing for
&gt; &gt; them
&gt; &gt; to do.
