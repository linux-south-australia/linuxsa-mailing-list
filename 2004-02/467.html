&gt; Accordingly, here's my question: Do any of the Linux distros have the 
&gt; ability to run Windows (XP) PC games on them - and if not, is there a 
&gt; relativly cheap program (Free is better of course) that will allow 
&gt; this software to be 'translated on the fly' when the boys put the 
&gt; discs into the machine? 

Most modern Linux distro's will be able to run WineX; Wine doesn't 
emulate Windows, instead provides a way to translate Windows calls into 
those Linux can do things with, so it can actually run applications at 
almost native speeds.  WineX is a game-specific version.  Checkout 
transgaming.com - they maintain a commercial version of WineX that 
costs a once-off US $5 or $10, but more games run underneath it than 
the free version.

Mind you, this won't work with all games.  A lot, but not all.  If you 
want a solution that automatically "translates" all games, you won't 
find it - at least, not yet, and probably not for some time.

That said, removing the ability to chuck in any program and for it to 
automatically install without your personal knowing about it isn't a 
completely bad thing, is it?  In the case of Windows, a lot of "free" 
games, such as those that come with some toy or even breakfast foods 
these days (!), are loaded with lots of ugly spyware that might not 
have a terribly nice effect on your installation, and kids seem to love 
sticking any CD they find into the nearest computer.

If you want to run lots of Windows games, I'm afraid the sane option 
simply /is/ to run Windows, and in the case of a computer that might 
need reinstallation often, keep a bootable Ghost backup of the 
installed hard drive on CD to keep your sanity.  That said, if there's 
a Linux version of a Windows game (such as Quake3, for example), 
chances are that it'll normally run a *lot* faster under Linux :-)

&gt; Now... if running PC games on a LInux distro isn't a reasonable ask: 
&gt; Does anyone know if there are appropriate educational

Oh yeah, plenty.
