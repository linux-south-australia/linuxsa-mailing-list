Thanks very much Alex, I appreciate your explanations.

&gt; &gt; Just to conclude on this,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I tried rpm -ivh --force --nodeps
&gt; &gt; php-interbase-4.3.0-alt0.cvs20030207.i586.rpm
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; and it seemed to go in OK (no error reports).
&gt;
&gt; For the record, IMHO --force and --nodeps are evil options and should never
&gt; be used unless you are fully aware of what you are doing and deliberately
&gt; want to damage your rpmdb or you are using a distro like slack which
&gt; doesn't have an rpmdb.

I wasn't aware of the likelihood of damaging the rpmdb.  I'll bear this in 
mind in future.

&gt; &gt; Then I did rpm -e php-interbase-4.3.0-alt0.cvs20030207.i586.rpm to see if
&gt; &gt; it had installed and I got a report back saying that php-interas* is not
&gt; &gt; installed.
&gt;
&gt; Exactly right. For that would mean you had installed a package called
&gt; php-interbase-4.3.0-alt0.cvs20030207.i586.rpm.i586.rpm
&gt;
&gt; Instead try rpm -e php-interbase

Worked a treat!  I recall now that I've had no success in the past on the very 
odd occasion when I've tried rpm -e and this explains it.  Curious that the 
package version doesn't need to be specified in the -e context, but I guess 
it doesn't need to be either, since there'll only ever be one version of the 
particular package installed.  

When performing most rpm installations, I have used general instructions 
printed in my old Redhat 6.1 pocket book where it indicated rpm -Uvh --force 
[package] to force an install and rpm -e [package] to uninstall.  I just 
naturally assumed the version should be included in the command.  I see now 
in man rpm (looking more closely!) that -e is used with 'package name' while 
-Uvh etc is used with 'package file'.  Thanks for the highlighting this.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Then I did rpm -ivh --force --nodeps
&gt; &gt; php-interbase-4.3.0-alt0.cvs20030207.i586.rpm, again, and this time got a
&gt; &gt; message saying that php-interbase* is already installed.
&gt;
&gt; Of course it did.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I obtained a full listing of rpms installed on the system and
&gt; &gt; php-interase* is listed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does this indicate a problem with rpm (v 4.0.4) on my system ?  Perhaps
&gt; &gt; its installer doesn't talk to its other bits too well ?
&gt;
&gt; No problem at all, except perhaps your understanding of the rpm commands.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Having got nowhere with this, I wound up compiling php4.3.4.tar.gz, and
&gt; &gt; installing that over the top of the rpm version (4.3.0).  On my Mandrake
&gt; &gt; 9.1 system, this seems to have caused no problems so far (well, none I've
&gt; &gt; noticed anyway) and firebird access is there!
&gt;
&gt; The problems will arise when you try to further upgrade that package.
&gt;
&gt; HTH

Definitely, alot.

Cheers,

Andrew
