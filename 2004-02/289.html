&gt; Just to conclude on this,
&gt; 
&gt; I tried rpm -ivh --force --nodeps 
&gt; php-interbase-4.3.0-alt0.cvs20030207.i586.rpm
&gt; 
&gt; and it seemed to go in OK (no error reports).  

For the record, IMHO --force and --nodeps are evil options and should never be used unless you are fully aware of what you are doing and deliberately want to damage your rpmdb or you are using a distro like slack which doesn't have an rpmdb.

&gt; 
&gt; Then I did rpm -e php-interbase-4.3.0-alt0.cvs20030207.i586.rpm to see if it 
&gt; had installed and I got a report back saying that php-interas* is not 
&gt; installed.

Exactly right. For that would mean you had installed a package called php-interbase-4.3.0-alt0.cvs20030207.i586.rpm.i586.rpm 

Instead try rpm -e php-interbase

&gt; 
&gt; Then I did rpm -ivh --force --nodeps 
&gt; php-interbase-4.3.0-alt0.cvs20030207.i586.rpm, again, and this time got a 
&gt; message saying that php-interbase* is already installed.

Of course it did.

&gt; 
&gt; I obtained a full listing of rpms installed on the system and php-interase* is 
&gt; listed.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this indicate a problem with rpm (v 4.0.4) on my system ?  Perhaps its 
&gt; installer doesn't talk to its other bits too well ?

No problem at all, except perhaps your understanding of the rpm commands.

&gt; 
&gt; Having got nowhere with this, I wound up compiling php4.3.4.tar.gz, and 
&gt; installing that over the top of the rpm version (4.3.0).  On my Mandrake 9.1 
&gt; system, this seems to have caused no problems so far (well, none I've noticed 
&gt; anyway) and firebird access is there!

The problems will arise when you try to further upgrade that package.
