&gt; Have you been through the Linux NFS-HOWTO, esp. 5. Optimizing NFS
&gt; Performance?

I had an older version locally, googling then resulted in a more 
updated page with more suggestions.  Thanks, I'll look into it.

&gt; e.g. Try increasing the number of instances of nfsd. (nfsd -n)

In this case, don't think it would make a difference to the transfer 
speed of one file; this would only impact me if I have performance 
problems accessing files simultaneously, I think?  In any case, 
adjusted it to 16, made zip difference.

&gt; Have you checked through the configuration of your network adapters and
&gt; interfaces (eg. MTU?).

Yeah, one of the first things I did.

&gt; Are you using NFS over TCP rather than UDP? (nfsd -t)

I believe I am, certainly the server was configured for it, and netstat 
shows rpc.* processes listening on both UDP and TCP.  Now that I think 
of it though, I probably did have to tell the client to use TCP versus 
UDP.  No idea if OS X supports this though, and if so, how.

&gt; Maybe look at top and other monitors while a copy is running, is
&gt; anything showing high usage, maybe a process or maybe the interrupt
&gt; usage is high (does top in Linux show interrupt %cpu usage, or is that 
&gt; a
&gt; FBSD thing?).

Nothing seems out of the normal.
