&gt; I'm almost certain you won't succeed.  The decision was made something

&gt; of dollars have already been spent on the change over, and at this

&gt; it's inaccurate to describe Optus's current infrastructure as 
&gt; Mac-based:
&gt; It's Windows based with Macs used for legacy applications.

Given what you say is accurate, and indeed they've already got hoards 
of Windows machines, I'd say you haven't got a chance at all either, 
unfortunately. :-(

&gt; While I'd love to see you succeed I think you've got Buckley's chance.
&gt; Worse, I'm pretty sure you'll be looking for a new job if you even try.

Hmm, unless Optus management are particularly defensive about their 
proposed/implemented systems, which I doubt (but you may know 
otherwise), I think this last comment is a tad overboard.
