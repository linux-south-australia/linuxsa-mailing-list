&gt;Hello again all,
&gt;
&gt;The following is a draft of a proposal I'm putting together to attempt
&gt;to sway Optus (my present employer) from abandoning its current tech
&gt;infrastructure of Macintosh G3 and G4's - in favour of Microsoft
&gt;Windows XP-Pro...  

I think you have lost already. 
These guys are obviously insane.
Or  have  internal communications blockages that they are
functionally so.. bet this is a "depreciation driven decision"
and nothing to do with real functionalities. (utility TCO,
security etal)

Start by suggesting that the Head Office Office Admin, Accounting,
Procurement and Costings department switch over on a Costed trail /
trial  basis ..(to XP) You can always recycle the hardware that way. :)

 That way the rest of you can keep working.

Point them to _Sun_ or IBM before they go broke :)
Better still get in touch with Leon Brooks &lt;<A HREF="mailto:leon@cyberknights.com.au">leon@cyberknights.com.au</A>&gt;.
Or Mr Bennet or Mr Hacket or Ryan and David ...Kim etc

Have you tried tracking down the people doing the gig at NSW Dept.
Motor Transport ..? (There are a few other department in NSW moving or
moved as well --some only as far as Sun and Staroffice ++ )

I should just forward your original post to the AULinux list ..
May I ?

Ryan has said everything I was going to about RAM usage.

You need to have a good understanding of what drove the original,
apparently retrograde decision in the first place.. and blanket that
with a "FLOSS" solution. 

Well there goes my 00.02.2 centidollars worth.

Pete
