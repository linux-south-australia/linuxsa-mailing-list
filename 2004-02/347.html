&gt; &gt; Did fsck actually report this as a problem?  My guess is that the
&gt; 
&gt; the filesystem can't be mounted (which is the really worrying part) so i can't
&gt; fsck it.

Firstly, you leave a file system unmounted if you are going to fsck it.

OK, you didn't quite get what I meant.  /dev/lvm is supposed to be a
character mode device.  It isn't anymore.  That means that it's been
corrupted (the *entry* for the device, not the device itself).  The
fsck that I was talking about is the one run on the file system where
/dev resides, which is most likely the root file system, "/".

I originally thought /dev/lvm might have been a special device for talking
to the underlying LVM module, but then -

&gt; <A HREF="mailto:root@connect4">root@connect4</A>:~# mount -t ext3 /dev/vg1/lv1 /data
&gt; mount: /dev/vg1/lv1 is not a valid block device
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:root@connect4">root@connect4</A>:~# ls /dev/vg1/
&gt; total 124
&gt; dr-xr-xr-x    2 root     root         4096 Feb  6 18:46 ./
&gt; drwxr-xr-x   22 root     root       118784 Feb  8 14:19 ../
&gt; crw-r-----    1 root     disk     109,   0 Feb  6 18:46 group
&gt; brw-rw----    1 root     disk      58,   0 Feb  6 18:46 lv1

shows /dev/vg1/group with the exact same major/minor number as what
you wrote before.

What does "vgdisplay -v /dev/vg1" show?

&gt; the fsck that i mentioned previously was run on the other (available)
&gt; filesystems, thinking that perhaps the LVM binaries (or some other related tool)
&gt; had been corrupted.

You didn't run fsck on a *live* file system, did you?
