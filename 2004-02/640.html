&gt; Hi Allan,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; don't remember a time without matric.
&gt;
&gt; Matric was introduced (at my school anyway) in 1969, my last year. At

Ah! Just a bit before my time - I didn't start school until around 1965/6.



&gt; &gt; Did you get my message re: Ram for that old laptop (the one you only
&gt; &gt; had 6MB for)?
&gt;
&gt; Umm, sorry, don't recall hearing about it. That must have been for the
&gt; Packard Bell Statesman. Damn thing has locked up and wont boot.

The following is a copy of what I sent:

I've been meaning to get in contact with you about this for awhile, can 
your (problem) laptop handle RAM sticks that'll fit in a "DUAL Group" 
laptop?  36 pins a side, if so, I can probably help you achieve 16MB.
&lt;/quote&gt;

&gt; Cant get rid of it, it has signatures of Linus and Bdale on the cover!
&gt; Glad we found something related to LinuxSA ... I was expecting DSL to
&gt; start bleating about OT real soon &lt;G,D&RVF&gt;

&lt;grin&gt; So, got it wrapped in plastic to preserve it then I hope!   :-)

&gt; Title: Crossover
&gt; Author: Joel Shepherd
&gt; ISBN: 0732267994
&gt; Format: Paperback
&gt; Price: $17.95
&gt; Published: March 2001
&gt; Number of Pages: 560
&gt;
&gt; A young woman is on the run, and on her own. She needs to find work and
&gt; a place to live... she needs to feel like an ordinary human being.
&gt;
&gt; But she is no ordinary human being - and when she saves the life of
&gt; Katia Neiland, President of Tanusha, the secret services discover just
&gt; how special, just how lethal, she is.
&gt;
&gt; Who can she trust? Vanessa Rice, special forces, who wants to be her
&gt; friend? The President? The Judiciary? Whoever it is she's better decide
&gt; soon. Those she left behind want her back. The League's Dark Star is a
&gt; ruthless organisation, and some people in the Federation wouldn't mind
&gt; handing her over - or causing war...
&gt;
&gt; Will she ever find safety? Can she ever stop running?

Sounds interesting, now I'm going to have to go & get a copy.

Allan
