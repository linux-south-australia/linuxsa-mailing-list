&gt; I agree with Frank :)
&gt; Jan 2003, I got so pissed with TV. The kids would argue over what to 
&gt; watch and the lead up to the latest war we just had to have, with 
&gt; "smart" bombs and all was close to inducing me to punch out da TV. I 
&gt; think I woould have lost.
&gt;
&gt; So I packed it up. Took the video, the lot and shoved it in the spare 
&gt; room. It lasted 2 weeks - my sis in law (& her hubby overseas student) 
&gt; live with us. She suffered to much so the TV migrated to her room :) 
&gt; Okay, the kids get to watch a few videos - if aunty lets them in &lt;evil 
&gt; grin&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The kids started to play again - make up games, dress up - SHARE - 
&gt; inside a few days. My 6yo took to reading up to 14 books a week. We 
&gt; actually had to take books from her.

I fully agree. Until recently (having moved back to Qld and mooched off 
my parents for somewhere to stay), we'd not had regular TV for 3 years 
(I'd not had regular TV for more like 6 years, but that's another 
story). We let the kids watch a video every now and then, but no 
commercial TV.

My wife and I never watched the TV (with the exception of the 
Olympics... but that was partly due to my in-laws coming to visit). And 
you're right, the children *did* play (well fight mostly, but at least 
they did it outside).

TV is an evil waste of time, it saps intellectual thought and feeds off 
your brain waves...   ;)
