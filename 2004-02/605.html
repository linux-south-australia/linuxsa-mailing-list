&gt;No device node is listed anywhere in dmesg.
&gt;
&gt;In my setup there is no /dev/usb/ttyACM0. There is a 
&gt;/dev/ttyACM0 though
&gt;
&gt;Scanning the device doesn't detect a modem. Kppp shows /dev/modem by
&gt;default, but can't find anything

Do you have minicom installed? [1]

(start 'minicom' at a shell prompt)
Use 'Ctl-a' then 'z' to get into minicom setup, then 'o' to setup
the modem.
Change the serial port to the above /dev/ttyACM0.

Then try to initialize the modem.  You can try 'Ctrl-a' then 'z' and
'm' to initialize the modem, or try any standard AT commands in the
main minicom screen.

If the device works with standard AT commands then you're almost
there, all you need to do now is make the symlink /dev/modem point
to /dev/ttyACM0, that way most applications will recognize it without
you having to change device configurations for your dialers and so forth.

I used this when trying to get my Roadster working some years ago [2],
back when you had to backport patches to a 2.2 kernel to get decent 
USB support. 

It worked well, although I do recall getting the modem firmware patched
by Netcomm as there were some issues with it.  Depending on how old your 
modem is this could also have something to do with your problem.


[1] There may be better ways of doing this, it's just the way that's worked
for me in the past.

[2] Hmmm, just did some googling, the internet has a long memory ;)

Very sad, I was still talking about switching 100% to Linux on my home PC,
how bizarre...
