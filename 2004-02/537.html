Don't think of them as "Reality TV" -- because they plainly aren't real.

Do you seriously think that Big Brother's producer doesn't control your
perception of the contestants by cleverly choosing the 3 minutes (out of
the last 24 hours) worth of footage you're going to see each person
featuring in during the nightly broadcast?

Do you really think it was a big shock worthy of a New Idea when one of
the original Pop Stars contestants was kicked out for stealing?  Was it
*still* worthy when you think about the fact that it was all filmed 
six months before it aired, so everyone concerned knew it had happened
before the series even reached TV, but they all carried out the first two
months of the series pretending that the kicked-out contestant still had
a chance?

So it isn't Reality TV.  So what is it?

Game shows.

Yes, game shows.  Only you can't call them game shows, because everyone's
too hip to watch them.  So you call them reality TV instead.  But they're
still game shows.

There isn't a lot of difference between the emotional highs and lows 
that are felt in those shows versus the emotional highs and lows felt
by a gibbering, giggling hearts-a-flutter "New Price Is Right" audience
member who has just been told to "come on down."  It's all the same.

With one small detail of difference:  Have you noticed how DULL those
shows are?  My girlfriend watched the last series of The Bachelor -- DULL!
Sooooo maaaaaany reeeeeeaally looooong, sloooooow shots of people walking
about from place to place, or looking at each other across a room crowded
with other people doing exactly the same thing.  I sat with her one night
and watched an episode;  I swear I could feel my brain atrophying between
the commercials.  Oh my god!
