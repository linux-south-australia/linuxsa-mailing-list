Hey all,

Has anybody else had problems over the past couple of months with any
unsolicited email? I'm pretty sure that the emails in question are due to my
email address being listed within the mail archive pages on the LinuxSA
website. Both my email addresses receive the same messages, but only one is
still subscribed. The other was unsubscribed when I switched ISPs, but the
ISP hasn't deactivated the account yet - well, at least as far as email is
concerned.

The messages I have been getting are either the very occasional message
offering to sell me some sort of drug - starts with a "v" but being careful
not to mention which it is, because I know what some people's email servers
are like when it comes to blocking objectionable emails. The other ones are
slightly more regular, usually from strange people in foreign countries
claiming to be the son, daughter, nephew, etc. of some rich important
person, begging my help in the form of providing my bank details to enable
them to transfer five million dollars (or whatever it may be) out of the
country. At first, these are slightly amusing, but I am now finding them
incredibly irritating.

Does anybody else have these problems? Anyone have any other suggestions as
to where they might be originating? (Hotmail has crossed my mind, because my
old email address is registered as a "Microsoft .net Passport", which
accounts for a large quantity of "spam" in that account, but not for the
other messages appearing in both accounts.) Is it at all possible to remove
the ability to view email addresses (automatically, perhaps manually still
could be available for legitimate purposes) from the site? Is it possible
for the automatic scanner programs to locate and record people whose email
address link appears as their name, or must it only be a plaintext email
address in the form <A HREF="mailto:name@domain.com.au">name@domain.com.au</A> or whatever?

I await in anticipation of all your advice, discussion, opinion, etc.

- Adam Towill
