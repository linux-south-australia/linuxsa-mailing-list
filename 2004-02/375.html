Hi

* Aaron &lt;<A HREF="mailto:apoeze@bigpond.net.au">apoeze@bigpond.net.au</A>&gt; [2004-02-09 11:47]:
&gt; Spam is an enormous problem and frankly the spammers are winning.
&gt; Filtration is the main method of control nowdays but that's no
&gt; substitute for being careful where you submit your address.  My main
&gt; address is fairly clean but my yahoo spam attractant address is nasty.
&gt; The yahoo filter gets about 80% of it and only buggers up 1 in 100
&gt; emails or so.

I still have a senet email address. I cleaned it out with fetchmail to /dev/null
the other day, (1500 messages, mailbox full) and 24 hours later it had 377
messages, all spam. 

SPAM is an unfortunate fact of life on the internet. It's an annoyance, perhaps we
will claw back some of the lost ground, perhaps we won't. It's a byproduct of our
society, and IMO in the same league as those blighters that ring up asking if you
want to buy their products and services without an invitation. 

&gt; 
&gt; Spam seems awash with 'v', male appendage or female mammary enhancement,
&gt; and issues related to money.  I assume it's because these are the most
&gt; successful.  What drives me right up the wall is that there must be
&gt; people out there who actually believe this stuff and cough up.  It
&gt; should go past the point of irritation though and into the joyful realm
&gt; of apathy, spam is that pervasive and persistent you'd go mad otherwise.

Bill Gates will fix it for cents per mail. If he gets that through he will have
profits like never before...

&gt; 
&gt; If these messages are arhived publicly I hope they're protected from
&gt; spiders.  Many spiders are quite stupid but there are some which can
&gt; pull an address even masked by tricks like <A HREF="mailto:somedude@NOSPAMsomewhere.com">somedude@NOSPAMsomewhere.com</A>
&gt; , javascript or encryption.  Theoretically as long as a viewer can view
&gt; your email address publically the spambots can extract it.

Last I checked, every email address is exposed on the web in the linuxsa mail
archives. As is. Prepare for some extra payload on your mailserver :)

&gt; 
&gt; Hotmail is not good.  They even admit to spamming you in their agreement
&gt; with you.

Not apologising for the spam, but Hotmail _is_ a free service...

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt;Hey all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Has anybody else had problems over the past couple of months with any
&gt; &gt;unsolicited email? I'm pretty sure that the emails in question are due to 
&gt; &gt;my
&gt; &gt;email address being listed within the mail archive pages on the LinuxSA
&gt; &gt;website. Both my email addresses receive the same messages, but only one is
&gt; &gt;still subscribed. The other was unsubscribed when I switched ISPs, but the
&gt; &gt;ISP hasn't deactivated the account yet - well, at least as far as email is
&gt; &gt;concerned.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The messages I have been getting are either the very occasional message
&gt; &gt;offering to sell me some sort of drug - starts with a "v" but being careful
&gt; &gt;not to mention which it is, because I know what some people's email servers
&gt; &gt;are like when it comes to blocking objectionable emails. The other ones are
&gt; &gt;slightly more regular, usually from strange people in foreign countries
&gt; &gt;claiming to be the son, daughter, nephew, etc. of some rich important
&gt; &gt;person, begging my help in the form of providing my bank details to enable
&gt; &gt;them to transfer five million dollars (or whatever it may be) out of the
&gt; &gt;country. At first, these are slightly amusing, but I am now finding them
&gt; &gt;incredibly irritating.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does anybody else have these problems? Anyone have any other suggestions as
&gt; &gt;to where they might be originating? (Hotmail has crossed my mind, because 
&gt; &gt;my
&gt; &gt;old email address is registered as a "Microsoft .net Passport", which
&gt; &gt;accounts for a large quantity of "spam" in that account, but not for the
&gt; &gt;other messages appearing in both accounts.) Is it at all possible to remove
&gt; &gt;the ability to view email addresses (automatically, perhaps manually still
&gt; &gt;could be available for legitimate purposes) from the site? Is it possible
&gt; &gt;for the automatic scanner programs to locate and record people whose email
&gt; &gt;address link appears as their name, or must it only be a plaintext email
&gt; &gt;address in the form <A HREF="mailto:name@domain.com.au">name@domain.com.au</A> or whatever?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I await in anticipation of all your advice, discussion, opinion, etc.
&gt; &gt;
