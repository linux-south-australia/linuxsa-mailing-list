&gt; EROS looks very interesting.  Have you ever used it?

I compiled it up a couple of years ago to the "Hello World" stage.
That's all it did, so it was very rugged in that regard (although
the author appears to run a lot of other software on it that hadn't
been released).  Back then, it only had disk drivers for an Adaptec
controller, so SCSI was a must (and the machine I tested it on went
on to do other "more useful" work, so that Window of opportunity
closed).  It appears that an IDE driver is still on the TODO list,
but from what I read recently it appears that they're trying hard
to get it to run under Bochs, which may abstract that problem away
(plus give Dan Shearer another arrow to stick in his emulation
quiver :-).

It looks like the group had a brief sojourn writing a CVS "replacement"
(www.opencm.org) which is what piqued my interest in EROS again
recently, so once I have opencm up and running I'll give it another
whirl, and may actually contribute something to it.  I think it
shows a lot of promise if it can get a sufficient critical mass of
Open Source enthusiasts.
