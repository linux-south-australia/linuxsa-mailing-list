Hi,

I'm just introducing myself to this mailing list.  Feel free to let the 
eyes glaze over and reach for the delete key if you like.  This is 
almost a novelty as I haven't used a mailing list in years.  Naturally I 
have questions but I think an introduction and a bit of watching would 
be a good idea right now.  So hello to you all.

I found your list via the main linuxSA web site.  I googled to get the 
website :)

I am a true newbie to linux.  I really have very little understanding of 
it and only typed the odd 'ls' command on unix university systems years 
ago.  I'm a Microsftophile really or rather, was one.  You could say I'm 
converting.. or trying to.  I'm also from SA which is probably obvious 
when joining a LinuxSA mailing list, I guess.

I have a lone WindowsXP system I desire to get Linux working on with a 
dual boot arrangement.  I've been looking here there and everywhere 
about it.  I decided to go with Mandrake 9.2 for it's reputably good 
installation and hardware detection and popularity in case I have gnarly 
questions.  I even have the disks now.  I have a raid0 arrangement and 
telstra Cable both of which seem to be problem areas for installation, 
the raid being a real killer for a newbie like me.

I've ironed out most of my software fears.  There seems to be ways 
around my commonly used WinXP/MS programs using Linux versions instead 
for almost everything.  Well, except for games and even there there's 
some which work one way or the other.

My limited experience with Linux so far has been trying the run-on-a-CD 
distro Knoppix 3.3.  I was quite impressed.  In terms of usability and 
the GUI Linux won't be any problem for most newbies I'd say.

I have some free advice too.  Imagine that, advice from a newbie!  You 
say on the linuxSA website one of your goals is for promotion.  I can 
help with that, at least for newbies and probably for others as well. 
The main linux.org website has a groups section here;

<A HREF="http://www.linux.org/groups/index.html">http://www.linux.org/groups/index.html</A>

Your linuxSA site is not listed (under Australia).  Quite a few people 
refer to the address above and so I'm positive a listing would help.
