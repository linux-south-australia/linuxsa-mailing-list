I know this was written with humour but the issue for most users of is one 
of easy learning. I was thinking of 'capacity' but I'm not sure that's 
always correct. There's always going to be some users who are frankly too 
dumb to work 'it' out, whatever 'it' is. However, they still need the 
functionality, perhaps in work. For others, the learning curve may be steep 
but they'll finally get there.

I've got a Netware and windows background and now have a distinct interest 
in Linux. To be honest, setting up a server to do exactly what I want has 
been very trying. (Core file serving, web, DNS, DHCP, FAX serving, etc). In 
Netware, I'd find this dead easy but lack of familiarity and deplorable 
documentation is making my exploration of Linux very tough.

I think I'll have to start posting those issues to the list. In the end, 
you just want to get things done, stable and working.
