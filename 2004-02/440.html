Oooerrr....

&gt; &gt; So you've missapproriated a police name? That's good. I hope that this
&gt; &gt; doesn't entail the same penalties as misapproriating a police uniform!
&gt; 
&gt; What the....? I WORK for SAPol in the State Intelligence Branch as an
&gt; Intelligence Analyst. Not everyone in SAPol is a cop and in fact, my
&gt; position is SPECIFICALLY for non-cops with degrees which are useful to the
&gt; organisation, mine being in science with chemistry majors.

Ok, so my definition of a "cop" is a little too broad for your liking. I
tend to define people who work for "SAPOL" [I trust you're not going to
claim you don't] as a "cop". I take that one back.

Try: SAPOL WORKER!

&gt; &gt; If you don't care less - let me put it the most eloquent way I can - say
&gt; &gt; nothing at all about it. You obviously care a little more than less...
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe so. I wasn't formally informing you specifically that I hated WH and
&gt; LoTR but was making an off-the-cuff remark.

You were.

&gt; I was reliably informed that this list is part tech forum part social
&gt; club. 

Of course it is; you could even quote me saying the same thing. I have a
suspicion that I was the one who said it to you in the first place...

&gt; In a ocial situation do you make it abundantly clear that everything you
&gt; say is directly related to the topic at hand and that you won't say
&gt; anything off-topic?

No, but I *do* tell people precisely what I think about what they're saying.
Yeah, true, it does have the effect that those who care to associate with me
in person socially tend to be the types of people who can cope with me
telling the blunt truth about them -- but I choose not to associate
with people who cave under the slightest hint of pressure or rudeness as
friends.

&gt; Having witnessed it first hand, I know you don't.

;-)

&gt; &gt; ROFL
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you think that you have the proof then why don't you actually call me
&gt; &gt; a dumbarse [sic] (I think you mean dumb arse - i.e. an arse that does
&gt; &gt; not speak) out in the open?
&gt; 
&gt; The less said about your arse, the better.

Yes, let's leave *that* for the catwalk ;-P

&gt; Besides, I meant it in the colloquial not the formal. Don't play
&gt; pedantics with a master of the art.

A master? I see...I'll play pedantics with you, good man.

&gt; Plus it's pretty clear I wasn't calling you a dumbarse. If I wanted to,
&gt; I'd have no hesitation. If you ARSEume nothing else, ASSume that.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; THEY HATES US, YES THEY HATES US; THOSE FILTHY HOBITTSES!\
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; *pmsl*
&gt; 
&gt; Errr, I'm not up to speed on 'net jargon. Lil' help?

Pissing Myself Laughing. I've never actually done that literally although I
have been known to blurt drink on occasions. The last time was when a well
meaning old Italian lady told my friend who is:

 a) an ex drug addict
 b) whose partner had overdosed
 c) who had just tried to commit suicide using a huge amount of prescription
    drugs

that:

 a) using drugs was evil
 b) that a workmate had committed suicide using them
 c) that they'd make you kill themselves

I coped with (a) and (b) but (c) was just WAY too much. Unfortunately I'd
just swallowed a mouthful of my Fanta :(

So, PMSL....
