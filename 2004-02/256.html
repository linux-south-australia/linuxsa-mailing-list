Aaron,

&gt; I'm just introducing myself to this mailing list.  Feel free to let the 
&gt; eyes glaze over and reach for the delete key if you like.  This is 
&gt; almost a novelty as I haven't used a mailing list in years.  Naturally I 
&gt; have questions but I think an introduction and a bit of watching would 
&gt; be a good idea right now.  So hello to you all.

Always good, although you shouldn't listen to the Lady Galadriel (aka
Romana). I, the Wise Wizard, am the leader of the White Council - she seeks
to use the Ring to her own means, methinks!

&gt; I found your list via the main linuxSA web site.  I googled to get the 
&gt; website :)

Given your "new" status is there anything you can think of that LinuxSA can
do to help make itself more well known?

&gt; I am a true newbie to linux.  I really have very little understanding of 
&gt; it and only typed the odd 'ls' command on unix university systems years 
&gt; ago.  I'm a Microsftophile really or rather, was one.  You could say I'm 
&gt; converting.. or trying to.  I'm also from SA which is probably obvious 
&gt; when joining a LinuxSA mailing list, I guess.

Not at all obvious actually. If you ever send anything to "LinuxSA" please
make sure it's obviously to Linux SOUTH AUSTRALIA. There is a Linux SOUTH
AFRICA and mail has been known to go west [literally].

&gt; I have a lone WindowsXP system I desire to get Linux working on with a 
&gt; dual boot arrangement.

The CSDN - csdn.auug.org.au - can help you get a distro but I see you
already have the disks.

&gt; My limited experience with Linux so far has been trying the run-on-a-CD 
&gt; distro Knoppix 3.3.  I was quite impressed.  In terms of usability and 
&gt; the GUI Linux won't be any problem for most newbies I'd say.

Unfortunately Linux doesn't have as good a marketing dept. as other OSes but
we're getting there.

&gt; I have some free advice too.  Imagine that, advice from a newbie!  You 
&gt; say on the linuxSA website one of your goals is for promotion.  I can 
&gt; help with that, at least for newbies and probably for others as well. 
&gt; The main linux.org website has a groups section here;
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.linux.org/groups/index.html">http://www.linux.org/groups/index.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Your linuxSA site is not listed (under Australia).  Quite a few people 
&gt; refer to the address above and so I'm positive a listing would help.

Well make one - in LinuxSA there is no King but in time and with patience
and in your own way you may become one of The Royals.

Welcome 0-)

BTW Romana is involved in itshareSA (<A HREF="http://cai-sa.linunix.com/">http://cai-sa.linunix.com/</A>) - itshare
can help you get Linux skills whilst at the same time helping the
disadvantaged, the lonely and poor.
