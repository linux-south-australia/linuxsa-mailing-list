&gt; Hi David,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; with a CDROM?  that makes it much easier.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; NO &lt;sigh&gt; but I think it will take the Xircom PCMCIA network card so 
&gt; that should help.

Depending on what Xircom it is you will have mixed success. Some of the
older ones are nearly impossible to get working with any stability.
Xircom was not the most open about releasing doco on their cards :( 
They have been better since they got taken over (Intel I think).

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; have you go into the compaq bios?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Cant see how to get into it. They say you hit F10 but they also rely on 
&gt; a Diagnostic partition hidden on the drive. This didn't come with a 
&gt; drive so I have downloaded all the support software for it. Still no 
&gt; luck.

On the compaq I have (a older model, it's a 486) I have to use a
diagnostic / setup disc to play with any of the BIOS settings. I do not
know for sure, but I would suspect that it is still the case with your
model.

&gt; 
&gt; At present I only get so far as the LEDs lighting up. Not a thing else 
&gt; takes place. No floppy access, no RAM count etc so as far as I have 
&gt; seen it isn't even getting into POST.

That just sounds bad. I would check the CMOS battery however, it's
possible it has gone flat. Also try booting with no HDD, it could be
faulty.
