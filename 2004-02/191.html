Hi,

Sorry about that, I read laptop and assumed pcmcia .....

I've not worked with the pci cards, but the following is from my
experience with the pcmcia cards, maybe it's applicable to you as well:

a. Make sure you've got the latest wireless tools. This can make a huge
difference.

b. Are u using the Orinoco drivers that come with the pcmcia package, or
the kernels drivers. I found the best results with the kernels dirvers.


dmesg | more

Make sure you see the following:

eth1: index 0x01: Vcc 5.0, irq 12, io 0x0100-0x013f

It must be running the correct voltage, I've had it that the voltage
gets set 2 3v. It looked like it was running fine, but wasn't.

Hope this helps .....


Here's some documentation I found:

A Writer's View of the Linux Wireless Dream, Part 1
Setting SuSE 8.0 Linux Up for the SMC2632W Wireless Card

Rob Reilly


The first order of business was to get the stock card working, before I
did any hardware hacking or modifications. Hardware hacking of the card
will be described in the next story in this series. Since the SMC 2632
card was a Prism2 chip from Intersil, it was a given I was going to use
the wlan-ng drivers. There were a few files that needed to be changed in
order to get the card recognized and working properly under the Linux
2.4.18-4GB kernel. 

The first file that had to be changed was /etc/modules.config. I added
an entry for the wireless card. 

alias wlan0 prism2_cs


And, I almost forgot to run depmod, as root.


depmod -a

I also created a file in /etc/sysconfig/network called ifcfg-wlan0. The
card was set with DHCP, although you could easily use static IPs too. It
looked like this:


DEVICE=wlan0
ONBOOT=no
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
USERCTL=yes
DHCLIENT_SET_DOWN_LINK=yes
STARTMODE=hotplug
MODE="Managed"
UNIQUE=""


Next was the config file in /etc/pcmcia directory. I had to make sure
that the SMC2632 entry was bound to the prism2 card. It looked like:


card "SMC2632W"
manfid 0x0156, 0x0002
bind "prism2_cs"

The last file that needed editing was the wlan-ng.opts file in the
/etc/pcmcia directory. I had to make sure the IS_ADHOC line said "no,"
like this. 

IS_ADHOC=no
# y|n, y - adhoc, n - infrastructure

I also had to set the variables for Auth Type and DesiredSSID. I left
the DesiredSSID empty so that it could just pick up the first access
point it found. They looked like this:


AuthType="opensystem"     
# opensystem | sharedkey (requires WEP)
DesiredSSID=""

I didn't bother with WEP initially because my location was fairly
isolated and I could accept the risk of a neighborhood hacker. This is
something you will need to determine on your own, however. If you are in
a corporate setting, then you will definitely need to read the wlan-ng
documentation to set this security measure up. 

WEP isn't all that great anyway, since programs like Airsnort can figure
out the encryption keys. VPN sounds like a good start to securing a
wireless link, but, I haven't started working with that yet. Perhaps in
a later article. 

With all the files edited, it was time to start up the stock PCMCIA
card, grab an IP and see how it worked.

Thanks for that ..... but

&gt;Quick guide to setting up wireless:

&gt;/etc/rc.d/pcmcia/wireless.opts
&gt;  
&gt;
It is not a pcmcia card and as far as I can tell this bit does not apply

&gt;B. Next find out what your wireless device is
&gt;
&gt;<A HREF="mailto:root@lcm">root@lcm</A>:/etc/pcmcia# iwconfig
&gt;  
&gt;
iwconfig gives (amongst other things):
wlan0   IEEE820-11b  ESSID:""
           Mode:Auto Access Point: 00:00:00:00:00:00:00
           Encryption Point:off

- so prism2_pci appears to be running OK

&gt;C. restart pcmcia devices
&gt;   /etc/rc.d/rc.pcmcia restart
&gt;  
&gt;
again does not apply


&gt;d. Give the wireless an IP.
&gt;ifconfig eth1 192.168.10.2 broadcast 192.168.10.0 netmask
&gt;255.255.255.224
&gt;  
&gt;
in my case - ifconfig wlan0 192.168 .......... etc   reports:
"SIOCSIFFFLAGS : no such device

The question is - where does wlan0 come from and what controls it - I 
cannot find a howto that explains that part.

Cheers
Frank

&gt;Subject: wireless card setup
&gt;
&gt;Hi
&gt;I have an Actiontec 802MIP mini PCI wireless card in a laptop running 
&gt;Fedora.
&gt;lspci lists it as a Prism2.5 which is consistent with informationI can 
&gt;find on the card.
&gt;I have tried both prism2_pci (from linux wlan-ng) and orinoco _pci
(part
&gt;
&gt;of fedora instl) and both seem to load OK but when it comes to 
&gt;configuring wlan the system complains that no wlan0 device is present.
&gt;Where does 'wlan0' come from ?
&gt;... or a pointer to a  _good_ wireless setup howto.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers
&gt;Frank
