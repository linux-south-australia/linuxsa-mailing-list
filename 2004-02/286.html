<H1>What is mozilla doing while loading?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I'm trying to understand why Mozilla takes so long to start up. 
The system I'm using is Gentoo, kernel 2.6.1(no nptl), and CFLAGS
set to:
  -O2 -mcpu=athlon -march=athlon -mmmx -m3dnow -pipe \
  -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops
Oh, and the cpu here is a 900MHz Duron.

The times shown are for mozilla starting up then as soon as a window
appears, being closed manually (approximately 0.8 second reaction
time).
"First run" is for the first loading of Mozilla after booting up.
"Second run" is after closing mozilla, then starting again.

Loading mozilla (1.6) on startup, not prelinked, with:

         export XPCOM_CHECK_THREADSAFE=0

..uncommented in /usr/bin/mozilla

####First run:####
$ time mozilla

real    0m13.070s
user    0m3.761s
sys     0m1.617s

####Second run:####
$ time mozilla

real    0m5.644s
user    0m3.663s
sys     0m1.424s

...so, this seems to be strange. 13 real seconds starting up,
virtually no disk activity, and only 5.378s of that actually used.
What are the remaining 7.692 seconds for?
Second run is similar for user+sys time, but much less cpu time is
wasted. (0.557s - probably just reaction time)

Now, with prelinking of everything done (/usr/sbin/prelink -amR):

####First run:####
$ time mozilla

real    0m13.653s
user    0m3.182s
sys     0m0.415s

####Second run:####
$ time mozilla

real    0m5.661s
user    0m3.634s
sys     0m1.612s

 ..now this is more puzzling. 13 real seconds still used - that
puzzle was from before though - seems prelinking didn't help the
real time much. But it did help the user and sys times - only 3.597s
total. But then the second (and 3rd and 4th) runs of the prelinked
mozilla were almost as bad in terms of user+sys time as the first
run of the non-prelinked mozilla.

 So now there are two questions. What is mozilla waiting for in the
7.5 seconds of idle time on the first runs? And why has prelinking
only decreased the user+sys time of the first run?

 Michael.
