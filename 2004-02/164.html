Scott,

&gt; I know this one might be slighty OT as I am talking about MS Windows, but
&gt; it is related to my near favourite open source browser Mozilla.

No, it's not off topic. It's about Mozilla - not about Windows. It displays
the same behaviour in Linux too.

&gt; My only big beef with Mozilla is that it reuses the window for launching
&gt; shortcuts from email etc.  ie. if I have a browser session open and click
&gt; on a hyperlink in an email, it opens in the current browser session and
&gt; cannot seem to be set to open a new window/session.  I know I can copy and
&gt; paste the URL into a new window but it is very tedious.

I've got Mozilla 1.6 (Debian Unstable) at the moment. I can't see any
obvious way to do this. I tried:

 about:config

...and then tries "url" and "mail" as a filter. I was looking for one which
intimated that mail would open in a NEW window. I couldn't find it...damn.

I seem to recall a setting in one of the Netscapes/Mozillas which went "Open
url in current window" but can't remember which one it was.

&gt; Any ideas / suggestions on a fix?  or is it just one for the developers
&gt; wish list?

No, I'd file it as a bug but look in bugzilla.org first.

&gt; Thanks

With the greatest pleasure especially since I've not been terribly helpful
;-P
