Hey,

Yes, the theoretical limit for Cat5 cabling is 100 metres, although due to
surrounding conditions, cable quality, and a range of other issues, these
cables often don't perform up to this standard, and for example, will maybe
work up to 80 metres on one day, 60 the next and maybe 90 the day after.

Good news is that you can get dedicated repeater devices. I havent had the
opportunity of buying or using one because a) apparently not that cheap and
b) there is no distance from any point in my house that spans 100 metres.
Yes, you could use a hub/switch. That would mean 2 distances of 50 metres,
or whatever, because the hub/switch effectively 'repeats' the data in much
the same way as the repeaters will.

Yeah, fibre was my other suggestion, but good point. Give it a try with the
hub, and see how it goes. This is a better shot than just straight Cat5
cable.

Good luck.

- Adam

Subject: [O/T] Cat 5 cable length - repeaters


&gt; I know that the nominal max length of Cat 5 is 100 Metres, but how much
&gt; further can you go ?  Can you get signal repeaters to extend it by a ittle
&gt; bit.
&gt;
&gt; Our Sydney branch is on the 4th floor of a building and require some
&gt; additional office space short term for 9 months on the 1st floor. I've
&gt; advised them just to run some Cat5 down there although the cabler inists
&gt; that it is too far by the time it goes across the building/ down the
ducting
&gt; and back to the office are he thinks it is over 100 metres.
&gt;
&gt; Options I can see are
&gt;
&gt; 1) just asking him to cable it anyway and see if it works.
&gt; 2) Putting some sort of repeater or Hub/switch at level 2 or thereabouts (
&gt; Are there dedicated repeaters available )
&gt;
&gt; Fibre is overkill given the number of people down there/ short term nature
&gt; and cost of terminating hardware.
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt;
