I'd suggest starting with Page Data.  They're pretty good
about the sort of small quantity sales you want to make.
The other places mentioned is this thread are also fine.

In any case, develop a relationship.  All cabling jobs
get odd at some stage -- you might need to traverse a
fire wall or exit a roof or something as equally as
horrible.  Having a supplier who will listen and make
a sensible parts suggestion helps a lot.

For specialist stuff (not what you want today, but for
router cables and the like) there is Connect Electronics .

You should be aware that many of the parts come from
interstate suppliers, who you could order from anyway.
For example, Anderson Corporation for optical odds and
sods.

&gt; Especially anyone who sells CAT5 is colours other than 'blue'.
&gt; Red would be handy ... for those "do not touch this cable" kind of
&gt; installations. I used to have a handy colour scheme like green for
&gt; analog phone, blue for network data, red for core network data, 
&gt; black digital phone etc.

Don't do this.  For two reasons

1) It defeats the purpose of structured cabling.  The
   fixed cabling that carries data today might carry
   an alarm signal tomorrow.

   If you need to colour code, then use those coloured
   paper stick-on dots you buy in rolls and stick them
   on the outlets.  You can even get them with cute icons.

2) Building cabling has a colour scheme which is reasonably
   standard.  If you want to use coloured cables, please
   don't create your own standard.

&gt; Actually ready made patch cables would be good too =)

I'd recommend this over making your own.  The "stranded core
category 5 unshielded twisted pair" you buy in rolls has
a lighter jacket than ready-made patch cables.  This is
good when making patches to length in data cabinets as
the cables are flexible enough to work well in tight
spaces, but sucks for links to PCs (you step on it, it
dies).
