&gt; I'm not totally opposed to the idea of email attracting a per-recipient
&gt; fee.  I am opposed to the idea having to pay for email, but 
&gt; I'm even more opposed to the idea of having to receive spam. 
&gt;  I don't know how to solve the spam problem but I'm pretty 
&gt; sure that making email cost something, and it doesn't really 
&gt; matter how small an amount, will change the economics of the 
&gt; business.  10,000,000 addresses at 0.1 cents each is huge if 
&gt; you only expect to get ten to one hundred responses.
&gt; 

Which all sounds reasonable until the spammers/virus writers react to
the 'upping of the ante', by account-jacking and sending out millions of
messages on some poor soul's account, and placing them at the mercy of
whoever is charged with collecting the loot.

This is what is happening today with carjacking. The industry has
generally solved the problem of car theft by forced entry. New cars are
immobile without the correct keys. Microchip Keys... (scary details: fry
your Camry ECU by trying to start it with a drowned or damaged key too
many times, and the only option is a new ECU from Japan for about $2500)

It's two steps forward, one back: We have less new-car thefts, but an
increase in assaults related to vehicle theft. Cars are starting to
appear with door locks that activate once the vehicle starts moving...

Regards,

Michael
