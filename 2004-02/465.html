&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Rather a long one - my apologies to those with little patience in advance:
&gt; 
&gt; After many months (about 6? now) of lurking, combined with afew months of playing with the RH (v9) distro - I am now ready to take the plunge and convert my entire Home Network (4 box's in total) to Linux as (a) I'm sick of constantly plugging holes in Mr Gates's wonderful software - and (b) I finally feel confident of being able to competnently install software/games not already installed in whatever distro I get - as well as being able to network the pooters, share the DSL, printer and etc.  (Don't worry - I'm sure the frantic cries for help won't be long in coming...  *Grins*)
&gt; 
&gt; The ONLY problem I'm facing that I'm NOT sure how to handle/get around is the fact that my boys PC (Used by my 4 and 3 year old boys) which is currently running Win XP-Pro - runs educational software (about 10discs in total) that is designed to run on Windows...
&gt; 
&gt; Accordingly, here's my question: Do any of the Linux distros have the ability to run Windows (XP) PC games on them - and if not, is there a relativly cheap program (Free is better of course) that will allow this software to be 'translated on the fly' when the boys put the discs into the machine?  Now... if running PC games on a LInux distro isn't a reasonable ask: Does anyone know if there are appropriate educational games (that make math, english education fun for a 4 and 3 year old - that's challenging but adictivly fun at the same time) that have already been ported over to Linux???  For the record (as far as distros go) I don't have any brand loyalty to speak of so don't worry about offence being taken if it's Lindows that you think would be best - similarly no other brand is out either!!!  (With the ONE exception being that what is suggested MUST be GUI based - as I'm not (yet) able to handle CLI interfaces.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as what I want to do with the boxes, I want the boys box to be able to primarily play educational games, DVD's, listen to music, surf the Net, E-Mail as well as be able to use 'Office' type software... as well as accessing/using a picture drawing programme similar to the 'Paint' programme both boys are currently addicted to...  If it matters, the boys PC is currently a Genuine Intel Pentium 3 (1GHz) Processor, running with 256MB of SD-RAM as well as a 32MB Video Card, 3COM NIC, Onboard (MB) Sound and a 40GB HDD running an old 15" monitor (Compaq) I upgraded from awhile back.
&gt; 
&gt; As to the other 3 boxes I've got, there's no Windows software I cannot live without, so it matters not what distros I put on these I'm thinking - as long as I can emulate what I'm doing with my existing network which is:  Using one of the boxes as a Server primarily (All my movies, TV Eps and Music are stored on it) with write permission restricted to that box, and those directorys (only) shared to the other 3 boxes on the LAN thereby enabeling any of the other boxes to stream music, tv eps or whatever through the LAN either to the TV in the lounge, or wherever else.  Apart from these 2 exceptions (Boys PC and the other PC that doubles as a Server/workstation) it's a standard setup with no issues I can think of that I should specifically mention.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas on which Distro(s) would be most suited so I can get started giving Mr Gate's - and the abundant proliferation of Viri (etc) his wonderful distro seems to attrack - the flick from our home/lives?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for the advice!
&gt; 
&gt; David WOLVERTON
