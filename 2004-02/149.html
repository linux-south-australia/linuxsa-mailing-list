I agree with you totally
My description may have been a bit misleading, basically i'm not talking 
about all new users, just new users i add for the specific purposes of 
editing the web areas

Thanks for the confirmation tho

Andrew Pullin said the following on 4/02/2004 3:05 PM:

&gt;Hi Craig (and All),
&gt;    I would be a bit wary of giving all newusers write and execute access to
&gt;the website areas. What do you want to do? If you want all new users to have
&gt;admin rights to the website - do as you describe. If you want newusers to be
&gt;able to set up their own web pages and let apache serve them, then there is
&gt;an easier and better way.
&gt;
&gt;    Apache has a method of setting a specific directory hanging off a users
&gt;directory that it will serve web pages, and another directory for cgi
&gt;scripts. It allows outsiders to get a persons web page by something like
&gt;www.somedomain/~someuser . This allows any user to create this directory (or
&gt;automagically create it with the /etc/skel/ ). The user can then put
&gt;anything they want into the directory, edit whatever in it and generally do
&gt;what users do. The best thing about this method is that Apache won't let
&gt;outsiders into where they are not supposed to be by doing something like
&gt;this: www.somedomain/~someuser/../../ which under some systems dumps the
&gt;outsider into the root directory, which is not very desirable.
&gt;
&gt;    The Apache docs tell you how to set this up, well version 2.0.* does. It
&gt;is fairly straight forward, and by the sounds of it more what you might be
&gt;getting at. If you actually DO want some users to have admin access to the
&gt;website areas, you can still set up a group specifically to do so, but you
&gt;are better adding specific users to this group to maintain control over the
&gt;website, not allowing blanket access to all new users. Hope this has helped.
&gt;    Cheers!
&gt;        Andrew.

&gt;Subject: Linux Group and User permissions
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hi all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm heading into an area of user / group permissions that is bouncing
&gt;&gt;against the limits of my experience so i thought i'd throw my thoughts
&gt;&gt;to the list for some feedback
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;basically i want to setup a user who has editing capabilities to some
&gt;&gt;web pages/directories
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;currently the all web directories are owned by the apache group and user
&gt;&gt;with read, write and exec permissions
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;my thoughts are to create a "webedit" group of which the "newuser" is a
&gt;&gt;member of
&gt;&gt;change ownership of the relavent directories and files to the webedit
&gt;&gt;group and give the group permissions read and write access and user
&gt;&gt;(apache) permissions read and exec access
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;1. Is this just a huge jumble that probably wont work
&gt;&gt;2. Is there another / better way
&gt;&gt;3. Is there any advice to give on this area that anyone has
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Cheers
&gt;&gt;
