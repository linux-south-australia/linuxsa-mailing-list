&gt;Considering the hell people get given for not writing documentation you

&gt;
&gt;I think there are degrees of the 'RTFM argument'. An RTFM for some 
&gt;obscure badly documented technical magic is uncalled for. Although a 
&gt;quick google before asking is usually appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;But there are extremes cases where the RTFM argument is the only one.
&gt;
&gt;Have you ever read those warnings on hand dryers that advise against 
&gt;drying your face incase you fuse your eyes? Or the ones on hair dryers 
&gt;about using them in the bath. The labels are there because hospitals 
&gt;(and morgues) get a steady stream of people doing these amazingly
&gt;fucked up things every day.
&gt;
&gt;Some of these same people use computers. When these people aren't 
&gt;electrocuting themselves or fusing their eyeballs they spend most of 
&gt;their time opening virus attachments, typing their credit card numbers 
&gt;in response to emails from "their bank", installing "Microsoft
&gt;Updates", 
&gt;  forwarding chain mails and ordering viagra of the internet.
&gt;
&gt;It is apparently illegal to kill these people.
&gt; Although we read the 
&gt;Darwin Awards with glee when they choose to remove themselves from the 
&gt;gene pool of their own free will. So those of us who do IT support 
&gt;choose to bitch endlessly about them instead and with some
&gt;justification.

And it's much nicer than "ending" them :)

&gt;&gt; It's interesting to me this windy article is essentially a 'RTFM' 
&gt;&gt; argument.  I'm new to linux and I've seen this attitude is strong 
&gt;&gt; amongst the linux online community.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I feel it's one of the reasons many ppl evade linux.  Ultimately it's
&gt;&gt; about what you want to do with your time and effort.  Linux users
&gt;tend &gt; to be quite competant with computing because they spend the vast
&gt;amount &gt; of time learning all those details.  Mechanics, for example,
&gt;are good at &gt; their work because of their time and effort.  I wonder
&gt;if, for example, &gt;  'RTFM' Zealots read their car manuals thus evading
&gt;their mates wasting &gt; time fixing their stupid mistakes.

Yep :)
I fix tune etc my own beast..
Some of us like to know how things tick and some don't.
(that's all cool by me)
But you have a good point, to a point.

If I run up against something  I don't , can't understand I ask for
help. I try first, then I ask for help.

Trying to help somebody who has not tried first is usually a waste of
both peoples time. Though Linux man and info pages are "Culturally"
challenging at first so we should all cut real newbies a heap of slack.

 The worst are those who think Linux/BSD/their refrigerator should be
like something it's not... The very worst are those who wont understand
why they shouldn't reboot between installs  or even login :)

Conversely helping somebody who is willing to
keep an open mind, or give it a little time.. that's a joy. Nothing
quite like that spark of understanding ... you can even see it in an
email .

Then again I have also been guilty of the 
"Well if that hurts don't do that ! " reply.

Well back to abusing people ..
Pete
