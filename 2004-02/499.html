&gt; &gt; These guys are obviously insane.
&gt; Hmmm...  The thought has crossed EVERYONE in the Centre's (that I've spoken
&gt; to) mind - but then again, when an Organisation makes BILLIONS of dollars of
&gt; profit, and don't want to single handedly support the Federal Government in
&gt; tax - one has to do SOMETHING big to justify a smaller tax bill, right?
&gt; (It's the ONLY reason for doing something like this that my collegues and I
&gt; can come up with to even partially justify the downgrade)

first things first, _stop_ yelling. keep caps-lock use to a minimum, if at
all.
 
&gt; &gt; Or  have  internal communications blockages that
&gt; &gt; they are functionally so..
&gt; I think that also comes into play, though it disturbs me that the IT
&gt; Department SEEM (at least on the surface) to have dropped the ball so badly
&gt; on this one that it plainly stinks.

more oft the upper management get sold on something by some sales team
somewhere. Often management do not trust internal IT folks and talk to
external 'con-sultants'.

&gt; &gt; Or Mr Bennet or Mr Hacket or Ryan and David ...
&gt; &gt; Kim etc
&gt; These names at least I recognise...  Surely they'll respond after they've
&gt; read the posts?

You need to focus your efforts in the right direction.

I believe that an organisation such as Optus will not see the benifits
of Open Source on the desktop in the short term. Short term is the only
thing that management cares for. 

Open Source has best left its mark in the Infrastructure. Thats servers,
network, internet services (mail, web, instant messaging, databases, etc)

Cisco moved 1000 print servers to Linux in 2000 globally IIRR, 
saved $1M per year.

There has been a trend to middleware applications running on web servers
with db servers on the backend. These middle ware apps are often
Perl/PHP/Python apps talking to MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle.

Going middle ware server means the client desktop does not need to be a
hooj bloated windows desktop. A good web client  is all thats needed.
This is where the thin client was supposed to take over the world.

You can lock down the desktop and remove unecessary cruft, therefore
using less memory. Touch screeens make so much sense for POS terminals,
and a similar thing applies to sales desktop system i helped spec in
London. Cut down gnome desktop with a couple of keyboard shortcuts to
run a couple of apps like a web broswer, a print queue thingy,
login/logout, shortcut mozilla with a given URL for addressbooks, serach
etc..

setting these things up in the first place can be a bugger, but the
longer term IT support is less of a problem and Administration ca oft be
done remotely.

&gt; &gt; Have you tried tracking down the people doing the
&gt; &gt; gig at NSW Dept.Motor Transport ..? (There are
&gt; &gt; a few other department in NSW moving or moved
&gt; &gt; as well --some only as far as Sun and Staroffice ++ )
&gt; No, Didn't think to to be honest...  Not sure I have the authority to do so
&gt; to be honest.  After all, I'm not management - and I only work in Sales.
&gt; That said, I certainly am open to hear how that can help WITHOUT my getting
&gt; my butt dragged through the fire in doing so?

you need a couple of case studies to help leverage you point.

try the spanish government moving 8000 desktop to linux in 2002,
the german government you also mention, but you'll need timeframes for
conversion, growing pain info, re-training info and mid and long term
benifits. what their goals were and if they are similar/different

you will need to fit these goals very closely to your workplace and how
they fit/match other large organisations that already have undertaken
this... maybe "Beating Telstra to Open Source" might be a good thing =)

Open Source looks like it will be 13373 this year in government and big
business...

&gt; &gt; I should just forward your original post to the
&gt; &gt; AULinux list ..  May I ?
&gt; Absaloutly.  That was the whole reason I threw this into the Group - to get
&gt; enough help to give Optus the best chance possible.  I'm not stupid enough
&gt; to think I can have even a CHANCE of this without some signifgant help!!!

make notes. short ones. base each point on a case study and why open
source benifited the organisation, gained/lost for each.
what they would have done differently

&gt; &gt; You need to have a good understanding of what
&gt; &gt; drove the original, apparently retrograde decision
&gt; &gt; in the first place.. and blanket that with a "FLOSS"
&gt; &gt; solution.
&gt; Hmmm...  I'm not sure I'm in a position to be able to find this out to be
&gt; honest.  I can have a yack with our IT Dept here in Adelaide - but seeing as
&gt; they're not actually Optus employees - I'm not sure how far theat'll get me.

Think about how you could make you area/department more
efficient/productive with a new solution.

So you have to think about how it will effect you work flows for
particular teams and how to improve them. There is more than just
adoping open source...

but wait theres more! (than i have time for right now)

do you work in the city? maybe folks should have a lunch together
sometime and discuss.

cheers,
