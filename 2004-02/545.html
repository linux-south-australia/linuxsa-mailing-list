&gt; Hey all,
&gt;  
&gt; Thought I'd throw some thought-provoking questions onto the intellectual 
&gt; fire that is this mailing list.

The Fires of Hell you mean?


&gt;  
&gt; Following along from television series' such as Big Brother 
&gt; and Survivor, television stations seem to have jumped at the idea and 
&gt; introduced numerous new series' based on the reality television concept. 
&gt; Some people may say that it is going too far. Some, such as my 
&gt; high-school headmaster, go as far to say that the concept is evil and is 
&gt; contributing to the demise of human society. Others will just follow the 
&gt; crowd like the sheep that they are, and like and accept what the media 
&gt; dictates them to like and accept.
&gt;  
&gt; Was Australian Idol and the other Idol series' different to the Big 
&gt; Brother style of reality television? Does the fact that they have to be 
&gt; good at what they do to win the competition rather than to simply be 
&gt; accepted by the other "characters" on the television show make any 
&gt; difference?

WARNING: Rant buffer full.. dumping to email.

To me this is about the one-way commercial crap that is TV.  I find it 
difficult to tolerate much television.  Truly the boredom of it slowly 
spoon-feeding you crap is enough to make me want to scream.  I don't 
really understand why so many ppl can stare at it all day watching this. 
  It's full of fluff, you can see them drag out everything so the tiny 2 
mins of useful info or fun is drowned in the other 28 minutes of sheer 
rubbish.  Another replay, another plodding discussion, another pan to, 
another entrance another seas at 2 metres... and now *I'm* starting to 
get boring.

In my view 'reality' TV is just another extension of more 'games shows' 
as someone put it rather well, more tedious Days of Our Lives with 
'real' people trying as best they can, with more than ample help, to be 
more vapid, more nasty and more ugly than the torpid framefillers of 
such execrable shows.

The word 'reality' is so grossly misused but then I've never found the 
perfect definition for 'real' anyway.  It's 'real' for a lot of viewers, 
probably the same sort that click on spam promises for 'real' results 
but for me the reality of it falls away with the editing, the careful 
positioning and the dogma and B/S surrounding the whole thing.

Reality TV could have been a good thing... It *has* been a good thing... 
before it's ugly rebirth.  While documentaries have their limits of 
reality IMHO they represent a reasonable dose of realness whatever we 
might believe that to be.

I could drag this out into the reality of news, journalism and other 
media too but I think I'd better leave it just there.

Evil.  Snort.  Yes so basal a primate response as 'snort' cos that's all 
such crap deserves.  Probably one of the few things which annoys me more 
than reality shows are evangelistic people hiding behind 'authority' and 
'knowledge' excommunicating the evil heathens yonder which clash with 
their flawless views.

Just because I don't like something doesn't mean I seek to destroy it. 
I think that's an attitude that befits primates who might understand a 
good snort.  I prefer to change it instead or at least to face the 
possibility I'm dead wrong.

I believe emotion is the key, the more the love, nastiness, anger and 
tears the better the ratings.  Ppl gravitate to it because we want to 
*feel* it without actually putting ourselves under the same risk.  I 
wonder what that says about our courage.

Good at what you do is good at what you do.  Assuming here all the rules 
are above board..  if that's dancing and singing or social interaction 
who really cares?  About the only thing I liked about Idol was the 
winner wasn't pretty like so many pop idols we see today.  Maybe the 
audience is more mature than the presenters, who knows?  Isn't that 
glass half full stuff?

I hope maybe reality TV serves a purpose.  Perhaps it's helping us 
understand true human nature we've often covered over with naivety in 
the past.  Perhaps it's helping us understand the limits of people and 
the media.  It could even be giving us a chance to accept the ugly side 
of ourselves and let people channel their spite in a better way.  I sure 
hope we're getting something out of it cos those hours spent by all 
those people would be quite a pile of waste otherwise.

Maybe we'll all wake up one day and put as much attention into the 
people actually involved in this little game show we call 'reality'.

Thanks for the interesting material

Aaron
&gt;  
&gt; Is it going too far? Do we really care what these people think and do? 
&gt; Do we want to watch humans fall to such low standards as they turn 
&gt; against each other to succeed at whatever it is they are supposed to be 
&gt; succeeding at?
&gt;  
&gt; Is there anything else that anyone wants to bring up? What are your own 
&gt; thoughts on reality television?
&gt;  
&gt; I look forward to reading your responses, and to partaking in the 
&gt; discussion that follows.
&gt;  
&gt; - Adam
