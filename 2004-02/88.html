Bearing in mind that I agree with you, I would also note that this is really
a nicely expressed explanation of the primary barrier in front of Linux
distributions taking a huge stake in the desktop space. And of course you
can add even more choices by folding in other 'Unixes' (*BSD for various
values of '*' etc) as potential answers.

None of those mythical 'typical home users' want to give a damn about any of
the below. They just want to know why they would want to have "Linux" rather
than "Windows", and forcing them to somehow answer that sort of '20
questions' game will just cause them to wander back off to their windows box
and get on with the third reinstall this year to stop their box crashing
strangely again - something they have trained themselves to believe is
'normal'.

Deep down, this sort of freedom of choice is both the blessing, and the
curse, of Open Source operating systems. No doubt that the nett effect is
hugely, hugely positive in the world - choice intrinsically increases the
chances of someone finding a more optimal solution to the challenge in their
life that they are looking to solve. But the collateral damage is the layer
of 'dazed and confused' people, one layer 'out', who just don't get why it
isn't just "Linux".

And of course, everyone wants 'their' Linux to become 'the' Linux.

The powerful stuff happens when enough of them get over it and join forces.
This has recently happened in the anti-spam world (<A HREF="http://spf.pobox.com">http://spf.pobox.com</A>) and
the implications there of multiple previously competing camps of folk
solving the same problem in the smtp sender-authentication space are huge.
As they also are in the Linux space.

(Yes, none of this is news to any of you, I know - but its just such a stark
and great example of the nature of the challenge that I felt it was worth
comment)

Cheers,
Simon

&gt; Errrr, not quite. I would say that there is a huge difference between
&gt; advising someone to install Mandrake vs Slack. The range of software with
&gt; the default install, the preponderance for a distro to have GUI
&gt; configuration tools or insist you use the CLI, range of support for
&gt; hardware, etc. are all valid concerns which differ markedly from distro to
&gt; distro. I mean, if you're talking about RH vs Mdk well fine but in Deb vs
&gt; SUSE or Gentoo vs Lindows, the differences are HUGE. For example, if someone
&gt; said that they didn't have much time to bugger around, I'd hardly tell them
&gt; to attempt to compile and install Gentoo, would I?

&gt; 
&gt; That's easy.  It doesn't really matter.  They're all good, and in fact
&gt; they're 99% identical.  Pick the one with the cutest logo, or the most
&gt; interesting name, and learn that one.
