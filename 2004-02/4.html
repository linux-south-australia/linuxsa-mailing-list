Hi folks,

OK, it's not *quite* as nice as Geoffrey's new server :-)

The full specs are here:

<A HREF="http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/servers/proliant1600/index1.html">http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/servers/proliant1600/index1.html</A>

The differences between what's listed there and this system are:

o 256Mb of RAM
o 300 Mhz CPU
o Extra 9Gb hot swap drive
o Extra 18Gb fixed SCSI drive

I have the two stock 4.5Gb SCSI drives, but I removed them. The appear
to work OK, but they are noisy ('would you like some cheese with that
whine?'), but I'll throw them in.

In summary:

o 300Mhz Pentium II
o 256Mb ECC RAM
o On board 10/100 TX UTP ethernet
o Two Integrated Wide-Ultra SCSI-3 Controllers
o 2 x 9Gb SCSI hot swap drives
o 18Gb fixed SCSI drive
o Two 4.5Gb SCSI  (removed)
o CD-ROM

This system was my home server system until a month ago. It's been
running FreeBSD flawlessly for the last 9 months or so. I'm sure it'll
run Linux just as well.

There's a couple of minor caveats with this system:

o The Proliant is noisy

Not loud like some server systems, you could sit next to it and carry on 
a phone conversation without trouble. But it's not quiet.

o It doesn't handle IDE well

You can use IDE drives with it, I was. But its got a single channel
that's designed for running the CDROM drive. It *will not* boot an IDE
hard disk.

o It's big and heavy

Even if the onboard graphics were up to it, you wouldn't want to 
take this to a LAN party :-)

And just to sweeten the deal, you get a free entire extra chassis,
sans hard disks and hot swap caddy (since it is now in this system).
If you're willing to split the drives, you get two systems for the
price of one! Note that I have not tested the other system, though it
was taken from the same working environment as the first. It's
provided as-is.

No operating system is provided. I can pre-install FreeBSD if it makes
you happy :-)

Best offer before COB Wednesday 4th of Febraury takes the lot.

I'm not splitting the units or components.

	- Justin
