&gt; &gt; Option is to recieve message in sms or mms, standard 25c/75c charge

&gt; &gt; address for the mobile is  <A HREF="mailto:mobilenumber@optusmobile.com.au">mobilenumber@optusmobile.com.au</A>
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; e.g. <A HREF="mailto:0411123456@optusmobile.com.au">0411123456@optusmobile.com.au</A>
&gt;
&gt; Another option (if you can figgure out a way to make the following
&gt; programme run on your Linux distro) is to install the ICQ programme (
&gt; www.icq.com ) and send all SMS messages to phones on any network (Optus,
&gt; Telstra, Voda and Etc) anywhere in Australia, absaloutly ***FREE***.  (ICQ
&gt; allows you to send ICQ's, E-Mail's and SMS's directly from your desktop.)
&gt;
&gt; My thinking is that IF you can figgure out how to port the programme to
&gt; your Linux distro then you'll escape the cost of sending E-Mail's...
&gt; (Particularly usefull if you're going to be sending a few on a regular
&gt; basis.)  Now... That said, it's only 160 charrachters you can send in each
&gt; ICQ - so after writing your E-Mail, you'll have to cut and paste it into
&gt; ALOT of seperate ICQ's.  Consequently, I guess it just depends on whether a
&gt; free method that takes time is better (to you) than a pay per each use
&gt; method that is quick...
&gt;
&gt; If you have no way of installing ICQ onto your system and can't afford
&gt; whatever programme the list can suggest to make it work - you're also in
&gt; luck if you own any of the following handheld platforms that you can
&gt; connect to your Linux box in some way, because the following handheld
&gt; formats have ICQ versions ready to go for immediate install...  They
&gt; include: Palm m515, m500, 505; Visor Handspring, Sony Clie, Compaq iPaq,
&gt; Casio Cassiopeia or a HP Jornada 568.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps!!!

for what it's worth, kopete is supposed to be able to send SMS via ICQ... I've 
tried it and it gave a message that the carrier was unable to deliver... I 
then tried on ICQ's web-based SMS sending page (need to log in, and still 
about 10/day limit) and it didn't go through from there either. I'm with 
prepaid yes optus and it's worked in the past, so I'm guessing it's a 
temporary problem.
a number of the other ICQ clients that work on linux (or even windows if you 
want to wine them) would most likely also support SMS to ICQ-happy networks
