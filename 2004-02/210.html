&gt; Looking for some network monitoring tools to lookup cisco routers for

&gt; 
&gt; Would love to use a knoppix style CD that I can pop into a pC at one of our
&gt; sites and log stuff to my USB key.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried downloading:
&gt; 
&gt; Echelon
&gt; Knoppix STD
&gt; and L.A.S
&gt; 
&gt; but unfortunately they all either didnt boot or complained they couldnt find
&gt; the knoppix file system..  They were looking towards /dev/scd0... Is that an
&gt; attempt at looking at a SCSI drive??  I dont have any SCSI cards in my
&gt; system or is it just an ATAPI emulation of SCSI???
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas on applicable packages or solutions to the knoppix filesystem
&gt; issue very much welcome..

IIRR, most usbkeys/memory/disk/storage/pendrives are accessed as scsi
devices, such as /dev/sda1 and are often formated as type vfat.

you will have to have a kernel with atapi scsi emulation, usb and
usbstorage compiled as modules ... well thats how mine now works =)

i broke my knoppix CD so i'll have to make another and give it a go =)

its possible you could use a standard knoppix disk and have your
network monitoring code and data on the usbkey...

that would be easier than modifying a knoppix install, burning, testing,
repeat...

cheers,
