Mozilla 1.5 takes about 2.5s to appear on my machine with a blank home
page after it has been run once to cache everything. I only have
Navigator and Composer, not email in it (debian package mozilla-browser
1.5-3). I don't have psm or xft either.

2G Celeron Notebook, 2.6.1 kernel (with mm patches), Debian Unstable. 
This is a very ordinary sub $2000 notebook not a desktop rocket.

About 1.8s is user, 0.16 system (very roughly)

Not unbearable.

I ran it with strace but nothing useful to report. It didn't seem to be
held up anywere noticeable.

Just apt-getting mozilla-mailnews which is also updating my mozilla
browser and a heap of other stuff...looks to be 1.6 now...

Try again. Feels slightly slower but it still is well under 3 seconds 
and closer to 2.5s.

&gt; Run strace on mozilla and see what it's waiting for. Like Daryl said, 
&gt; sounds like it's hanging on something.
&gt; 
&gt; If there's no disk activity during the pause, it doesn't sound like an 
&gt; I/O issue. For reference, I just fired up Mozilla on my Gentoo box and 
&gt; the drive light was solid until it came up.
