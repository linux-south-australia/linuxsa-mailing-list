Hi Allan,

&gt; don't remember a time without matric.
&gt;
Matric was introduced (at my school anyway) in 1969, my last year. At 
that time country schools (maybe city schools too??) had two streams of 
study, Area or PEB. Area was the curriculum decided by the school 
according to local needs so as we were a country school (Yankalilla) it 
had a high Agriculture component. PEB (Public Education Board) being 
the forerunner of the SABSA whatever they call themselves and the 
curriculum was set by them and applied across the State Education Dept. 
So Matric was open only to PEB students not Area students. I got my 
Leaving Area Certificate and that was the end of my schooling at the 
time.

&gt; though they (& the author) sound familiar.
&gt;
They are both based on Cassandra Kresnov, a non-organic human female 
developed as a fighting machine but through having the ability to think 
laterally develops a distaste for war so escapes to the other side and 
tries to hide her abilities and live a 'normal' life.
(See below for book info)

Wonder which bookshop he works for? Does he use Linux?

&gt; Did you get my message re: Ram for that old laptop (the one you only 
&gt; had 6MB for)?
&gt;
Umm, sorry, don't recall hearing about it. That must have been for the 
Packard Bell Statesman. Damn thing has locked up and wont boot.

Cant get rid of it, it has signatures of Linus and Bdale on the cover!
Glad we found something related to LinuxSA ... I was expecting DSL to 
start bleating about OT real soon &lt;G,D&RVF&gt;

 Cheers,
 Ian

A young woman is on the run, and on her own. She needs to find work and 
a place to live... she needs to feel like an ordinary human being. 

But she is no ordinary human being - and when she saves the life of 
Katia Neiland, President of Tanusha, the secret services discover just 
how special, just how lethal, she is. 

Who can she trust? Vanessa Rice, special forces, who wants to be her 
friend? The President? The Judiciary? Whoever it is she's better decide 
soon. Those she left behind want her back. The League's Dark Star is a 
ruthless organisation, and some people in the Federation wouldn't mind 
handing her over - or causing war... 

Will she ever find safety? Can she ever stop running?
