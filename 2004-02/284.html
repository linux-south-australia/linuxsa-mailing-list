&gt;&gt; It looks like the group had a brief sojourn writing a CVS "replacement"

&gt;&gt; recently, so once I have opencm up and running I'll give it another
&gt;&gt; whirl, and may actually contribute something to it.  I think it
&gt;&gt; shows a lot of promise if it can get a sufficient critical mass of
&gt;&gt; Open Source enthusiasts.

Ah.  My original "support" comments were directed at EROS, but opencm
could probably do with some support as well.  They admit they have some
performace issues with certain operations, and as yet don't support
disconnected operations (which is the pricipal reason I was looking at
it, alas), but the fine grained authentication and the use of
certificates for authorisation interested me.

They also made the following comment:  "The Perforce system is a
commercial product, but is licensed at no charge for use on open source
projects. To all appearances, Perforce is a good product, but we have
commercial collaborators and a need to manage open but unreleased code.
The Perforce license does not support this.", which they didn't detail
any further than that.
