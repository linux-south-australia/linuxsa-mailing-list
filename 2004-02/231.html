Internode's support is really good, the 2 or 3 times I've needed to call
them I've received good prompt service..  

But don't bother sending email to their sales team.. I don't think there
is one..

I've sent maybe 10 emails to <A HREF="mailto:sales@internode.on.net">sales@internode.on.net</A> over the last year
or so and I think the quickest response time to my initial enquiry was
13 days. Some of them I'm still waiting for.

I've sent 2 emails earlier this week so I'll expect I might get a
response towards the end of next week.

Maybe the auto-responder thinks it is the sales team and it keeping
them.. :)


Cheers,
Darryl

&gt; I'd recommend Internode for this scenario.  Indeed, I've also heard a 
&gt; lot of people say that the support has gone down the drain, which is a

&gt; shame - they're a great company.  :-(
&gt; 

For the record - I've heard a lot of people (mostly our paying
customers) say the opposite - that our support quality is consistently
improving over time, and that its generally great. In particular we
receive a lot of unsolicited mail from our customers saying the exact
opposite to the above.

Now this is a classic case of the old chestnut: If you like &lt;x&gt;, please
tell your friends, if you don't, please tell us.

And seriously: We don't (ever) claim perfection, but we do continue to
strive for it. 

If you could just ask that 'lot of people' you know to simply tell us
what happened (via email to <A HREF="mailto:feedback@internode.on.net">feedback@internode.on.net</A>) then our senior
management team will do their level best to fix it. Every time I've had
this sort of assertion, and dug in to it, we've resolved it
satisfactorily in the presence of an actual complaint, not hearsay.
Hearsay is really hard to respond to.

No company whose reputation is built on great support (as ours is)
enjoys hearing that sort of generalisation without knowing enough
details to do something about it.

As the person who started, and still runs, Internode, I take this sort
of thing very personally - and I sincerely mean what I'm saying about
wanting to understand and fix any instance of a customer feeling that
their support experience hasn't been what they needed it to be.

We have, sincerely, put -enormous- resources into our support teams and
support mechanisms over time, and those resources are only on the rise;
We really, really value feedback to <A HREF="mailto:feedback@internode.on.net">feedback@internode.on.net</A> telling us
what sort of job we're doing, so we can do a better one. Really.

In terms of actual statistics on this sort of thing, just to underscore
my point here, take a look at the recently released independent survey
about broadband services published by APC magazine this month (Feb
2004), and based on a survey of Whirlpool users late last year.

In that survey, this is how customers surveyed rated their ISP on
service:

Westnet 97%
Internode 93%
Swiftel 84%
IiNet 79%
DART 77%
Netspace 67%
OptusNet 55%
Datafast 36%
TPG 33%
Bigpond ADSL: 24%
Bigpond Cable: 21%

(the table lists ISPs who received more than 100 responses from
customers of that ISP - total sample size &gt; 10,000).

Many other interesting stats in the same issue.

I'd love nothing more than to bring our percentage even higher, by
improving our services even more. That simply needs us to receive direct
feedback on any cases in which we didn't deliver enough hugs. We are
genuinely interested in them. The folk at Internode, many of whom have
been actively supporting the Linux community for a very long time, do
this for love at least as much as they do this for money. No kidding.

(And besides: Which other ISP do you know that paid to have Linus
dunked?)

That is my $0.02 worth, anyway. Thanks for listening.

 Simon Hackett
