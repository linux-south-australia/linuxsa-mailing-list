Um , everything I mentioned previously about logging straight into X is
a filthy lie.

Those scripts that I posted before only half work.

Its now 3am, and Im pleased to report that the new method works 100% of
the time, and is much faster than using XDM.

Basically, any attempt to shell script your way out of it is doomed to
failure. I did not fully understand how low level everything is whilst
the machine is chugging through the init process, prior to the login
prompt. XDM actually does a lot of work connecting the output of
processes to character devices such as /dev/console, and during init you
are in a state where the tty command returns 'not a tty', so you cant
just run startx back here. This is a job that calls for some sneaky C
code.

You need to adopt the attitude that regular Linux, especially such
things as RedHat, are like mass-market cars. Powerful, stylish, quiet,
comfortable, with big bouncy suspensions on them, so that can be used
for a variety of purposes. I wont even attempt to describe where Windows
fits into this analogy. Maybe an STA bus that is never running on time ?
(Where do you want to go today ? asks the bus driver, like I have a
choice about where the bus is going ? - Hey, if its not too much trouble
Mr bus driver, howzabout you drop me off right out the front of .. oh
never mind)

A kiosk / dedicated app / turnkey solution  linux machine on the other
hand is a racing car - we need to throw out anything that is there for
comfort only, chop the panels down, harden the suspension, drop in a
roll cage and generally push everything to the limit just so it can go
an extra 1/10th of a second faster per lap around a specific track. When
it comes time to tackle the next track, we just build another car from
scratch. 

--------------------------
Getting straight to X as fast as you can ..

Its a PITA - but here is what you need to do :

1) Get a copy of autologin - 3k tarball of source code that is built for
redhat systems.

2) Strip out all the guff that uses PAM, since a stripped down distro
wont have PAM (again, less dependencies is a good thing). Strip out the
code related to utmp updates (since there is a 1:1 relationship between
booting and logins, we dont care about login history), and then minimize
the Makefile so that it does not need any libs at all.(-lpam -lutmp -dl
can all go)

3) Stick it straight into inittab as a respawn'ed task

A bare /etc/inittab such as this :
# Runlevel 3 - Straight into X with zero overhead
id:3:initdefault
i3:3:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc.3
x3:3:respawn /sbin/autologin username startx

the /etc/rc.d/rc.3 script fires off any processes that you need. If
there are things such as starting up SQL servers, then you can use the &
thingy in the rc.3 script to run them in the background, so the script
returns immediately, and then X starts immediately.  Hopefully, the
backgrounded commands have completed before the user types in their
password.  

Also, because your machine is just going to run a dedicated task, you
dont need all that extra guff to load functions, check arguments, issue
stops and statuses - just a few clean commands to fire up what you need
is all you want in these init scripts.

Note the total lack of anything else - you cannot ctrl-alt-del the
thing, and you cannot Ctrl-Alt-F[1-10] to get a text console. All nice
and lightweight, and immune to prying fingers on the keyboard.

There is no runlevel 6, so the beast cannot be shutdown via the shutdown
command.

During bootup, it completely bypasses all of the normal rc scripts, and
so it is way fast.


----------
For shutting the system down, I use a modified version of jwz's
fastboot.c program available from his DNA lounge site - it tells
postgresql to close up, syncs the disks, and goes straight for the
kernel level power off function.   Powerdown safely in 2 seconds flat on
any old pentium.

--------------------------

Now, the slowest part of the boot process is loading the linux kernel
and doing stage1 hardware detection. Since the rest is so fast now, that
hardware detection is getting annoying. Given that the hardware of the
kiosk is not going to change, I reckon it must be possible to bypass all
that as well .. any ideas ?

Surely, something like lilo can load the kernel as it normally does, but
then the kernel should be able to just init itself from a snapshot and
skip all the hardware checks. I think linuxbios manages something like
this (they flash the ROM bios with a tiny linux kernel so you go from
powerup to login prompt in under 5 seconds).

Anyone had any success with LinuxBios ??
