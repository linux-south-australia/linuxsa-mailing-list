David,

&gt; &gt; Has anybody else had problems over the past couple of months with any
&gt; &gt; unsolicited email?
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome to the big bad internet.  It's a dangerous place and people do
&gt; nasty things.

As a way of getting around this, there's a few choices that I have:

 1. Adam Internet do run an anti-spam tool at Adam
    - however it plays havoc with some of the mailing lists I'm on and
      accidentally throws me off them by bouncing spams coming via those
      mailing lists

 2. Spamassassin locally
    - this is very effective
    - it is actually quite resource intensive but provided I spread my
      download of e-mails it's OK
      [I get something like 1000-1500 e-mails per day, 200 of which *are*
       spam; spamassassin is quite I/O intensive more than anything else]

 3. Clamav (a free virus scanner) locally
    - this is effective however I generally don't use it unless I can't
      convince Spamassassin to trigger spam mail

Of all things, I've found that doubling Spamassassin's default values for:

 HTML e-mail
 Microsoft e-mail
 Microsoft attachments

...generally throws ALL the Microsoft virii into the bin. Admittedly MyDoom
(I think - the one that seems to have a series of random dictionary words)
got past my Spamassassin for quite a while until I managed to get the bayes
filtering to recognise it.

Naturally, I remember you discussing with me before off list how you found
it annoying that as an ISP owner you and in turn your customers had to wear
the cost of downloading all of this rubbish that neither wanted. I get
annoyed too because at the end of the day it *could* cost me extra in fees,
reduced speed and such.

*sigh*

At the end of the day, I add this to what you've already said: 1,2 or 3 is
only a small amount. I get about 200 unsolicited e-mails per day.
