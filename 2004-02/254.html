&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm just introducing myself to this mailing list.  Feel free to let the 
&gt; eyes glaze over and reach for the delete key if you like.  This is 
&gt; almost a novelty as I haven't used a mailing list in years.  Naturally I 
&gt; have questions but I think an introduction and a bit of watching would 
&gt; be a good idea right now.  So hello to you all.

welcome:) dont feed david lloyd, he bites, and dont get him wet. unless
at lca:)

seriously, nice intro - wish more did that.

&gt; 
&gt; I found your list via the main linuxSA web site.  I googled to get the 
&gt; website :)

its always interesting to hear how we are found...

&gt; I am a true newbie to linux.  I really have very little understanding of 
&gt; it and only typed the odd 'ls' command on unix university systems years 
&gt; ago.  I'm a Microsftophile really or rather, was one.  You could say I'm 
&gt; converting.. or trying to.  I'm also from SA which is probably obvious 
&gt; when joining a LinuxSA mailing list, I guess.


actually, we have members from o/s too, which is nice:)

&gt; I have a lone WindowsXP system I desire to get Linux working on with a 
&gt; dual boot arrangement.  I've been looking here there and everywhere 
&gt; about it.  I decided to go with Mandrake 9.2 for it's reputably good 
&gt; installation and hardware detection and popularity in case I have gnarly 
&gt; questions.  I even have the disks now.  I have a raid0 arrangement and 
&gt; telstra Cable both of which seem to be problem areas for installation, 
&gt; the raid being a real killer for a newbie like me.

mandrake (i think) and fedora both have prewtty gui installers which
deal with lvm/raid afaik...

and any probs can be bought to the group:)

also, when in doubt, attend a linuxsa meeting, and bring the beasty
along, someone will help you through. or send out an sos, someone
usually offers to turn up for coffee:)

&gt; I've ironed out most of my software fears.  There seems to be ways 
&gt; around my commonly used WinXP/MS programs using Linux versions instead 
&gt; for almost everything.  Well, except for games and even there there's 
&gt; some which work one way or the other.


i ran diablo II and baldurs gate II under transgamings winex (free with
cvs version, else licence)..on a pII300 compaq laptop with 4mb video
card. i like doing stupid things:))

there are actually many games like civilisation ported to linux, and
heaps of free games for kde/gnome and beyond.

&gt; My limited experience with Linux so far has been trying the run-on-a-CD 
&gt; distro Knoppix 3.3.  I was quite impressed.  In terms of usability and 
&gt; the GUI Linux won't be any problem for most newbies I'd say.


hehe knopppix is sweet - i installe dit to my hdd as the lazy persons
debian install (tm).

love debian:) (ok, im being siren called by freebsd, but thats another
story)

&gt; I have some free advice too.  Imagine that, advice from a newbie!  You 
&gt; say on the linuxSA website one of your goals is for promotion.  I can 
&gt; help with that, at least for newbies and probably for others as well. 
&gt; The main linux.org website has a groups section here;
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.linux.org/groups/index.html">http://www.linux.org/groups/index.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Your linuxSA site is not listed (under Australia).  Quite a few people 
&gt; refer to the address above and so I'm positive a listing would help.

good info - 
attention geoffrey bennett:) 

pop into irc sometime if so inclined. just dont feed david if hes there.
