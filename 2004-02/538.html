It is a good point that these shows really are just game shows. However, I
was referring to them as "reality TV" simply because that is what they have
become known as.

It is also true that censorship has a part to play, and the editors make the
footage tell the story that they want it to.

&gt;  &gt; Is it going too far? Do we really care what these people think and do?
&gt;  &gt; Do we want to watch humans fall to such low standards as they turn
&gt;  &gt; against each other to succeed at whatever it is they are supposed to
&gt;  &gt; be succeeding at?
&gt;
&gt; Don't think of them as "Reality TV" -- because they plainly aren't real.
&gt;
&gt; Do you seriously think that Big Brother's producer doesn't control your
&gt; perception of the contestants by cleverly choosing the 3 minutes (out of
&gt; the last 24 hours) worth of footage you're going to see each person
&gt; featuring in during the nightly broadcast?
&gt;
&gt; Do you really think it was a big shock worthy of a New Idea when one of
&gt; the original Pop Stars contestants was kicked out for stealing?  Was it
&gt; *still* worthy when you think about the fact that it was all filmed
&gt; six months before it aired, so everyone concerned knew it had happened
&gt; before the series even reached TV, but they all carried out the first two
&gt; months of the series pretending that the kicked-out contestant still had
&gt; a chance?
&gt;
&gt; So it isn't Reality TV.  So what is it?
&gt;
&gt; Game shows.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, game shows.  Only you can't call them game shows, because everyone's
&gt; too hip to watch them.  So you call them reality TV instead.  But they're
&gt; still game shows.
&gt;
&gt; There isn't a lot of difference between the emotional highs and lows
&gt; that are felt in those shows versus the emotional highs and lows felt
&gt; by a gibbering, giggling hearts-a-flutter "New Price Is Right" audience
&gt; member who has just been told to "come on down."  It's all the same.
&gt;
&gt; With one small detail of difference:  Have you noticed how DULL those
&gt; shows are?  My girlfriend watched the last series of The Bachelor -- DULL!
&gt; Sooooo maaaaaany reeeeeeaally looooong, sloooooow shots of people walking
&gt; about from place to place, or looking at each other across a room crowded
&gt; with other people doing exactly the same thing.  I sat with her one night
&gt; and watched an episode;  I swear I could feel my brain atrophying between
&gt; the commercials.  Oh my god!
