&gt; Hi again,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm just after some last thoughts before I wipe Microsoft from my Private
&gt; LAN forever.  As I'm writing this, I'm in the process of downloading
&gt; Mandrake 9.2...  (That said, I've already got Redhat 9.)
&gt; 
&gt; Seeing as I'm still in the larva stage of Linux skills, I think it'd be wise
&gt; to install _one_ version across all 4 of my existing boxes (as opposed to
&gt; different versions on each) to make maintanence/upkeep easier (for me) so my
&gt; question is this:

Not necessarily. If you have a fast link like dsl then keeping both Redhat and Mandrake up to date is simply a matter of reading the man pages for up2date (for redhat) and urpmi (for mandrake) which are the tools for automating the installs of any errata updates that may be released from time to time. Of course you can do that on dialup too (like I do) but it gets painfully slow for several boxes on a lan.

&gt; 
&gt; In the expert opinions of those that have 'played' with these distro's for
&gt; more years than I've been aware that Linux even existed - what is the
&gt; easiest to learn on as well as keep up to date?  Mandrake or Redhat?

IMHO and I've only been playing with linux for 8.5 years, both Mandrake and Redhat are pretty much the same as far as complexity. They both have lots of gui admin tools so you can be productive immediately and take your time learning more about linux and command line tools.

As far as what you want to do with your network, I'd actually suggest fedora, as nearly everything you describe as "requirements", comes standard with fedora, or fedora versions can be found easily. Fedora is in reality "the next generation" of Redhat. It's also an excellent choice for newbies and is probably the most windows-like distribution.

Fedora also has excellent hardware detection and support, and ships with about 1700+ applications including web servers, mail servers, desktop office suites, games and much much more. But then again, so does every distribution, just some have more than others.

&gt; 
&gt; My googeling has led me to believe that although Redhat seems to be slightly
&gt; ahead in popularity, that lead is decreasing by leaps and bounds as time
&gt; goes by.
&gt; 
&gt; What do I want to do with these distros will probably come into it - so just
&gt; a brief summary:
&gt; 
&gt; (1) Everyone knows what I want to do with the boys PC so I won't bother
&gt; recapping that one except to add that I will want to add 'Wine' and 'WineX'
&gt; to enable the box to run the boys PC games - as well as following Romana's
&gt; advice about putting  'gcompris' on. :-)

This plan is fine as they're still quite young and gcompris is a good educational suite. But as they grow older peer pressure from their friends may make them wish they had windows so they can play the same games. Have you considered dual booting both linux and windows for the kids?  It can default to booting either OS as you choose.

&gt; 
&gt; (2) The lounge box will be a minimal install that will be banned from the
&gt; Net all together. (Its sole purpose 'in life' is to interface with our
&gt; TV/Stereo to play games, TV Eps and Movies - nothing else.)

You will want to look at mplayer, xine, ogle and xmms for this box.

&gt; 
&gt; (3) My wife's computer box (Do I still call them PC's once their Windows
&gt; days are ended?) will be trickier, seeing as she only uses it to send
&gt; E-Mail's, Occasionally
&gt; surf the web and play Solitaire...  Accordingly, it's 'lot' in life is to
&gt; act as a file server to serve everything to the rest of the Network.
&gt; 
&gt; However - so I don't get a hard time - it'll also need to have everything a
&gt; decent Windows install does. (Office, Web, E-Mail, ICQ, Messenger and etc)
&gt; Hardware is P4 - 1.76GHz, Matrox G450 (dual) 2x 17" monitors, CD-RW, DVD,
&gt; 3COM NIC, Onboard AC3 Sound and 512MB SD-RAM.
&gt; 
&gt; (4) My box is an AMD XP2100, Matrox G400 Max (dual) 2x 17" monitors, CD-RW,
&gt; DVD, 3COM NIC, Audigy Pro, 1GB DDR-RAM, USB 2.0 card added for 4x extra USB
&gt; ports as well as a Hauhpage TV-IN/OUT and a Firewire card.  I'll proably be
&gt; running a dual boot system on mine as I have to have access to stuff I'm not
&gt; sure (yet) are ported or will run properly in Wine (Photoshop, Dreamweaver
&gt; MX '04, Pinnacle software and etc)

You may want to consider VMWare so you can run both OS's at once although using linux as the host OS is my preference.

&gt; 
&gt; Those are our present needs.  Pretty basic and simple to start off with.  As
&gt; to the future, *eventually* I'd like to set up a server farm (For editing)
&gt; as well as running an Apache Server complete with Proxy Server, Firewall and
&gt; Etc (As a seperate box/boxes) but that won't be until later in the year at
&gt; least...  For now, it's all standard humdrum - with the exception of my
&gt; system, and setting up the little ladies as a Server.
&gt; 
&gt; 3 of 4 need to be able to access E-Mail, the Web and the Printer (hooked
&gt; into my box atm - as it doesn't have a network card) With the obvious
&gt; exception of the printer, all are plugged into a 8 port Switch - which is
&gt; plugged into my ADSL.  Oh, and all 4 will need to access the file(s) that're
&gt; sharing the TV Eps, Movies Etc as well as our music folder (We digitised all
&gt; our music and put the CD's away to keep them from the wrath of our 1 year
&gt; old)  LOL
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts on whether Mandrake or Redhat will be better (for my needs)
&gt; when it comes to ease of use, ease of installation of extra programs as well
&gt; as ease of maintanance?

Fedora ships with up2date and yum, although you can also install apt-get, giving you 3 choices of automated package management tools, as well as the synaptic gui frontend for apt allowing you to visually browse all the various package trees. It also promises to provide more cutting edge package releases than earlier versions of redhat with major releases every 4 to 6 months.

Basically, everything you need/want can be be answered by fedora (or Mandrake), but it finally just comes down to "your call". Any linux distribution can too.
