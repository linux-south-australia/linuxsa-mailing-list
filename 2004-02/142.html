 Red Hat, Seagate, Sun Microsystems, and Lindows.com Sponsor
 Desktop Linux Summit 2004

 Registration Now Open for Second Annual Event, Attendance
 Expected to Grow 100%

 SAN DIEGO, February 3, 2004 -- Top industry leaders have signed
 on as sponsors of Desktop Linux Summit 2004
 (www.desktoplinuxsummit.org), the second annual event that
 focuses exclusively on Linux on the desktop.  Red Hat (Nasdaq:
 RHAT), Seagate (NYSE: STX), Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW), and
 Lindows.com (www.lindows.com)  have confirmed their support for
 the event.  Sponsors, exhibitors, and attendees are encouraged to
 sign up (www.desktoplinuxsummit.org) to reserve their spot at
 desktop Linux's premier event, to be held in April in San Diego,
 California.

 Taking place on the prestigious Del Mar Fairgrounds, Desktop
 Linux Summit 2004 will be held from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on
 April 22 and 23, 2004. Desktop Linux Summit 2003 accommodated 600
 participants, and sold out almost a month before the actual
 event.  Anticipating unparalleled interest in the growing desktop
 Linux movement, this year's venue will accommodate twice that,
 with the number of both exhibitors and attendees expected to
 double from last year. 

 Exhibiting at the 2004 Desktop Linux Summit is a unique selling
 opportunity, and an ideal setting for companies to network with
 entities involved with desktop Linux on any level. The Summit is
 the largest conference dedicated exclusively to Linux on desktop
 computers, and substantial coverage from media reporting to all
 corners of the world will be present.   Companies are able to get
 their message to key decision-makers across a wide variety of
 industries in a cost-effective manner. 

 Attendees will meet with heavyweights and promising start-ups,
 learning all aspects of the desktop Linux movement and gaining
 unique insights from experts in the industry.  Decision-makers
 will find the event invaluable for learning about the benefits of
 desktop Linux, while others will take advantage of the unique
 learning opportunity.  Speaker presentations, panels, and
 extensive Q&A sessions will deepen understanding of revolutionary
 technologies, while an extensive exhibit hall will offer the
 chance to become familiar with the leading names in desktop
 Linux.  Registration is now open at www.desktoplinuxsummit.org. 

 "Red Hat has achieved great success in the enterprise server
 market.  The next step is to create a compelling client solution
 that works well within the enterprise infrastructure," said John
 Young, vice president of marketing at Red Hat.
 "Interoperability, management and security will be the key areas
 of focus for a Red Hat enterprise desktop solution."

 "Seagate is strongly committed to bringing our channel customers
 the new technologies that are changing the face of computing,"
 said Joe Cousins, Seagate Senior Director of Global Channel
 Marketing. "Desktop Linux Summit 2004 is an essential opportunity
 to help shape the future of Linux on the desktop."

 "Never before have we seen such worldwide enthusiasm for Linux
 desktop solutions like the Java Desktop System.  When you have
 entire countries signing up, such as China and the United
 Kingdom, that's one rousing endorsement of the Linux desktop
 space," said Peder Ulander, director of Desktop Solutions, Sun
 Microsystems, Inc. "The wait is over; the timing is right.
 Businesses now have viable enterprise-grade Linux desktop
 solutions with complete support services, management tools, a
 dedicated developer base and industrial-grade developer tools."

 "Given the amazing success of Linux elsewhere, there's increasing
 interest in Linux next taking on Microsoft Windows on the client.
 It won't  'just happen,'" said Illuminata Inc. Senior Analyst
 Gordon Haff.  "Major vendors and users will have to make a
 concerted push to get Linux accepted as a mainstream desktop
 choice. But if they can together help Linux to reach critical
 mass, its potential on the desktop is as great as on the server."

 "Economics are compelling computer users to seek out new
 opportunities with Linux on the desktop," said Michael Robertson,
 chief executive officer and founder of Lindows.com Inc. "Last
 year at Desktop Linux Summit 2003, we were on the doorstep of a
 major movement; this year desktop Linux is here. The technology
 is here. Desktop Linux Summit will connect that technology with
 consumers who are looking for quality, value and want to learn
 about the thousands of desktop Linux applications available."
