&gt; &gt; Erm, 1000baseTX full-duplex, even.  10MB/sec would be good @ the lower 
&gt; &gt; speed, but unfortunately for this, it isn't *quite* enough juice.
&gt; 
&gt; And just to follow up myself again, that 10MB/sec was a once off, I 
&gt; think - I'm getting averages of around 5MB/sec, which is what I would 
&gt; expect for 100baseTX.  Cards are definitely running at 1000baseTX 
&gt; full-duplex, though.
&gt; 
&gt; What kind of speeds should I expect?
&gt; 
&gt; I know that the G5 isn't a bottleneck as it's also connected to an 
&gt; XServe RAID via fibre channel, and it transfers to/from this at 
&gt; absolute insane speeds.
&gt; 
&gt; I just converted one filesystem to XFS, and as I suspected, it made 
&gt; absolutely no difference to transfer speeds.
&gt; 
&gt; Argh.  Anybody want to suggest anything?  :-(

We came across an interesting bug in the FreeBSD NFS server code in 4.6.2 
which was still in the code all the way to 5.x. This bug only affected 
server code, so I don't know if it is what you are seeing.

The server code only allocated socket buffer space (this was TCP, BTW), of 
32kB plus a bit for the RPC overhead. The client was doing 64kB reads. 
The first 32kB went out, but the second 32kB was not sent until the Linux 
client acked the very last segment of the first 32kB. This caused long 
pauses in the middle (something like 32ms) and reduced throughput to 
something like 6MB/s. Today we can get 70+MB/s. The problem was that the 
in-kernel NFS server was using kernel routines that would not put any data 
in the socket buffer until all the space needed was there. Since the last 
segment of the last 32kB was still in the socket buffer, there was not 
room for another 32kB + header space.

You can check for these problems by grabbing a capture and looking at it 
with the Analyse--&gt;Tcp Stream Analysis--&gt;tcptrace type and look for a 
marked staircase effect in the graph.
