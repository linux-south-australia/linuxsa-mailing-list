&gt; &gt; Yes, the theoretical limit for Cat5 cabling is 100 metres, although due to
&gt; &gt; surrounding conditions, cable quality, and a range of other issues, these
&gt; &gt; cables often don't perform up to this standard, and for example, will maybe
&gt; &gt; work up to 80 metres on one day, 60 the next and maybe 90 the day after.
&gt; 
&gt; Err - no.  Cat5 works at 100m (actually 90m plus 10m for patchleads).  It
&gt; may work beyond this.  If you have a cabling run that doesn't work at 100m
&gt; then it was installed badly or has been damaged or isn't actually Cat5.

yup 90m no more for building runs...

i would suggest getting yourself a roll of CAT5 STP, shielded twiseted pair,
as opposed to CAT5 UTP, being unshielded twisted pair. its a tad more
expensive, but will run 100MB without any problems to 100M  =)

I have done a similar thing with two 100M lengths from switches on each
end to a switch in the middle, a hub in the middle did not work so well.

5 port 10/100Mbit switches are less than AUD$60 + ~AUD$150 for 300M roll
of STP.

easy,
