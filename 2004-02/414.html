*nod*

&gt; 
&gt; I think there are degrees of the 'RTFM argument'. An RTFM for some 
&gt; obscure badly documented technical magic is uncalled for. Although a 
&gt; quick google before asking is usually appreciated.

*more nodding*

&gt; 
&gt; But there are extremes cases where the RTFM argument is the only one.

"Damn right!"

&gt; 
&gt; Have you ever read those warnings on hand dryers that advise against 
&gt; drying your face incase you fuse your eyes? Or the ones on hair dryers 
&gt; about using them in the bath. The labels are there because hospitals 
&gt; (and morgues) get a steady stream of people doing these amazingly fucked 
&gt; up things every day.

*chuckle*

&gt; 
&gt; Some of these same people use computers. When these people aren't 
&gt; electrocuting themselves or fusing their eyeballs they spend most of 
&gt; their time opening virus attachments, typing their credit card numbers 
&gt; in response to emails from "their bank", installing "Microsoft Updates", 
&gt;   forwarding chain mails and ordering viagra of the internet.

*guffaw*

&gt; 
&gt; It is apparently illegal to kill these people. Although we read the 
&gt; Darwin Awards with glee when they choose to remove themselves from the 
&gt; gene pool of their own free will. So those of us who do IT support 
&gt; choose to bitch endlessly about them instead and with some justification.

*loud applause*

There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.
