&gt; And just to follow up myself again, that 10MB/sec was a once off, I

&gt; full-duplex, though.
&gt;
&gt; What kind of speeds should I expect?
&gt;
&gt; I know that the G5 isn't a bottleneck as it's also connected to an
&gt; XServe RAID via fibre channel, and it transfers to/from this at
&gt; absolute insane speeds.
&gt;
&gt; I just converted one filesystem to XFS, and as I suspected, it made
&gt; absolutely no difference to transfer speeds.
&gt;
&gt; Argh.  Anybody want to suggest anything?  :-(

Have you been through the Linux NFS-HOWTO, esp. 5. Optimizing NFS
Performance?

e.g. Try increasing the number of instances of nfsd. (nfsd -n)

Have you checked through the configuration of your network adapters and
interfaces (eg. MTU?).

Are you using NFS over TCP rather than UDP? (nfsd -t)

Maybe look at top and other monitors while a copy is running, is
anything showing high usage, maybe a process or maybe the interrupt
usage is high (does top in Linux show interrupt %cpu usage, or is that a
FBSD thing?).

Can you try an FTP copy? These (from what I've been reading) typically
perform much faster than NFS so if you can get fast transfers with FTP
then I guess that narrows it down to something specific to your NFS, or
at least largely exonerates your adapters/network.


Good luck!

Wayne
