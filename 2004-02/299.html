&gt;&gt;RAID Arrangement:
&gt;&gt;Reported in WinXP system Devices under SCSI and RAID 
&gt;&gt;controllers as WinXP Promise Fasttrak100 TX2/TX4(tm) 
&gt;&gt;Controller.  In Disk Drives it says: Promise 2+0 Stripe/RAID0 
&gt;&gt;SCSI disk device.

&gt; Forgive me for asking, and I know this won't help you with your problem,
&gt; but is there a reason you chose Raid0 for this setup? I've always
&gt; considered Raid0 as a neat idea that delivers some speed improvement at
&gt; (for me) the too high expense of reducing your redundancy by half. I
&gt; like the sound of Raid10 (or 1+0) which is supposed to deliver
&gt; redundancy and speed, but at the cost of 50% of your drive capacity.

No harm in asking.  In truth it was recommended to me by the guy who 
built this machine.  I looked it up and like you said it has better 
speed and puts your data at the risk of both hard drives with my setup. 
  There are many other possible raid setups some offering both speed and 
reliability.  basically the more disks you have the better and more 
options you have.  Ultimately speed is nice for all the usual reasons 
and data reliability means far less to me because I don't run a server 
or anything mission critical on it and backup quite regularly.  So for 
my case I decided to take it.
&gt; 
&gt; I've never tried to install linux against a Promise IDE Raid Controller,
&gt; but I have had occasion to boot an existing system (FastTrack Raid1)
&gt; with Knoppix, and it did detect the controller ok, but presented me with
&gt; 2 identical volumes instead of 1.

I have used Knopix on this system. I didn't appear to find the hard 
drive at all.  Not a problem for Knoppix, it doesn't need one after all.

You've said the core of the problem.  getting Linux to see the physical 
drives isn't too hard but getting to see them as raid is not so simple. 
  I could get (on the second try using the website isntructions in the 
link of my previous email) to the partition part of the installation and 
it shows dh1 and dh3.  Looking at 'custom', dh1 shows as fully used by 
windows at 199% capacity (because actually windows is fully using the 
other disk too) and dh3 shows as being empty.
&gt;
