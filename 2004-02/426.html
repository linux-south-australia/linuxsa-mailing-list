&gt; Bull!

No really. Microsoft told all these people that they could have bigger
penises. These people believed them. We consider this stupid but the
media and a heap of 'experts' validated Microsoft and said that if
people didn't get a bigger penis, it wasn't Microsofts fault.

People have different specialities when it comes to intelligence. Some
people are deficient in the areas we grasp easily. It is smarter to
recognise this than ignore it. Apple wanted to make the Macintosh as
easy to use as a bicycle and mostly succeeded. These people should have
been using Macs. The way Gnome is going (the right way IMO) it is going
to be just as good. We need a simple unambiguous interface and we need
to make decisions on behalf of these people that they are incapable of
making.

We have the CLI and we can run ratpoison, afterstep, blackbox, fvwm, E
etc if we want to escape. And we can su. But these people need a safe
friendly environment. The best we can hope for is that occasionally some 
of these users will wake up from the illusion we create for them and 
start to learn.

There are probably a percentage of these people we could get to while
they are still at school and get some geek values into them.

To do that we need a high school computing curriculum that values
research, programming and open source methodology. A computing
curriculum aimed at creating producers. At the moment the curriculum is
producing consumers.  They are reinforcing the lie that Micosoft has all
the answers, and they have opted to teach the use of applications
instead of fundamental concepts. Bright kids leave high school having
only ever used Microsoft products. And thinking that they know
everything there is to know about computers because they can create a
form in access and added a row of numbers in excel. We should show them 
the power of the cli, scripting languages and open source development 
while their minds are open.
