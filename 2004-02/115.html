&gt;A little oblique to this - but here goes.
&gt;I have run Red Hat & Mandrake, played with Knoppix, & Lindows for over a year
&gt;now.
&gt;
&gt;My kids (8 & 10) insist on a version of Linux at home & use certain
&gt;applications much more proficiently than I.
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, I as a life scientist have found, the Linux forum as fascinating
&gt;as it is - too time consuming to get to the applications end.  I'm not
&gt;comfortable & confident enough to set it up, rely on it & know I can trouble
&gt;shoot quickly & effectively.  Yet I need to run biological *nix applications, &
&gt;connect to various clusters.
&gt;
&gt;The result: at 40 yrs of age I bought my first Mac (1.25MHz G4 PowerBook).  I
&gt;am now able to stop concerning myself with which distro & get on with the job.
&gt;In three weeks I feel comfortable configuring preferences, & now rely on the
&gt;machine for most of my work.
&gt;
&gt;A simple guide to which distro with blunt pros & cons so a potential user
&gt;didn't have to feel they were taking a punt as to which time consuming
&gt;investment to follow would help.
&gt;
&gt;I'll continue to use Linux at home (although now competing with OS 10.3).  As a
&gt;researcher I understand the departure a discipline needs to take from the
&gt;pedestrian to develop & evolve.  I just wish I didn't feel so pedestrian in an
&gt;area I have  such an interest in.

Hi Martin,

If you don't mind me asking, why would someone in your situation want
to play with different distributions at all?

Like you, I need to run *nix applications for work, and prefer to do
the same at home. I happen to use Redhat, which lets me do that,
but I imagine any other Linux distribution would do the same. I can't
imagine voluntarily going through the pain of installing a different
distribution and I'm rather puzzled why you would want to.
