Steve,

&gt; It feels kinda frustrating when SA has a great OSS presence and the 
&gt; politicians are about as supportive of OSS in IT as the TALIBAN were about
&gt; women's rights.

Well, without starting a flame war, according to the Taliban a woman's right
was to be owned by men. And to walk even further off the subject, the Qu'ran
is actually quite supportive of women if you were to take it in its proper
historical context.

It's the lack of evolution, change and intake of new ideas that perverts
many religions as the same lack of evolution, change and intake of new ideas
does the same to other things.

&gt; ACT and now NSW, no doubt we will steadfastly hold up the rear as usual.

This, though, has the advantage of watching and learning from their
mistakes. Remember, a half empty glass is half full too.
