Hi all,

Rather a long one - my apologies to those with little patience in =
advance:

After many months (about 6? now) of lurking, combined with afew months =
of playing with the RH (v9) distro - I am now ready to take the plunge =
and convert my entire Home Network (4 box's in total) to Linux as (a) =
I'm sick of constantly plugging holes in Mr Gates's wonderful software - =
and (b) I finally feel confident of being able to competnently install =
software/games not already installed in whatever distro I get - as well =
as being able to network the pooters, share the DSL, printer and etc.  =
(Don't worry - I'm sure the frantic cries for help won't be long in =
coming...  *Grins*)

The ONLY problem I'm facing that I'm NOT sure how to handle/get around =
is the fact that my boys PC (Used by my 4 and 3 year old boys) which is =
currently running Win XP-Pro - runs educational software (about 10discs =
in total) that is designed to run on Windows...

Accordingly, here's my question: Do any of the Linux distros have the =
ability to run Windows (XP) PC games on them - and if not, is there a =
relativly cheap program (Free is better of course) that will allow this =
software to be 'translated on the fly' when the boys put the discs into =
the machine?  Now... if running PC games on a LInux distro isn't a =
reasonable ask: Does anyone know if there are appropriate educational =
games (that make math, english education fun for a 4 and 3 year old - =
that's challenging but adictivly fun at the same time) that have already =
been ported over to Linux???  For the record (as far as distros go) I =
don't have any brand loyalty to speak of so don't worry about offence =
being taken if it's Lindows that you think would be best - similarly no =
other brand is out either!!!  (With the ONE exception being that what is =
suggested MUST be GUI based - as I'm not (yet) able to handle CLI =
interfaces.

As far as what I want to do with the boxes, I want the boys box to be =
able to primarily play educational games, DVD's, listen to music, surf =
the Net, E-Mail as well as be able to use 'Office' type software... as =
well as accessing/using a picture drawing programme similar to the =
'Paint' programme both boys are currently addicted to...  If it matters, =
the boys PC is currently a Genuine Intel Pentium 3 (1GHz) Processor, =
running with 256MB of SD-RAM as well as a 32MB Video Card, 3COM NIC, =
Onboard (MB) Sound and a 40GB HDD running an old 15" monitor (Compaq) I =
upgraded from awhile back.

As to the other 3 boxes I've got, there's no Windows software I cannot =
live without, so it matters not what distros I put on these I'm thinking =
- as long as I can emulate what I'm doing with my existing network which =
is:  Using one of the boxes as a Server primarily (All my movies, TV Eps =
and Music are stored on it) with write permission restricted to that =
box, and those directorys (only) shared to the other 3 boxes on the LAN =
thereby enabeling any of the other boxes to stream music, tv eps or =
whatever through the LAN either to the TV in the lounge, or wherever =
else.  Apart from these 2 exceptions (Boys PC and the other PC that =
doubles as a Server/workstation) it's a standard setup with no issues I =
can think of that I should specifically mention.

Any ideas on which Distro(s) would be most suited so I can get started =
giving Mr Gate's - and the abundant proliferation of Viri (etc) his =
wonderful distro seems to attrack - the flick from our home/lives?


Thanks in advance for the advice!

David WOLVERTON
