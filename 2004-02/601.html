David,

I haven't read this whole thread yet, but I wanted to add,

If they are considering Windows specifically, you will need to 
demonstrate how Windows is not the best solution. Probably the essence 
of my argument would be identifying the _percieved_ advantages of 
Windows, and demonstrating their problems;

1. Most corporations have a massive investment in Windows based software 
and infrastructure. Optus does not, and so this should not be taken into 
account in this instance. (Note: somehow, it almost certainly is, 
however illogical.)

2. Windows has a huge software base to draw upon. For most applications 
and application classes that Optus uses or may wish to use in the 
future, The most likely platform to find it on is Windows. However, this 
gap is narrowing between Windows and Unix (note, not Linux), and indeed 
also Mac and any other platform. The likelihood that Optus will require 
windows to perform a business function today is small to zero, 
especially given the importance of a customer the size of Optus to 
software producers.

3. You will have to address Microsoft Office, convincingly. Don't forget 
Outlook and Exchange. Once again, Optus has a major advantage where they 
are not yet committed to exchange and outlook.

4. Address Active Directory, which will be pushed to them. Active 
Directory will be sold to them as the bes network infrastructure 
available. It _may_ be the best available for Windows, although I would 
probably buy Novell instead, but it has two disadvantages - First, once 
you commit to Active Directory, it's almost impossible to rip up; and 
Second, Active Directory on the server pretty much necessitates Windows 
on the Client, and makes other servers harder, whereas Unix, or even 
Novell, are agnostic who they serve to. Windows infrastructure can exist 
on a non-Windows server; the reverse is much harder.

Other points, or soundbytes :-

There is nothing that Windows does best. (This is a bold statement, 
which is meant to incite debate. However there _is_ _almost_ nothing 
that Windows does best that can't be shown to be irrelevant or avoidable 
in the workplace - except games)

Among others, Sun's Java Desktop is from all reports tailored almost 
precisely for organisations like Optus, and will allow them better 
flexibility in the further, including the flexibility to switch away.

The ability to switch away is important, because it means that the 
current platform has to be competitive when it is chosen, and also has 
to remain competitive once it is in place. Windows philosophy voids this 
idea, and so should be mistrusted.

Security - maybe set a timeline for then to take Windows security 
seriously, something like "The year that Windows security causes less 
worldwide economic disruption than Unix security". or even, "...than 
war". If the Windows pushers talk about how much more Windows there is 
out there to exploit, there are two counters that I can quickly think of 
- First, "alright, worldwide economic disruption in proportion to 
worldwide deployment", and second add in the cost of security 
maintenance, where Unix of course wins hands down.

Linux, despite it's waxing popularity, can be easily regarded as "just 
another unix" for many, many purposes. Unices can be swapped in and out 
for each othyer to a very great extent, and will work homogeneously 
together - they live in a competitive market. Windows can not, and does not.

All of this is just a brain dump of ideas. I hope you find it useful.

James
