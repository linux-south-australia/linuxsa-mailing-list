&gt; Also; the main problem I have with 'firewall' devices such as the 
&gt; Billion is that they're often extremely basic; the firewall 
&gt; functionality is as simple as the fact it's doing NAT, and you can't 
&gt; contact a host with a private IP by normal means.  Due to the fact the 
&gt; software remains basically static (ROM versus hard drive), after the 
&gt; vendor stops caring about the product and stops releasing firmware 
&gt; updates, it's very possible holes in the device's TCP stack / NAT / web 
&gt; interface / etc could be discovered which may prove very interesting to 
&gt; patch; and even arguably while they do support it, especially in the 
&gt; case of the vendor writing their own software.  I always feel a hell of 
&gt; a lot safer with a nicely configured Linux/BSD firewall in place, 
&gt; personally.

Horse for course Ryan.

Each approach has it's benefits.  

Imbedded devices -&gt; cheap, throw away.  Breaks, or doesn't get upgraded, get 
a new one.  Obviously, not flexible, limited features.  Very quick to 
deploy.  No moving parts.

OS Based Firewalls -&gt; more expensive, more complex to install and maintain 
(heck, it's a whole OS that needs to be tended to).  But flexible and 
feature rich.   Has moving parts.

OS based firewalls can be just as bad if people don't look after them or 
allow "too many holes".

With (for instance) the Billion range, we're talking about a device that's 
under $200.  If it gets to a point where it's not supported, it's easy to 
get a newer supported one.   It's very easily to deploy (heck, I "deployed" 
one at my Dad's in 15mins).   It's silent (important as my Dad's home office 
is next to his bedroom) and is basically secure (the firewall is a bit more 
than NAT).  But it's secure enough.

The "no moving parts" and "no messy os" to deal with can be real benefits.
Especially when rebuilding a firewall after a fault.  (eg. A Cisco PIX 
firewall is easy to recover, you need a hardware description, OS level, 
feature license and a config file that's a text file - whereas to ensure an 
OS based firewall is the same is much more complex and requires specific 
builds of all the software components.  It's thus MUCH harder to audit).
