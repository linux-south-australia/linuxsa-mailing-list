&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; Thought I'd throw some thought-provoking questions onto the intellectual fire that is this mailing list.
&gt; 
&gt; Following along from television series' such as Big Brother and Survivor, television stations seem to have jumped at the idea and introduced numerous new series' based on the reality television concept. Some people may say that it is going too far. Some, such as my high-school headmaster, go as far to say that the concept is evil and is contributing to the demise of human society. Others will just follow the crowd like the sheep that they are, and like and accept what the media dictates them to like and accept.
&gt; 
&gt; Was Australian Idol and the other Idol series' different to the Big Brother style of reality television? Does the fact that they have to be good at what they do to win the competition rather than to simply be accepted by the other "characters" on the television show make any difference?
&gt; 
&gt; Is it going too far? Do we really care what these people think and do? Do we want to watch humans fall to such low standards as they turn against each other to succeed at whatever it is they are supposed to be succeeding at?
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anything else that anyone wants to bring up? What are your own thoughts on reality television?
&gt; 
&gt; I look forward to reading your responses, and to partaking in the discussion that follows.
&gt; 
&gt; - Adam

welcome back to the roman circus my friend. its human nature to be
spectators in the live sof others- watch any small village in action for
that. jerry springer is a sad example of the unreality of reality tv,
reality warped as entertainment. 

what is scary, imho, is more the acceptability of cruelty in these shows
- the crueller the comments, the better the ratings. the mmore demenaing
  an ordeal, the better audiences like it.

  bring on the lions?
