Reality TV ?

What the hell's that ?  

I've only got *one* station on my set and haven't felt any need to get the 
other lot going.  Based on what's been said in this discussion, seems I'm not 
missing much so I'll delay fixing the other channels for another decade.  
Somebody, please give 's 'n 'oi'  if anything interesting happens on those 
'other' stations.

Cheers,

Andrew

&gt;  &gt; Is it going too far? Do we really care what these people think and do?

&gt;
&gt; Don't think of them as "Reality TV" -- because they plainly aren't real.
&gt;
&gt; Do you seriously think that Big Brother's producer doesn't control your
&gt; perception of the contestants by cleverly choosing the 3 minutes (out of
&gt; the last 24 hours) worth of footage you're going to see each person
&gt; featuring in during the nightly broadcast?
&gt;
&gt; Do you really think it was a big shock worthy of a New Idea when one of
&gt; the original Pop Stars contestants was kicked out for stealing?  Was it
&gt; *still* worthy when you think about the fact that it was all filmed
&gt; six months before it aired, so everyone concerned knew it had happened
&gt; before the series even reached TV, but they all carried out the first two
&gt; months of the series pretending that the kicked-out contestant still had
&gt; a chance?
&gt;
&gt; So it isn't Reality TV.  So what is it?
&gt;
&gt; Game shows.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, game shows.  Only you can't call them game shows, because everyone's
&gt; too hip to watch them.  So you call them reality TV instead.  But they're
&gt; still game shows.
&gt;
&gt; There isn't a lot of difference between the emotional highs and lows
&gt; that are felt in those shows versus the emotional highs and lows felt
&gt; by a gibbering, giggling hearts-a-flutter "New Price Is Right" audience
&gt; member who has just been told to "come on down."  It's all the same.
&gt;
&gt; With one small detail of difference:  Have you noticed how DULL those
&gt; shows are?  My girlfriend watched the last series of The Bachelor -- DULL!
&gt; Sooooo maaaaaany reeeeeeaally looooong, sloooooow shots of people walking
&gt; about from place to place, or looking at each other across a room crowded
&gt; with other people doing exactly the same thing.  I sat with her one night
&gt; and watched an episode;  I swear I could feel my brain atrophying between
&gt; the commercials.  Oh my god!
