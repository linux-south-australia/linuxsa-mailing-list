<H1>Year of the Desktop</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
This year, for the first time, after a decade of using Linux, it has 
become my desktop OS of choice.

Linux was my desktop for the last couple of years at work. But I had 
vmware on it, and I used 2000 and then XP for a lot of "Application" 
stuff. I have over the years used Linux as my main OS at home, when I 
bothered having a computer at home.

But this year is different. I noticed last week my usage patterns have 
changed. I haven't booted into XP for what seems like weeks. And I am 
not using my desktop just to manage a bunch of xterms anymore.

I found myself plugging in a digital camera. Clicking on the camera 
picture on my desktop. And dragging pictures to folders on my desktop. 
No mount or cp in sight. I have been editing them in the gimp. I have 
been using xine to watch wmv and quicktime. And I got Firefox yesterday 
- I loved Firebird but this is brilliant. I still usually have a few 
xterms open, but more for managing remote machines, kernel builds etc. 
But I have spent whole days acting like a User. I didn't even do that 
when I used Windows (which was mainly an environment to run Putty).

This whole thing has kind of snuck up on me. I would like to say thanks 
to everyone involved, especially the Gnome and Mozilla people.
