Corey [bubs],

&gt; So you've missapproriated a police name? That's good. I hope that this
&gt; doesn't entail the same penalties as misapproriating a police uniform!

What the....? I WORK for SAPol in the State Intelligence Branch as an
Intelligence Analyst. Not everyone in SAPol is a cop and in fact, my
position is SPECIFICALLY for non-cops with degrees which are useful to the
organisation, mine being in science with chemistry majors.

&gt; If you don't care less - let me put it the most eloquent way I can - say
&gt; nothing at all about it. You obviously care a little more than less...

Maybe so. I wasn't formally informing you specifically that I hated WH and
LoTR but was making an off-the-cuff remark. I was reliably informed that
this list is part tech forum part social club. In a social situation do you
make it abundantly clear that everything you say is directly related to the
topic at hand and that you won't say anything off-topic? Having witnessed it
first hand, I know you don't.

&gt; ROFL

&gt; If you think that you have the proof then why don't you actually call me a
&gt; dumbarse [sic] (I think you mean dumb arse - i.e. an arse that does not
&gt; speak) out in the open?

The less said about your arse, the better. Besides, I meant it in the
colloquial not the formal. Don't play pedantics with a master of the art.

Plus it's pretty clear I wasn't calling you a dumbarse. If I wanted to, I'd
have no hesitation. If you ARSEume nothing else, ASSume that.

&gt; THEY HATES US, YES THEY HATES US; THOSE FILTHY HOBITTSES!\

&gt; *pmsl*

Errr, I'm not up to speed on 'net jargon. Lil' help?
