Considering the hell people get given for not writing documentation you 
might expect people would want to use it ;-)

I think there are degrees of the 'RTFM argument'. An RTFM for some 
obscure badly documented technical magic is uncalled for. Although a 
quick google before asking is usually appreciated.

But there are extremes cases where the RTFM argument is the only one.

Have you ever read those warnings on hand dryers that advise against 
drying your face incase you fuse your eyes? Or the ones on hair dryers 
about using them in the bath. The labels are there because hospitals 
(and morgues) get a steady stream of people doing these amazingly fucked 
up things every day.

Some of these same people use computers. When these people aren't 
electrocuting themselves or fusing their eyeballs they spend most of 
their time opening virus attachments, typing their credit card numbers 
in response to emails from "their bank", installing "Microsoft Updates", 
  forwarding chain mails and ordering viagra of the internet.

It is apparently illegal to kill these people. Although we read the 
Darwin Awards with glee when they choose to remove themselves from the 
gene pool of their own free will. So those of us who do IT support 
choose to bitch endlessly about them instead and with some justification.

&gt; 
&gt; I feel it's one of the reasons many ppl evade linux.  Ultimately it's 
&gt; about what you want to do with your time and effort.  Linux users tend 
&gt; to be quite competant with computing because they spend the vast amount 
&gt; of time learning all those details.  Mechanics, for example, are good at 
&gt; their work because of their time and effort.  I wonder if, for example, 
&gt;  'RTFM' Zealots read their car manuals thus evading their mates wasting 
&gt; time fixing their stupid mistakes.
