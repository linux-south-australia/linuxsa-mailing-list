Heya,

Ive had a good play with knoppix, including building my own version (for
work).
I haven't had any issues with mounting a USB key drive, I actually wrote
a script to automagicly detect and mount it :)
The only thing to be carefully of is if the system you are using already
has SCSI drives in it! I accidentally formated the /boot partition! But
funnily enough the thing still managed to boot off it! Thats lilo for
you :)

Cheers,

Ben.

&gt; &gt; Would love to use a knoppix style CD that I can pop into a pC at one of our
&gt; &gt; sites and log stuff to my USB key.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I tried downloading:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Echelon
&gt; &gt; Knoppix STD
&gt; &gt; and L.A.S
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; but unfortunately they all either didnt boot or complained they couldnt find
&gt; &gt; the knoppix file system..  They were looking towards /dev/scd0... Is that an
&gt; &gt; attempt at looking at a SCSI drive??  I dont have any SCSI cards in my
&gt; &gt; system or is it just an ATAPI emulation of SCSI???
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any ideas on applicable packages or solutions to the knoppix filesystem
&gt; &gt; issue very much welcome..
&gt; 
&gt; IIRR, most usbkeys/memory/disk/storage/pendrives are accessed as scsi
&gt; devices, such as /dev/sda1 and are often formated as type vfat.
&gt; 
&gt; you will have to have a kernel with atapi scsi emulation, usb and
&gt; usbstorage compiled as modules ... well thats how mine now works =)
&gt; 
&gt; i broke my knoppix CD so i'll have to make another and give it a go =)
&gt; 
&gt; its possible you could use a standard knoppix disk and have your
&gt; network monitoring code and data on the usbkey...
&gt; 
&gt; that would be easier than modifying a knoppix install, burning, testing,
&gt; repeat...
&gt; 
&gt; cheers,
