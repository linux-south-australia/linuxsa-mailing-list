I'm in favour, in these cases, of contacting management and explaining
what occurred. They are responsible for how their staff present
themselves to customers, and would rather know shockers like this, so
person can be trained appropriately.

Oh dear, thats just - umm......

r:)

ps wouldnt be likely to opt for an LG now - 4 damn hours???
(i like my ^H^H^H^HDell....but thanks, good info:)  )

On Fri, Feb 06, 2004 at 11:57:16PM +1030, Ian Loxton imparted:
&gt; My daughter's brand new (~4 hrs usage in 1 week) LG laptop had its hard 
&gt; drive fail. Yep, it lasted around 4 hours!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, back to the seller's main store (Hint: Yellow figures 
&gt; prominently in their ads). LG apparently moved warehouse so for a few 
&gt; days nothing was done. Then we get the usual wait while the drive turns 
&gt; up from the supplier.
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday daughter rings the Service Depot to see how things are 
&gt; progressing. Service Chick responds, "Well while you are waiting you 
&gt; can take your computer home and use it. It doesn't need the hard drive 
&gt; to run does it?"
&gt; 
&gt; The Service folks in this Co are usually pretty good and perhaps this 
&gt; phone person is new to the task but gee whiz, somebody needs to give 
&gt; her some basic product knowledge.
&gt; 
&gt;  Cheers,
&gt;  Ian
