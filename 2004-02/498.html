Optus are replacing very old Macs with Windows. While new Macs would be 
nice, there's no denying that PCs are much cheaper in terms of 
bums-on-seats for workstation use, as the typical office machine 
doesn't need all the extras that Macs provide by default. The upside is 
that the new Windows machines can be converted to Linux at some future 
stage fairly easily, as the hardware investment for both options is the 
same.

The argument I would be pushing is to make sure that the purchased 
hardware is fully compatible with Linux to ensure that management have 
an escape route they can employ if the shit hits the fan. We know it 
probably will, but it's our word against theirs, so any debate will 
have to be along the lines of keeping options open rather than "that 
sucks, this rules".

Remember that there will be a number of managers who have put their 
reputations on the line, so they're going to block anything that makes 
them look bad... so you have to present alternatives in a way that 
saves face for everyone.
