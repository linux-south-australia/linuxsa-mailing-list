My main efforts when it comes to computers are to my friends and my family.
In fact, I even have friends who *only* call me when they want something
computer-related, which has recently begun to annoy me alot. To these people
I have recently made it quite clear - call and be friends, not only when you
want something! Wankers!

Sorry, but that is a sensitive issue to me at the moment. Those who
appreciate my time and effort get my assistance whenever they require it,
and in my experience, most are willing to do what they are instructed, and
are reasonably computer literate. I think my hardest case would be my
grandparents, who do their best, but often cannot remember how to do
something, which button or key to click or strike, etc. In this case, I
guess it is just great that they are willing to try.

Fortunately, neither myself nor many of the people I 'service' seem to get
viruses or other related issues. I seem to survive pretty well on that
front, and consequently, I do not have many educational or recovery
strategies in place. Except to say always leave an email alone if you are
not expecting it, don't use certain websites, or *types* of websites, as the
case may be, do not download anything unless you are sure of what it is, and
are sure you need it. If in any doubt, give me a quick call. On the recovery
front, I keep backup CDs of each computer's software, drivers, etc. as well
as a Norton Ghost boot disk and hard disk image taped to the inside of the
computer case. Usually, backing up any files to a spare hard disk and
sorting them out later, and refreshing the system from an image is the best
approach in most cases.

Hope this is informative, and of some use!

- Adam

&gt; &gt; Education is always the key but looking at the school system and the
&gt; &gt; education outside school by courses, activities, family and tertiary
&gt; &gt; studies doesn't give me a whole lotta hope.
&gt;
&gt; I'm interested to hear what others are doing about this.
&gt;
&gt; In the courses I teach I spend a lot of time on virus protection, spam &
&gt; scams/urban legends, hackers.  I keep a stockpile of these type of emails
and
&gt; good/correct newspaper articles which I display in my training room and
give
&gt; to students.  I also put a tips section in our totally non-tech
newsletter.
&gt; When I clean up a friend's Windows computer I usually leave them with info
on
&gt; viruses too.
&gt;
&gt; Some of you may be able to do some of these things too.  I'll bet you
belong
&gt; to a group which has a newsletter.  You could offer to write a short
computer
&gt; tips section on protecting your computer from viruses.
