The answer is a generalisation, because its highly subject to local factors
in your specific exchange area (e.g. Potential high incidence of RIM units,
long lines in old areas, etc etc). So there are local pockets of rejection
rate in some areas far above the general average.

That said, the overall average success rate on the Internode customer base,
the last time I did the sums on it, was around 80% success, amongst the folk
who were actually in an enabled exchange area (i.e. Of course the fail rate
is much higher if you factor in the applicants whose exchanges aren't yet
ADSL enabled).

A specific class of failure reason ("transmission loss too high') will be
substantially improved by a change Telstra have (finally) promised to make
in March to their acceptance criteria for ADSL applications. That should
create a situation where many (most?) of the folk rejected for this specific
reason will have a good chance of getting ADSL if they reapply after this
change has been made by Telstra (it'll be widely annnounced when it happens,
little chance of not noticing).

The highest percentage of failures we see when potential customers apply to
Internode is the above category. The second highest percentage of failures
is 'Incompatible Infrastructure - RIM'.

The RIM class is slowly being chopped away by Telstra (thus far the pace is
glacial, but we have hopes that it'll accelerate), as they (after years of
thinking about it) are now finally starting to dabble in installing mini
DSLAM units into RIM cabinets.

Cheers,
Simon

&gt; That's interesting, but not what I want. Just because your exchange is
&gt; ADSL enabled, it does not follow that you can get ADSL. (As I
&gt; discovered). 
&gt; 
&gt; What I want is the % of homes that can actually get ADSL (perhaps from
&gt; success rate of applications made ?!)
