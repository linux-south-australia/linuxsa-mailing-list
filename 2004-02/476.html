&gt; As to the OS X bit, I agree it doesn't make sense either - and though 
&gt; I'm
&gt; not in a position to KNOW, my SUSPICION is that it's more of a case of 
&gt; Optus
&gt; making so much money (profit wise) that they need to quickly get rid of
&gt; large chunks of it - and big investments in infrastructure (amongst 
&gt; other
&gt; necessities such as exective cars, trinkets and baubles) will certainly
&gt; achieve that for them...

In which case, they *want* to spend money.  Your argument needs to be 
case specific, and right now it focuses on cost - maybe you need to 
refocus.

&gt; Last - but certainly not least - I totally agree about the short and 
&gt; sweet
&gt; rule -- and just wanted to reitterate that what I sent to the group is 
&gt; only
&gt; a draft with thoughts splashed out on it.  (The actual presentation 
&gt; will be
&gt; no more than 2x A4 sheets with lots of space to make it easy on eyes.) 
&gt;  :-)

I'm no expert at this kind of thing, but perhaps your two sheets could 
be structured such that the first sheet is especially brief, and 
focuses on a few key points, and the second sheet elaborates in detail 
on those points.
