Hi all,

&gt; I am fast coming to the point of where I believe that my efforts are 
&gt; not going to be achieving any form of success
&gt;
so, because of technical problems, now I have been given a Compaq 
Armada 4130T notebook. A nice unit with P133, 16 M (can take up to 80 
M). Touchpad, colour TFT screen, inbuilt soundcard and speakers. Cool.

Now I'm trying to get something on the HDD because it didn't come with 
one, and the docs say it can go to a 4 G. I have a fast-fading IBM 6 G 
that I am trying to use. It had Lycoris on it, that dates back to when 
I had the drive in Mum's laptop in Perth for LCA 2003.

I want this to be a Linux box. I believe the specs now give me a much 
better chance of getting it penguin-ised. But, VL linux 3.2 wont boot. 
Same with Small Linux, Lycoris. RH 7, Tom's root boot even.

Last night it was still booting until I gave up at 5 am. Since I have 
been trying from this morning I have had a negative response. I get the 
LEDs on the top glowing as normal. That's it. No beeps. No RAM count. 
No movement from the drives. Dead as ....

I have RTFM, both the user and dealer manuals. Not a clue about this. 
The powerpack is working fine, the meter checks out at 18+ v. Just 
nothing else happening. 

Any ideas? Oh. The power switch used to turn it off and on, now no 
effect. Only way to stop it is to pull the plug. Did I say the handle 
battery was dead as a dodo? Not a peep, something has died because it 
isn't even being detected. That's how it was when I got it. Needs 
replacement.

Anybody got a similar model sitting around in an unserviceable state 
that I might be able to use for parts?

 Cheers,
 Ian
