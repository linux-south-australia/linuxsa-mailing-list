Well I've just tried to install Linux Mandrake 9.2 on my system so that 
I might have a dual-boot arrangement.  As I expected it didn't work.  I 
get a message that the partition table is too corrupted and it wants to 
format the hard drive.

I knew that result was likely from all the reading I've been doing but I 
just had to try it :)

I also tried the methods in the website below to get around it as best I 
was able.

<A HREF="http://mdkpromise.rjvrijhof.com/">http://mdkpromise.rjvrijhof.com/</A>

That didn't work either, presenting me with two separate hard drives. 
The first one 199% filled with windows, the second 'empty'

My system includes a raid arrangement like this:
Physical Hard Drives:
Maxtor 60GB 7200RPM ATA-133 x 2

RAID Arrangement:
Reported in WinXP system Devices under SCSI and RAID controllers as 
WinXP Promise Fasttrak100 TX2/TX4(tm) Controller.  In Disk Drives it 
says: Promise 2+0 Stripe/RAID0 SCSI disk device.

I looked at this issue by Googling, forums and the mandrake and promise 
websites before I installed quite a bit.  I haven't seen anything 
terribly helpful to a newbie on it (apart from, perhaps, the link above) 
and it looks like the majority of ppl who come across the problem simply 
give up.  It's discussed plenty of course because these simple raid 
arrangements are modestly popular.

I'd love some help getting this thing going with it somehow but if it 
truly is in the too hard basket feel free to tell me and I'll stop 
wasting my time on it.

Apparently linux can do raid and quite well from what i gather in a 
software mode but it simply doesn't play well with raid controllers. 
Raid controllers are needed for windowsXP so to dual boot you need Linux 
to use that mode, not software.
