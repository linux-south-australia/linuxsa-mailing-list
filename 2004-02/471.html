Hello again all,

The following is a draft of a proposal I'm putting together to attempt =
to sway Optus (my present employer) from abandoning its current tech =
infrastructure of Macintosh G3 and G4's - in favour of Microsoft Windows =
XP-Pro...  My hope is that if an argument can be shown that appeals to =
Optus in a way the major decision makers can't argue with, that Optus as =
a body Corporate, as well as it's Employees and it's Customers (not to =
mention the Linux Community) can all walk away clear winners by pushing =
Optus into the Linux camp.

Since I know so little and have such little experience in Linux - I =
would like to throw this rough draft out to this User Group and beg for =
EVERYONE'S help in presenting the best argument that can be made so that =
I can take these facts/arguments and (hopefully) prevent Optus from a =
mistake that would have YEARS of consequences. (Optus has stuck with its =
current Mac platform since its inception - and while it's better - imho =
- than Windows, I can't beleive it'd hold a candle to Linux)

No help to bg or small, oh and this IS rather urgent as I have to have =
the draft completed by next week - Friday 20th - so it can be presented =
to one of the big wig decision makers who's scheduled to come down =
towards the end of this month (For obvious security reasons it would be =
wrong to say either who or when)

Thanks in advance for any/all help!!!
David WOLVERTON

-----------------------------
(Potential argument illustrations) Virus's/Backdoors/Trojan's on Windows =
systems.  Can Optus afford to shut its entire Network down to clean out =
Viruss on a regular basis?  Can it afford to have it's entire Server =
Network shut down EACH time a patch is realeased?  (I'm aware of three =
patches Microsoft released just this week!!!)  Can Optus afford the =
backdoor security risks that Microsoft engineers into every copy of its =
Operating System?  Can Optus afford the extra IT staff that will have to =
be hired to cope with the extra demand of patching/fixing CONSTANTLY =
crashing Windows?  (Even Mac's are FAR more stable/reliable than =
Windows)  Can Optus afford it's entire E-Mail network to be constantly =
down to clean out Trojan's like My Doom?  Considering the size of Optus, =
the Company will save TENS (plus) of thousands off of its initial =
purchase price if it purchases Linux, because the Linux supplied =
Operating System is a mere fraction of the cost of Windows XP. It will =
also save itself further TENS (plus) of thousands because software =
created to run on it will NOT require individual licences for each user. =
 PLUS less RAM will be required to run each individual work station =
saving FURTHER tens of thousands.  (Not only that but each system will =
be able to run more - and crash less.)  Maintaining the system(s) will =
cost less because Linux is more stable/reliable - and patches will not =
require a reboot of the entire Network.


(Examples of successful Linux use by major Organisations)

(A) Linux is being used, by NASA, to operate the Mars Rover  (In fact, a =
large percentage of NASA hardware is run by Linux)
(B) Amazon.com Inc. (The worlds largest E-Tailer) began deploying Linux =
in 2000... Now, Linux runs its entire infrastructure.
(C) Sun and Novell have BOTH publicly announced that the only software =
they will support (besides their own) is Linux
(D) Linux is the basis of the world wide web. (Almost all Web Servers =
are Apache software running on Linux machines)
(E) It is a well known fact that Linux is being used (right now) by more =
data centers than any other O/S
(F) Telstra announced its Linux desktop project, Project Firefly, last =
year.  When the trial is complete, later this year, the system is =
expected to roll out rapidly - with the ownership reduction expected to =
be approximatly 40 per cent.
(G) THE NSW Roads and Traffic Authority is about to embark on what may =
be the biggest roll-out of a desktop open source system in NSW. The =
department
is in the final stages of assessing a project that would result in the =
Sun Microsystems open source StarOffice productivity suite being =
deployed on the desktops of 1500 front-counter staff.
(H) The German finance ministry announced that it has now installed two =
large IBM mainframe computers that run Linux.
(I) Sun Microsystems has already taken advantage of the Government's =
desire for open source, signing a four-year whole-of-government =
common-use contract in October. The contract includes Sun's Java system =
and StarOffice productivity suite.
(J) The German government has also decided to install Linux in other =
departments, including 11,000 police computers that are to be switched =
from Microsoft Windows this year in the state of Lower Saxony.

----------------------------
**So... IF ANYONE CAN THINK OF ANYTHING TO ADD/TAKE AWAY THAT WILL =
ASSIST SWAYING OPTUS AWAY FROM GOING MICROSOFT XP-PRO - MAKING LIFE =
EASIER FOR ITSELF, ITS EMPLOYEES/CUSTOMERS... AS WELL AS FURTHERING THE =
CAUSE OF LINUX IN GENERAL - PLEASE HELP!!!
