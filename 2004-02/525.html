one point that might succeed is the one about viruses/security holes.... 
etc.
the telstra problems a while ago where their mail servers were thrashed 
by viruses, was a big problem with headline news
eg. it's only a guess from my experience but the biggest problem apps 
with viruses are IE and outlook
so the more closed source and locked in solutions the more susceptible 
to these problems the company will face

&gt;&gt;The following is a draft of a proposal I'm putting together to attempt
&gt;&gt;to sway Optus (my present employer) from abandoning its current tech
&gt;&gt;infrastructure of Macintosh G3 and G4's - in favour of Microsoft Windows
&gt;&gt;XP-Pro...
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'm almost certain you won't succeed.  The decision was made something
&gt;like four years ago, and while the reasoning was all haywire, you aren't
&gt;going to get it changed at this late stage.  Literally tens of millions
&gt;of dollars have already been spent on the change over, and at this stage
&gt;it's inaccurate to describe Optus's current infrastructure as Mac-based:
&gt;It's Windows based with Macs used for legacy applications.
&gt;
&gt;If you were to succeed in reversing or changing the decision it would
&gt;not be by following the usual chain of command.  While Optus's ownership
&gt;has changed since the decision was made, the people who run the company,
&gt;that is the managers, and so on, have not.  Mind you, Optus is such a,
&gt;how should I say?, dynamic company, that the people who made the decision
&gt;those years ago won't be in the same role now, if indeed they are still
&gt;with the company.  None the less, it's a very political organisation
&gt;and you're not going to get satisfaction using logic.
&gt;
&gt;It's possible you'll succeed in getting the decision changed by gazumping
&gt;the system and going straight to Singtel, but goodness, that's more
&gt;likely to gain you a pink slip than satisfaction.
&gt;
&gt;Optus has never shown any particular interest in saving money, and anyway
&gt;the amount you'd save by using one platform over another is not great.
&gt;The total cost of hardware plus software is pretty minor compared to the
&gt;cost of training and support.  Obviously you'd point out cost savings, but
&gt;if it's the high point of your presentation you'll be wasting your time.
&gt;Remember that all of the people who run around installing machines,
&gt;and all of the people who sit on the helpdesk, already know Windows,
&gt;and probably none of them know Linux.  Remember, too, that most of the
&gt;custom software has already been ported to Windows (at great expense),
&gt;and most of the COTS has been replaced with Windows versions.  A change
&gt;of platform is going to be very difficult.
&gt;
&gt;While I'd love to see you succeed I think you've got Buckley's chance.
&gt;Worse, I'm pretty sure you'll be looking for a new job if you even try.
