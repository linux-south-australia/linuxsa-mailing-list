love internode - only had to ring support the once, and had a lovely
chat/resolution. would so far recommend highly - as a matter of fact,
have to several people:)

now, we are contemplating adsl at victor harbour for itshare - will be
looking at internode vs adam, as dsl rates them so well. there, it will
come down to what deal can we get?

&gt; Quick question.
&gt; I've looked through the archives and looked at whirlpool and have 
&gt; finally decided to get Netspace ADSL.
&gt; 
&gt; Before i take the plunge: any good reasons not to?
&gt; 
&gt; Other contenders:
&gt; iinet - read they were bad on linuxsa
&gt; big pond + optus - everyone says they are hopeless
&gt; internode - i use them for my business DSL, but have experienced poor 
&gt; service with them (they don't answer support requests)
&gt; tgp - lot of people say they are bad on whirlpool
&gt; 
&gt; I couldn't find too much bad stuff written about Netspace and their data 
&gt; caps seemed competetive/generous.
&gt; 
&gt; I also like the fact that if all your friends are on Netspace too, you 
&gt; can transfer data between them for free (i want to rsync stuff!). I 
&gt; couldn't tell if this was the case on other ISP's. Also they have 
&gt; mirrors and free gaming networks. (The one thing they don't have is free 
&gt; Internet radio).
&gt; 
&gt; cya
