&gt; &gt; Personally I think the prices some telcos charge for SMS are outrageous,
&gt; &gt; especially when you consider that the cost of delivery is so low and
&gt; &gt; delivery isn't even close to being guaranteed.
&gt; 
&gt; Given that Virgin Mobile can do 5c SMS then I'd assume the "real" cost is 
&gt; less than that.  The cost of "billing" can be and is a large chunk of that.
&gt; 
&gt; Although I understand that the USA is different in the way their phone 
&gt; system works (eg. mobiles pay for in and outgoing calls) they do seem to get 
&gt; some amazingly cheap deals compared to use (thousands of minutes per month) 
&gt; and they seem to get data chucked in for free, as opposed to the 
&gt; extortionate amount mobile carriers in AU charge.

Well, it's not all roses here on that scene, though.

For example, the coverage maps are closely guarded secrets. You cannot 
tell if the network you choose will have coverage everywhere you want it 
before you buy. You simply have to try it.

Also, the basic plans seem to be quite expensive, at something like $39 a 
month base. If you go for a prepaid phone, you can get all you need for 
light usage for about $10 a month, but with no frills.
