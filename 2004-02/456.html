&gt; I'm not sure how you imagine that would happen (excluding 
&gt; infecting a user's machine with a virus, which I already 
&gt; agreed would be expensive.) 

And you were right. Now the hapless user will be held liable for a virus
infection that spews out emails, even if the user has taken normal
precautions. That's going to get messy from a legal point of view. 

&gt;Allow that authentication would be 
&gt; required to inject a message into the network.  How could you 
&gt; hijack someone's account?

I haven't actually spent anytime thinking about how it could be done,
just that there are elements in the UCE community that will probably act
to minimise their expenses with little or no regard for the law, and
probably operating in a far-off land.

To hijack an account, you would need access to the hardware or
passwords, methods to get them, or be prepared to walk in and take it
from the user. Usual cracking possibilities exist and are easily
obtainable - remote exploits, keystroke loggers etc, not to mention the
possibility of riding in on the back of an existing virus infestation
that includes a backdoor.

Hasn't this already been done?
