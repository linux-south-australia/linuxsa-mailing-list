&gt; I'd recommend Internode for this scenario.  Indeed, I've also heard a
&gt; lot of people say that the support has gone down the drain, which is a
&gt; shame - they're a great company.  :-(
&gt; 

For the record - I've heard a lot of people (mostly our paying customers)
say the opposite - that our support quality is consistently improving over
time, and that its generally great. In particular we receive a lot of
unsolicited mail from our customers saying the exact opposite to the above.

Now this is a classic case of the old chestnut: If you like &lt;x&gt;, please tell
your friends, if you don't, please tell us.

And seriously: We don't (ever) claim perfection, but we do continue to
strive for it. 

If you could just ask that 'lot of people' you know to simply tell us what
happened (via email to <A HREF="mailto:feedback@internode.on.net">feedback@internode.on.net</A>) then our senior management
team will do their level best to fix it. Every time I've had this sort of
assertion, and dug in to it, we've resolved it satisfactorily in the
presence of an actual complaint, not hearsay. Hearsay is really hard to
respond to.

No company whose reputation is built on great support (as ours is) enjoys
hearing that sort of generalisation without knowing enough details to do
something about it.

As the person who started, and still runs, Internode, I take this sort of
thing very personally - and I sincerely mean what I'm saying about wanting
to understand and fix any instance of a customer feeling that their support
experience hasn't been what they needed it to be.

We have, sincerely, put -enormous- resources into our support teams and
support mechanisms over time, and those resources are only on the rise; We
really, really value feedback to <A HREF="mailto:feedback@internode.on.net">feedback@internode.on.net</A> telling us what
sort of job we're doing, so we can do a better one. Really.

In terms of actual statistics on this sort of thing, just to underscore my
point here, take a look at the recently released independent survey about
broadband services published by APC magazine this month (Feb 2004), and
based on a survey of Whirlpool users late last year.

In that survey, this is how customers surveyed rated their ISP on service:

Westnet 97%
Internode 93%
Swiftel 84%
IiNet 79%
DART 77%
Netspace 67%
OptusNet 55%
Datafast 36%
TPG 33%
Bigpond ADSL: 24%
Bigpond Cable: 21%

(the table lists ISPs who received more than 100 responses from customers of
that ISP - total sample size &gt; 10,000).

Many other interesting stats in the same issue.

I'd love nothing more than to bring our percentage even higher, by improving
our services even more. That simply needs us to receive direct feedback on
any cases in which we didn't deliver enough hugs. We are genuinely
interested in them. The folk at Internode, many of whom have been actively
supporting the Linux community for a very long time, do this for love at
least as much as they do this for money. No kidding.

(And besides: Which other ISP do you know that paid to have Linus dunked?)

That is my $0.02 worth, anyway. Thanks for listening.

Regards, 
 Simon Hackett
 MD, Internode
