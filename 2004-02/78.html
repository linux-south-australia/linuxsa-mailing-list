fantastic ideas michael!!

oh, and some way of quickly scanning who hadnt paid, on rush times
(like first day of miniconf when we had huge queues) scanning for that
was tough, imho - we were too flat out - i suggest having not paids in a
seperate box - if not found in standard box, you know they are speaker
or not paid:) )

a wired hub/ap for those without wireless cards - one room where they
can plug in....

and yeah, all coffee runners were great - rusty, kim, george, janet, rob
et al...THANKS, you saved our brains. setting up coffee runners was a
great idea - but it must be noted, it was informal voluntary thing among
helpers, and really bonded us as a group oddly enough:)

having paul's and my laptops there (at helpdesk) was handy - they got 
used for:
late registrations
presentations
checking wireless connections
checking out the terinet competition in progress (hackfest)
processing feedback
surfing slashdot behind helpdesk when all was quiet:)

i know having mine there was purely because i wanted to keep an eye on
what was happening at lca tec, like everyone else, but it got used by 
others far more than me!

shaun and i had our radios (walkie talkie things) with us, which proved
really handy when people needed thngs between events...rather than
working out mobile numbers and making costly calls:)

printed helper checklist/instructions/locations (took us a couple of
days to work out where things are!)

&gt; &gt; hi, i was on helper crew, and during the course of lca, we 
&gt; &gt; came up with a number of 'next time this would be great' 
&gt; &gt; ideas/lessons learnt:
&gt; 
&gt; Great idea Romana!
&gt; 
&gt; Please add:
&gt; 
&gt; Print the registrant lists with the sort key in it's own column (or
&gt; print the surname first), it's a lot easier to find a name when it isn't
&gt; buried behind it's associated christian name. (especially when there are
&gt; 30 people lined up and you are searching for an unusual name that ends
&gt; up not being on the list...)
&gt; 
&gt; Consider personalising (t-shirt, programme, nametag, etc)the conference
&gt; bags before the event. This would have helped at peak times, maybe not
&gt; at others, but would have enabled us to speed up the registration
&gt; process, and perhaps reduce errors (or create some new ones) :)
&gt; 
&gt; Terrific conference, had a ball, enjoyed rubbing shoulders with the
&gt; other helpers and the occasional kernel hacker (thanks for the coffee
&gt; Rusty!)
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Michael
