Hi again,

I'm just after some last thoughts before I wipe Microsoft from my Private
LAN forever.  As I'm writing this, I'm in the process of downloading
Mandrake 9.2...  (That said, I've already got Redhat 9.)

Seeing as I'm still in the larva stage of Linux skills, I think it'd be wise
to install _one_ version across all 4 of my existing boxes (as opposed to
different versions on each) to make maintanence/upkeep easier (for me) so my
question is this:

In the expert opinions of those that have 'played' with these distro's for
more years than I've been aware that Linux even existed - what is the
easiest to learn on as well as keep up to date?  Mandrake or Redhat?

My googeling has led me to believe that although Redhat seems to be slightly
ahead in popularity, that lead is decreasing by leaps and bounds as time
goes by.

What do I want to do with these distros will probably come into it - so just
a brief summary:

(1) Everyone knows what I want to do with the boys PC so I won't bother
recapping that one except to add that I will want to add 'Wine' and 'WineX'
to enable the box to run the boys PC games - as well as following Romana's
advice about putting  'gcompris' on. :-)

(2) The lounge box will be a minimal install that will be banned from the
Net all together. (Its sole purpose 'in life' is to interface with our
TV/Stereo to play games, TV Eps and Movies - nothing else.)

(3) My wife's computer box (Do I still call them PC's once their Windows
days are ended?) will be trickier, seeing as she only uses it to send
E-Mail's, Occasionally
surf the web and play Solitaire...  Accordingly, it's 'lot' in life is to
act as a file server to serve everything to the rest of the Network.

However - so I don't get a hard time - it'll also need to have everything a
decent Windows install does. (Office, Web, E-Mail, ICQ, Messenger and etc)
Hardware is P4 - 1.76GHz, Matrox G450 (dual) 2x 17" monitors, CD-RW, DVD,
3COM NIC, Onboard AC3 Sound and 512MB SD-RAM.

(4) My box is an AMD XP2100, Matrox G400 Max (dual) 2x 17" monitors, CD-RW,
DVD, 3COM NIC, Audigy Pro, 1GB DDR-RAM, USB 2.0 card added for 4x extra USB
ports as well as a Hauhpage TV-IN/OUT and a Firewire card.  I'll proably be
running a dual boot system on mine as I have to have access to stuff I'm not
sure (yet) are ported or will run properly in Wine (Photoshop, Dreamweaver
MX '04, Pinnacle software and etc)

Those are our present needs.  Pretty basic and simple to start off with.  As
to the future, *eventually* I'd like to set up a server farm (For editing)
as well as running an Apache Server complete with Proxy Server, Firewall and
Etc (As a seperate box/boxes) but that won't be until later in the year at
least...  For now, it's all standard humdrum - with the exception of my
system, and setting up the little ladies as a Server.

3 of 4 need to be able to access E-Mail, the Web and the Printer (hooked
into my box atm - as it doesn't have a network card) With the obvious
exception of the printer, all are plugged into a 8 port Switch - which is
plugged into my ADSL.  Oh, and all 4 will need to access the file(s) that're
sharing the TV Eps, Movies Etc as well as our music folder (We digitised all
our music and put the CD's away to keep them from the wrath of our 1 year
old)  LOL

Any thoughts on whether Mandrake or Redhat will be better (for my needs)
when it comes to ease of use, ease of installation of extra programs as well
as ease of maintanance?

David
