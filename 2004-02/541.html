Maybe it wasnt such a good topic for discussion after all. Oh well, forget I
said it.

&gt; &gt;Hey all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thought I'd throw some thought-provoking questions onto the intellectual
&gt; &gt;fire that is this mailing list.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Following along from television series' such as Big Brother and Survivor,
&gt; &gt;television stations seem to have jumped at the idea and introduced
&gt; &gt;numerous new series' based on the reality television concept. Some people
&gt; &gt;may say that it is going too far. Some, such as my high-school
headmaster,
&gt; &gt;go as far to say that the concept is evil and is contributing to the
&gt; &gt;demise of human society. Others will just follow the crowd like the sheep
&gt; &gt;that they are, and like and accept what the media dictates them to like
&gt; &gt;and accept.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Was Australian Idol and the other Idol series' different to the Big
&gt; &gt;Brother style of reality television? Does the fact that they have to be
&gt; &gt;good at what they do to win the competition rather than to simply be
&gt; &gt;accepted by the other "characters" on the television show make any
difference?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is it going too far? Do we really care what these people think and do? Do
&gt; &gt;we want to watch humans fall to such low standards as they turn against
&gt; &gt;each other to succeed at whatever it is they are supposed to be
succeeding at?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is there anything else that anyone wants to bring up? What are your own
&gt; &gt;thoughts on reality television?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I look forward to reading your responses, and to partaking in the
&gt; &gt;discussion that follows.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- Adam
