hi, i was on helper crew, and during the course of lca, we came up with
a number of 'next time this would be great' ideas/lessons learnt:
(thanks to all on #linuxsa for brainstorm to collate these;)  )

wireless cards - given the wireless connectivity available, the amount
of people who came up and asked if we had cards for sale at help desk
was ridiculous! someone setting up a stall selling compatible cards
would have done soem good fundraising:) people ended up at dick smiths
buying ridiculously overpriced stuff in depseration!

wireless access - more than one point

stalls selling merchandise - DONT leave till last day, start selling mid
conference while people fired up and wanting to SPEND. things not found
in normal handouts (professional stuff like the hats and water bottles),
and different colour to standard registration tshirts sold ridiculously
quickly - kids sizes especially well, people want to buy souvenirs. tie
pins etc...

powerbook hiring - this was HUGE hit:)

buying coffee facilities - make them available during miniconf too

recording event - a brief before hand before the event on use of 
cameras...also finding the most appropriate room for a  mini-conf 
(the IPv6 and audio were around the wrong way)...

icecream vouchers - GOOD!!!!!!

locked room - for storing valuables, poss opened and manned between events

location maps - at help desk from day one for each days talks

print facilities - costed for attendees, free to hell desk workers to
print photocopy more programmes etc

dunk people more!!!!!!!!!

want to say - we had a ball on helpdesk thanks to organisers making us 
feel wanted and appreciated:))
