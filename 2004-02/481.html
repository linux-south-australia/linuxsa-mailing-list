&gt; As to the OS X bit, I agree it doesn't make sense either - and though I'm
&gt; not in a position to KNOW, my SUSPICION is that it's more of a case of Optus
&gt; making so much money (profit wise) that they need to quickly get rid of
&gt; large chunks of it - and big investments in infrastructure (amongst other
&gt; necessities such as exective cars, trinkets and baubles) will certainly
&gt; achieve that for them...

I have had some involvement with Optus in the past, as I gave TCP/IP and 
other courses in there from time to time.

One of the attitudes I saw was that a number of people were pissed at 
Optus's insistence with remaining with the inadequate Macs they had, which 
all predated OS X. They were slow, cumbersome, and a drain on cash as they 
continually had to ensure their applications worked on MacOS and Windows 
and so on.

Perhaps what we are seeing is that the old guard have been retired and the 
new guard wants to put their predjudices into action. 

If that is the case, you might not get anywhere.
