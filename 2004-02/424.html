Ian and Paul,

&gt; &gt; Someone let these people down.

Bull!

&gt; Yep, you have a valid point. We set these people up to fail by 
&gt; installing an operating system that we know is prone to abuse from 
&gt; external sources and the developer of that OS stands back and does SFA 
&gt; to correct the mess they have contributed to.

We did? They chose what worked for them, what their friends wanted and what
their friends and family had used...it was the most sensible thing for them
to do.

/me shakes the head

They use Microsoft because everyone else does...I started eating vegemite
because my parents did. *hmmm*. My stepfather claimed that Marmite was
better...well, although I can say I don't mind the taste, vegemite it is for
me [even if Marmite has 200% more vitamins than marmite].

:(
