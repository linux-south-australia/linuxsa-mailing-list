Perhaps she got caught up in the hype in the shows such as Beyond 2000 and
watching "computing shows" on TV about Networking computing.

Two storries, true or not I'm not sure.

Someone wanted to turn their TV off but the remote wasn't working, they
couldn't find the "off button" (and yes it did actually have one) so they
resorted to unplugging it from mains.

Story two, American tourist couldn't get his drivers door open, kept
pressing the button, nuthing. Aussie bloke near by offered to help out , put
the key in the lock and opened the door.


&gt;"Well while you are waiting you
&gt; can take your computer home and use it. It doesn't need the hard drive
&gt; to run does it?"
&gt;
&gt; The Service folks in this Co are usually pretty good and perhaps this
&gt; phone person is new to the task but gee whiz, somebody needs to give
&gt; her some basic product knowledge.
