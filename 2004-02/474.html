&gt; Try and make your proposal short, sweet, well
&gt; laid out, and to the point.  There's millions of points
&gt; about why Linux is the smarter choice, certainly, but
&gt;  management won't bother to read it if it's too
&gt; long.

Thanks for the feedback Ryan.  (Always appreciated)

As to the OS X bit, I agree it doesn't make sense either - and though I'm
not in a position to KNOW, my SUSPICION is that it's more of a case of Optus
making so much money (profit wise) that they need to quickly get rid of
large chunks of it - and big investments in infrastructure (amongst other
necessities such as exective cars, trinkets and baubles) will certainly
achieve that for them...

Conjecture aside: What I DO know is that if it were MY business, I would
have (instead) purchased more RAM for each PC (minimum of 1gig each box - as
oposed to the 256mb we all have now combined with virtual RAM) ditched the
OS 7.75 replacing it with the most current version of OS X (which of course
is Unix based) as well as upgrading the Servers and purchasing an adequate
ammount of licences for one of the software proggies we all have to use -
but have trouble getting onto due to peops using more than one copy at a
time...  (Perhaps even fibre optic LAN would be nice - not to mention brand
spanking new 20" moniotors... Bah, I'm starting to excite myself - I'd
better stop)  LOL

The way I see it, the above would have saved tons of money on training Optus
staff in Micorsoft ways - as well as preventing loss of productivity (to be
trained) as well as reducing stress (noone likes to learn new ways of doing
their jobs they've been doing for years) not to mention reducing stress by
having exisitng systems work better/crash less - and a million other reasons
*I* think its a shocking idea....  Still, I guess if we don't know the true
facts, it's all academic isn't it?

Last - but certainly not least - I totally agree about the short and sweet
rule -- and just wanted to reitterate that what I sent to the group is only
a draft with thoughts splashed out on it.  (The actual presentation will be
no more than 2x A4 sheets with lots of space to make it easy on eyes.)  :-)
