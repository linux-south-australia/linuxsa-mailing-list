On Tue, Feb 10, 2004 at 12:39:05PM +1030, David Lloyd imparted:
&gt; 
&gt; Oooerrr....
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; So you've missapproriated a police name? That's good. I hope that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't entail the same penalties as misapproriating a police uniform!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What the....? I WORK for SAPol in the State Intelligence Branch as an
&gt; &gt; Intelligence Analyst. Not everyone in SAPol is a cop and in fact, my
&gt; &gt; position is SPECIFICALLY for non-cops with degrees which are useful to the
&gt; &gt; organisation, mine being in science with chemistry majors.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, so my definition of a "cop" is a little too broad for your liking. I
&gt; tend to define people who work for "SAPOL" [I trust you're not going to
&gt; claim you don't] as a "cop". I take that one back.
&gt; 
&gt; Try: SAPOL WORKER!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you don't care less - let me put it the most eloquent way I can - say
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing at all about it. You obviously care a little more than less...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Maybe so. I wasn't formally informing you specifically that I hated WH and
&gt; &gt; LoTR but was making an off-the-cuff remark.
&gt; 
&gt; You were.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was reliably informed that this list is part tech forum part social
&gt; &gt; club. 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course it is; you could even quote me saying the same thing. I have a
&gt; suspicion that I was the one who said it to you in the first place...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; In a ocial situation do you make it abundantly clear that everything you
&gt; &gt; say is directly related to the topic at hand and that you won't say
&gt; &gt; anything off-topic?
&gt; 
&gt; No, but I *do* tell people precisely what I think about what they're saying.
&gt; Yeah, true, it does have the effect that those who care to associate with me
&gt; in person socially tend to be the types of people who can cope with me
&gt; telling the blunt truth about them -- but I choose not to associate
&gt; with people who cave under the slightest hint of pressure or rudeness as
&gt; friends.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Having witnessed it first hand, I know you don't.
&gt; 
&gt; ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ROFL
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you think that you have the proof then why don't you actually call me
&gt; &gt; &gt; a dumbarse [sic] (I think you mean dumb arse - i.e. an arse that does
&gt; &gt; &gt; not speak) out in the open?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The less said about your arse, the better.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, let's leave *that* for the catwalk ;-P
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Besides, I meant it in the colloquial not the formal. Don't play
&gt; &gt; pedantics with a master of the art.
&gt; 
&gt; A master? I see...I'll play pedantics with you, good man.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Plus it's pretty clear I wasn't calling you a dumbarse. If I wanted to,
&gt; &gt; I'd have no hesitation. If you ARSEume nothing else, ASSume that.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; THEY HATES US, YES THEY HATES US; THOSE FILTHY HOBITTSES!\
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; *pmsl*
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Errr, I'm not up to speed on 'net jargon. Lil' help?
&gt; 
&gt; Pissing Myself Laughing. I've never actually done that literally although I
&gt; have been known to blurt drink on occasions. The last time was when a well
&gt; meaning old Italian lady told my friend who is:
&gt; 
&gt;  a) an ex drug addict
&gt;  b) whose partner had overdosed
&gt;  c) who had just tried to commit suicide using a huge amount of prescription
&gt;     drugs
&gt; 
&gt; that:
&gt; 
&gt;  a) using drugs was evil
&gt;  b) that a workmate had committed suicide using them
&gt;  c) that they'd make you kill themselves
&gt; 
&gt; I coped with (a) and (b) but (c) was just WAY too much. Unfortunately I'd
&gt; just swallowed a mouthful of my Fanta :(
&gt; 
&gt; So, PMSL....
