&gt; &gt; I typed in (as root): rpm -U pan-0.14.2-1.src.rpm
&gt; &gt; The response I got was:
&gt; &gt; warning: pan-0.14.2-1.src.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID aa6f367a
&gt; &gt; and then it dropped back to prompt.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; WTH am I supposed to do about that? Do I use:
&gt; &gt; rpm -U --nosignature pan-0.14.2-1.src.rpm  instead & is that likely to
&gt; &gt; generate other grief?
&gt;
&gt; That RPM isn't signed.  Meaning you can't verify the origin of the
&gt; (source) RPM.  There isn't a technical reason why you can't install it,
&gt; but there is a matter of trust.

How weird.  I thought it was complaining 'cause I didn't have a signature or 
something.

&gt; Can you assume the RPM doesn't have a "root kit" inside it?  Can you
&gt; trust where you got the RPM from?  If you're just messing around at home,
&gt; perhaps it's ok.  For a production server that needs to be up 24x7 and
&gt; can't afford a reinstall, I wouldn't.  It's your call.

I don't know about the root kit.  I got the rpm from here:
<A HREF="http://pan.rebelbase.com/download/releases/0.14.2/REDHAT_9/">http://pan.rebelbase.com/download/releases/0.14.2/REDHAT_9/</A> which is on the 
official download site, so I hope I can trust it. :-)  The system it's 
going on is personal workstation at home, so not a _major_ problem if it 
goes down - though I hope it doesn't.

Thanks for the info.

Allan
