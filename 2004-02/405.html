&gt;David,
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Has anybody else had problems over the past couple of months with
&gt;&gt; &gt; any unsolicited email?
&gt;&gt;p&gt;Probably most of us.. here are some unsolicited thoughts ...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Welcome to the big bad internet.  It's a dangerous place and people
&gt;do&gt; nasty things.
&gt;
&gt;As a way of getting around this, there's a few choices that I have:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Adam Internet do run an anti-spam tool at Adam
&gt;    - however it plays havoc with some of the mailing lists I'm on and
&gt;      accidentally throws me off them by bouncing spams coming via
&gt;      those mailing lists
&gt;
&gt; 2. Spamassassin locally
&gt;    - this is very effective
&gt;    - it is actually quite resource intensive but provided I spread my
&gt;      download of e-mails it's OK
&gt;      [I get something like 1000-1500 e-mails per day, 200 of which
&gt;*are*       spam; spamassassin is quite I/O intensive more than
&gt;anything else]
&gt;
&gt;&gt;p&gt;It sure is. However worth sticking with.
&gt;&gt;p&gt;hint: run spamd -mX  Where X is some number you can deal with (mine
&gt;&gt;p&gt;is now down to 5 and I supect falling)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 3. Clamav (a free virus scanner) locally
&gt;    - this is effective however I generally don't use it unless I can't
&gt;      convince Spamassassin to trigger spam mail
&gt;
&gt;&gt;p&gt;Absolutely agree with this Clam is step 2.
&gt;&gt;p&gt;(If you have a windows box down stream.. probably should be
&gt;&gt;p&gt;compulsory)
&gt;
&gt;Of all things, I've found that doubling Spamassassin's default values
&gt;for:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;p&gt;You put these in your .spammassasin/user_prefs
&gt;&gt;p&gt;I have also copied mine to /var/mail/.spamassasin  (still
&gt;&gt;p&gt;experimenting)[because I recieve mail from other accounts as well
&gt;&gt;p&gt;which are not user accounts on this box ... It gets complex ]
&gt;
&gt; HTML e-mail
&gt; Microsoft e-mail
&gt; Microsoft attachments
&gt;
&gt;...generally throws ALL the Microsoft virii into the bin. Admittedly
&gt;MyDoom(I think - the one that seems to have a series of random
&gt;dictionary words) got past my Spamassassin for quite a while until I
&gt;managed to get the bayes filtering to recognise it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;p&gt;sa-learn --spam   is the simplist way locally 
&gt;&gt;p&gt;Also spamassassin -r ..see below.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;p&gt;Consider running pyzor (or razor) as well (sigh) (RTFM pyzor 2X..
&gt;&gt;p&gt;needs some tuning that one ..)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;p&gt;I have script that reports (via spamassassin) to my local pyzord (as
&gt;&gt;p&gt;me) and to central (as anon.) Then tweak your spamassassin pyzor
&gt;&gt;p&gt;rating to comfort. (I feed this collection of beasts the crud spams
&gt;&gt;p&gt;that get through.)
&gt;
&gt;Naturally, I remember you discussing with me before off list how you
&gt;found it annoying that as an ISP owner you and in turn your customers
&gt;had to wear the cost of downloading all of this rubbish that neither
&gt;wanted. I get annoyed too because at the end of the day it *could* cost
&gt;me extra in fees, reduced speed and such.
&gt;
&gt;*sigh*
&gt;
&gt;&gt;p&gt;If I where running a business I think I would have to build my own
&gt;&gt;p&gt;mailserver / intercept / reporting box/ firewall..With clam
&gt;&gt;p&gt;spammassassin pyzor wrapped up by EXIM 4..
&gt;
&gt;&gt;p&gt;I would also consider tasking  the apprentice ( youngest and
&gt;&gt;p&gt;brightest) with domain searching ..report hunt and kill missions :)
&gt;&gt;p&gt;Just for the pure evil joy and revenge. (and what a great way to
&gt;&gt;p&gt;learn TCP/IP  and just about every related protocol :) nah two
&gt;&gt;p&gt;wrongs etc... 
&gt;
&gt; At the end of the day, I add
&gt;this to what you've already said: 1,2 or 3 is only a small amount. I
&gt;get about 200 unsolicited e-mails per day.
&gt;
&gt;DSL
&gt;
&gt;&gt;p&gt; Yeah don't it just piss ya off :)
I'm getting about 100 of which spamassassin and pyzor are catching about
80 to 90 % .. The annoying ones are those from my own ISP telling me
mail I had never sent has been virus clipped .. (they were never near my
MTA or my ISP's) ...Then there are the anti virus ones that come in from
"random virus scanning services"  with large "wav" files attached. ...
most annoying .. must take the hex editor to a couple and see what they
really are..

Later
