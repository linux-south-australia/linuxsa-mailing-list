&gt; &gt;Although I understand that the USA is different in the way their phone 
&gt; &gt;system works (eg. mobiles pay for in and outgoing calls) they do seem to get 
&gt; &gt;some amazingly cheap deals compared to use (thousands of minutes per month) 
&gt; &gt;and they seem to get data chucked in for free, as opposed to the 
&gt; &gt;extortionate amount mobile carriers in AU charge.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Compared to the USA, Australian telcos have mobiles WORKED OUT
&gt; 
&gt; in the USA it is a world of pain getting a mobile.. and they cost HEAPS...

Well, that is not really true ... it all depends on your situation.
 
&gt; each area has its own networks, at least in Australia you get Telstra 
&gt; you know it'll work everywhere
&gt; .. this is NOT so in the USA

Well, Helstra and Hopeless ... In the US there are several networks but 
most of them have widespread coverage, however, it is hard to find out 
what the coverage actually is.

&gt; + in the USA, if you leave the area your mobile is registered in, you 
&gt; might have to pay a lot more /minute.. i think its cos there are 
&gt; hundreds of these little networks everywhere.... in australia you have 
&gt; to pay 30c/min but at least you're free to do this anywhere... and 
&gt; you'll know what it'll cost...

Yes, you do pay more if you are in the wrong region when you make a call. 
Probably because you have to go through a long distance network or 
something.

&gt; my gf lived in USA for 5 months and the pain she went thru to get a 
&gt; mobile.. ....

Well, that was probably because of credit history problems. Until you get 
a credit history, a cell phone is hard to get unless you use one of those 
prepaid ones.

&gt; australia is MUCH better for mobile service than USA

You still have to have a credit check in Australia as well, so anyone who 
has no credit history in Australia is likely to have problems as well.
