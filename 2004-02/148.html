Hi Craig (and All),
    I would be a bit wary of giving all newusers write and execute access to
the website areas. What do you want to do? If you want all new users to have
admin rights to the website - do as you describe. If you want newusers to be
able to set up their own web pages and let apache serve them, then there is
an easier and better way.

    Apache has a method of setting a specific directory hanging off a users
directory that it will serve web pages, and another directory for cgi
scripts. It allows outsiders to get a persons web page by something like
www.somedomain/~someuser . This allows any user to create this directory (or
automagically create it with the /etc/skel/ ). The user can then put
anything they want into the directory, edit whatever in it and generally do
what users do. The best thing about this method is that Apache won't let
outsiders into where they are not supposed to be by doing something like
this: www.somedomain/~someuser/../../ which under some systems dumps the
outsider into the root directory, which is not very desirable.

    The Apache docs tell you how to set this up, well version 2.0.* does. It
is fairly straight forward, and by the sounds of it more what you might be
getting at. If you actually DO want some users to have admin access to the
website areas, you can still set up a group specifically to do so, but you
are better adding specific users to this group to maintain control over the
website, not allowing blanket access to all new users. Hope this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Linux Group and User permissions


&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I'm heading into an area of user / group permissions that is bouncing
&gt; against the limits of my experience so i thought i'd throw my thoughts
&gt; to the list for some feedback
&gt;
&gt; basically i want to setup a user who has editing capabilities to some
&gt; web pages/directories
&gt;
&gt; currently the all web directories are owned by the apache group and user
&gt; with read, write and exec permissions
&gt;
&gt; my thoughts are to create a "webedit" group of which the "newuser" is a
&gt; member of
&gt; change ownership of the relavent directories and files to the webedit
&gt; group and give the group permissions read and write access and user
&gt; (apache) permissions read and exec access
&gt;
&gt; 1. Is this just a huge jumble that probably wont work
&gt; 2. Is there another / better way
&gt; 3. Is there any advice to give on this area that anyone has
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
