With the increasing popularity and maturity of OS X, this doesn't make 
sense at all, especially considering the amount of money they'd have to 
replace not only the hardware, but the software.  I can understand 
companies migrating several years ago because some application they 
absolutely need runs on only Windows, but these days such decisions 
absolutely baffle me.

For you to present a valid argument, you need to understand the 
arguments commonly used against Linux; I'd suggest researching.  
Probably one of the largest against is support costs; there's more 
Windows techies out there than Linux techies, for example.  Many argue 
that Linux ends up costing more than Windows, which of course, and has 
been proven with real use, is absolute rubbish.  One of the largest 
for, which was especially spoken about at OCGConf, is total cost of 
ownership; determining how much that really is worth in real terms is 
interesting, but in reality, to a company such as Optus, it's probably 
enormous depending on their applications of the technology.  Linux 
removes the boundaries :-)

Your argument that Linux uses less ram may not be completely accurate.  
"Usable" desktop systems such as KDE or Gnome tend to need a fair 
amount of ram compared to Windows; they're reasonably bloated, 
unfortunately :-(

Try and make your proposal short, sweet, well laid out, and to the 
point.  There's millions of points about why Linux is the smarter 
choice, certainly, but management won't bother to read it if it's too 
long.
