&gt; It's got nothing to do with Windows or Linux, and to think that

&gt; Macintosh users used to be plagued by virii, perhaps they even still 
&gt; are. 

Being the Apple zealot I am, I can't help myself; no known virii for OS X;
most these worms, as you know, only exist thanks to braindead holes in
Windows.  This isn't the point you're trying to make though...

&gt; The problem is that users do really stupid things with their computer
&gt; and then act surprised by the nasty results.  Okay, everyone can make
&gt; a mistake, and if you do it once it is only a mistake.  If you do it
&gt; twice it's carelessness, and if you do it three times it's a habit.
&gt; I don't care to keep helping people who are habitually stupid with their
&gt; computers, and that, I think, was the point of the original article.

The problem is explaining this to most newbies.  Saying something along the
lines of "Don't open attachments unless you know who it comes from" used to
work, but what do you say now that worms that spoof addresses are commonplace?
 "Don't open any attachments"?  Of course, once you're familiar with things,
you can spot a virus a mile off, but this isn't so easy for those completely
new to the technology.

Of course, with users that continue to infect theirselves because they're too
silly to update their virus scanners, and continually click on attachments on
emails promising to make them a million bucks, I tend to agree with you.  A
large percentage of users sadly seem to be like this, though :-(

Makes me wonder whether justification of computer illiteracy is the only
problem...
