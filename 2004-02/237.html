  Comprehending the IT guy - Take One:

 Two IT guys were walking across the park when one said, "Where
 did you get such a great bike?" 
 The second IT guy replied, "Well, I was walking along yesterday
 minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this
 bike. She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes
 and said, 'Take what you want.' 
 The second IT guy nodded approvingly, "Good choice. The clothes
 probably wouldn't have fit.
 
 
  Comprehending the IT guy - Take Two:
 
 An architect, an artist and an IT guy were discussing whether it
 was better to have a wife or a mistress. 
 The architect said he enjoyed time with his wife, building a
 solid foundation for an enduring relationship.
 The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress, because of the
 passion and mystery he found there. 
 The IT guy said, "I like both."
 The artist said "BOTH?" 
 The IT guy replied "Yeah. If you have a wife and a mistress, they
 will each assume you are spending time with the other woman, and
 you can go to the office and get some work done."
 
  .
 
  Comprehending the IT guy - Take Three:
 
 To the optimist, the glass is half full.
 To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.
 To the IT guy, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
 
  
  Comprehending the IT guy - Take Four:
 
 An IT guy was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to
 him and said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful
 princess."
 He bent over, picked up the frog and put it in his pocket.
 The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me
 back into a beautiful princess, I will stay with you for one
 week."
 The IT guy took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and
 returned it to his pocket.
 The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a
 princess, I'll stay with you for a week and do ANYTHING you
 want."
 Again the IT guy took the frog out, smiled at it and put it back
 into his pocket.
 Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a
 beautiful princess, that I'll stay with you for a week and do
 anything you want. Why won't you kiss me?"
 The IT guy said, "Look I work in IT. I don't have time for a
 girlfriend, but a talking frog - now that's cool."
