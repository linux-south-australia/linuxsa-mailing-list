This looks like a good step forward and lays the groundwork for other 
companies who may have tried to lay trademark claims on generic words 
in everyday use.

 Lindows.com Gains Double Victory in Microsoft Trademark Case

 Court Instructs Jury to Focus on Windows Term in Early 80’s Usage
 While Declaring that Generic Word Status Never Changes

 SAN DIEGO, February 10, 2004 -- The United States District Court
 in Seattle has ruled in favor of Lindows.com Inc.
 (www.lindows.com) concerning key legal issues in the company's
 dispute with Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) over the "windows"
 trademark. The Court flatly rejected Microsoft's arguments today
 that the jury should consider the meaning of the term "windows"
 in its current day usage, ruling rather that the jury should
 focus on the timeframe prior to the release of Microsoft's
 Windows products, which is 1983 -1985. The Court also ruled that
 once a word is declared generic it would continue to be generic,
 informing Microsoft that no amount of marketing around a generic
 word changes the generic state of the word. To view Honorable
 Judge Coughenour’s ruling, visit www.lindows.com/genericness.

 The decision means that the March 1, 2004 trial will not go
 forward. Instead, Microsoft will appeal the Court's ruling to the
 United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The
 decision also means that Lindows.com will be able to keep its
 name indefinitely or until the final decision in the case is
 made. To be informed of the new date, visit
 www.lindows.com/trialupdate.

 "Microsoft understands the strength in our case, which is why
 they don't want to go to trial on March 1, and are again using
 delay tactics," said Michael Robertson, chief executive officer
 of Lindows.com. "Our users have helped us collect a mountain of
 evidence that Microsoft is afraid to confront."

 "The rulings are a major victory for Lindows.com. Essentially,
 the Court's ruling confirms that a company, no matter how much
 money it spends, cannot buy a word out of the English language,"
 said Daniel Harris, Lindows.com's lead trial counsel. "These
 repeated filings by Microsoft are just another attempt to deplete
 our resources by dragging these legal proceedings on for as long
 as possible. We are looking forward to our day in court, when the
 mountains of evidence we have collected will be displayed to the
 jury."
