Kiosks are Kool. 

Im doing exactly that with point of sale systems - boot machine,
straight to graphical LILO prompt, then straight into X without any
login. Presents a fullscreen graphical menu of different applications
(configured via a text ini file), and from there straight into
full-screen POS system. 

The simple solution is just to call startx from rc.local, however this
is full of difficulties  .. just try running X as non-root user from
rc.local and see how far you get ... It can be made to work, but it
requires true shell scripting horror. 

So, to get around this, Im using runlevel 2, and firing up X as a
non-root user from /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/S99startPOS. 

/home/pos_user/.profile contains - 
------------------------- 
#!/bin/bash 
while [ 1 ] ; do 
  /usr/X11R6/bin/startx 
done 
exit 
------------------------- 
Just run X in a loop 

/etc/rc.d/rc2.d/S99startPOS contains - 
------------------------- 
#!/bin/bash 

# Ensure the environment is up to scratch 
PATH=$PATH: + extra stuff 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH: + extra stuff 
su pos_user -c "initialisation commands ..." 
su - pos_user 
------------------------- 
The last su changes the UID to the non-root user, and logs in as them.
(ie - runs their .profile script) This ensures that all the paths and
permissions and everything are spot on by the time that X is laucnhed. 

If you use runlevel 5, and try to configure KDM or GDM for autologin,
that works fine, and is maybe the easiest way to create a kiosk from a
RedHat style disto. Problem is, if you start either of these login
managers, then it creates a dependency for the kiosk to have all the
latest and greatest Qt and/or Gnome libs installed and available. For
those of us looking to build a minimalist high performance system for a
single dedicated task, this is total overkill, and you want to avoid as
many dependencies as possible. 

X and everything else runs as a non-root user, and the POS application
and SQL database runs in a chrooted jail. 

Runs great on a PII with 64MB RAM, since there is no overhead for window
managers, Gnome / CORBA / KDE, etc. At runtime, X is cruising on about
11MB, the application uses around 8MB, and postgreSQL daemons chew
another 8MB, so on a good day you might be able to get away with a 32MB
kiosk machine before swapping. (I have not dared go below 64MB yet, but
it should work fine) 

The only non-graphical portion lies between LILO boot and the start of
X. Im researching ways at the moment to completely hide all of the
generous bootup diagnostics, and just display some sort of full screen
spinner whilst the OS is bootstrapping itself.  If any bootup script
fails, I want to drop out of the graphical mode, and display the boot
log in text mode. 

Ive based all this on slackware/vector, since it is a lot closer to the
kiosk setup than a big distro, but there is still an awful lot of
scripts and hacks that are changed from the basic slackware to lock
everything down. 

Now I want to be able to build these things on demand, and I dont want
to waste an entire weekend working until 4am for 2 days straight just to
re-configure everything from a stock distro each time a new application
comes up - 20 minutes per machine sounds better, and gives me time to
add a funky coat of paint to the PC that its going into. So Ive created
a distro (POSLinux) with minimal installation options instead. A system
installed with this POSLinux distro includes the tools needed to
re-generate a new variant distro. 

Huh ? How does that work ? 

You install POSLinux, change the menus and graphics around around to
suit your application, setup your application, database, networking
configuration, login accounts and passwords, custom kernel for wierd-ass
hardware, etc, etc. Thats a lot of changes, but you dont need to note
them all down so as to reproduce them on the next machine - When you are
100% happy with the efforts of your labour, run 'makedistro', and it
will create a fresh new slackware linux distribution CD which installs a
clone of exactly how your machine is setup & working now. 

Currently, the base .iso file is growing - its out to 250MB now, since
Ive decided that I cannot live without the Gimp available on a
production machine. Im sure there is plenty of stuff in there that I can
still remove without killing everything, like Japanese docs and all the
locale data in X ??? 

I still cant be hassled hosting this and paying for bandwidth charges,
so I might instead burn a bunch of CD's and give them away at a LUG
meeting, primarily for people who want to build secure kiosk / or
dedicated GUI application systems, it gives them a starting point that
at least saves them the first weekend of messing around, and provides a
framework for building their own custom kiosk distros.
