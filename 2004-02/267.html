Orthogonal Persistence isn't new.

Napier88 (<A HREF="http://www-ppg.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/Languages/Napier88/">http://www-ppg.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/Languages/Napier88/</A>) which was 
developed at St Andrew's in Scotland and subsequently worked on at the 
University of Adelaide also developed into the Grasshopper operating 
system for DEC Alpha.

Orthogonal Persistence is a very cool thing.  Makes all sorts of 
programming and design issues go away.  No files, just objects.  First 
class persistence (where you can store functions as data etc) is great.

I wrote slabs of code using this more than a decade ago as part of an 
honours project.  It's something I'd hoped would be more prevalent now 
as it solves a number of issues that people are grappling with in Java etc.

&gt; It should be.  Read the story under "Orthogonal Global Persistence" at
