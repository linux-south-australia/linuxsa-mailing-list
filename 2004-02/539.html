I wouldn't say it's 'evil', but it's definitely impacting society, and 
at least in my opinion, not in a particularly positive way.  It's hard 
to look at change without bias, though.

&gt; Was Australian Idol and the other Idol series' different to the Big 
&gt; Brother style of reality television? Does the fact that they have to 
&gt; be good at what they do to win the competition rather than to simply 
&gt; be accepted by the other "characters" on the television show make any 
&gt; difference?

No, not at all.  "Reality TV", as bullshit as it is, quite simply just 
pokes into people's emotions and supposedly makes the viewer feel like 
they actually know the character, and can relate 'better'; primary 
reason why Australian Idol, for example, has been a complete success.

The more reactive, emotionally and physiologically screwed up the 
'stars' are made, the happier the bloodhungry audience is.  In some 
senses, these are modern day Roman-era games.

Shows such as this make the viewer feel like they're far more involved 
than an acted drama, although I much prefer the latter.  They're only 
going to increase in popularity.  TV already has *enough* garbage :-(

&gt;  
&gt; Is it going too far? Do we really care what these people think and do? 
&gt; Do we want to watch humans fall to such low standards as they turn 
&gt; against each other to succeed at whatever it is they are supposed to 
&gt; be succeeding at?
&gt;  
&gt; Is there anything else that anyone wants to bring up? What are your 
&gt; own thoughts on reality television?
&gt;  
&gt; I look forward to reading your responses, and to partaking in the 
&gt; discussion that follows.
