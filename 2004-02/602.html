With OSS, when a vulnerability is found, it will usually be dealy with
in short order. 
Even recently, MS has taken months to address serious, known issues. And
this is with their new focus on security? :)

What, and M$ doesn't provide a few little 'back doors' into their
software either? At least with open source software, SOMEONE might see
the vulnerability. With M$, they could insert back doors galore and
no-one would ever (legally) know because as soon as anyone mentions it,
the question will be asked; "What WERE you doing looking at our
proprietry, close-sourced code anyway?" 

With OSS, anyone within a company (maybe a specifically tasked group)
could crack open the code and have a look. Can't do that with Windows,
can you?

I'm sensing a little 'Chicken Little' syndrome with this guy.

Subject: Open Source Is Fertile Ground for Foul Play

I'm a huge advocate of Open Source, however the following article did
incite a little concern.  It raises some (on the surface) valid points.
It would be interesting to hear some comments from the OS community.


Open Source Is Fertile Ground for Foul Play

"The nature of open source makes security problems an inevitable
concern. There are a handful of ways that malicious code can make its
way into open source and avoid detection during security testing, making
government adoption of open source particularly worrisome."
