Ahh yes there *are* those people.  If nothing else they do add comic 
relief.  If I remember this right I was called over to one who had 
decided to install Win3.1 over Win95.  I got lazy when she said she'd 
tossed the boot disk.

I wonder, perhaps 1 million 'v' pills are sold every day but only 
100,000 are actually produced.

&gt; 
&gt; I think there are degrees of the 'RTFM argument'. An RTFM for some 
&gt; obscure badly documented technical magic is uncalled for. Although a 
&gt; quick google before asking is usually appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; But there are extremes cases where the RTFM argument is the only one.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you ever read those warnings on hand dryers that advise against 
&gt; drying your face incase you fuse your eyes? Or the ones on hair dryers 
&gt; about using them in the bath. The labels are there because hospitals 
&gt; (and morgues) get a steady stream of people doing these amazingly fucked 
&gt; up things every day.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of these same people use computers. When these people aren't 
&gt; electrocuting themselves or fusing their eyeballs they spend most of 
&gt; their time opening virus attachments, typing their credit card numbers 
&gt; in response to emails from "their bank", installing "Microsoft Updates", 
&gt;  forwarding chain mails and ordering viagra of the internet.
&gt; 
&gt; It is apparently illegal to kill these people. Although we read the 
&gt; Darwin Awards with glee when they choose to remove themselves from the 
&gt; gene pool of their own free will. So those of us who do IT support 
&gt; choose to bitch endlessly about them instead and with some justification.

&gt;&gt; It's interesting to me this windy article is essentially a 'RTFM' 
&gt;&gt; argument.  I'm new to linux and I've seen this attitude is strong 
&gt;&gt; amongst the linux online community.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I feel it's one of the reasons many ppl evade linux.  Ultimately it's 
&gt;&gt; about what you want to do with your time and effort.  Linux users tend 
&gt;&gt; to be quite competant with computing because they spend the vast 
&gt;&gt; amount of time learning all those details.  Mechanics, for example, 
&gt;&gt; are good at their work because of their time and effort.  I wonder if, 
&gt;&gt; for example,  'RTFM' Zealots read their car manuals thus evading their 
&gt;&gt; mates wasting time fixing their stupid mistakes.
