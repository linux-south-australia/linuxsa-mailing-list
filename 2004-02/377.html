David,

&gt; &gt; Has anybody else had problems over the past couple of months with
&gt; &gt; any unsolicited email?
Probably most of us.. here are some unsolicited thoughts ...
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome to the big bad internet.  It's a dangerous place and people do
&gt; nasty things.

As a way of getting around this, there's a few choices that I have:

 1. Adam Internet do run an anti-spam tool at Adam
    - however it plays havoc with some of the mailing lists I'm on and
      accidentally throws me off them by bouncing spams coming via those
      mailing lists

 2. Spamassassin locally
    - this is very effective
    - it is actually quite resource intensive but provided I spread my
      download of e-mails it's OK
      [I get something like 1000-1500 e-mails per day, 200 of which
*are*       spam; spamassassin is quite I/O intensive more than anything
else]

It sure is. However worth sticking with.
hint: run spamd -mX  Where X is some number you can deal with (mine is
now down to 5 and I supect falling)


 3. Clamav (a free virus scanner) locally
    - this is effective however I generally don't use it unless I can't
      convince Spamassassin to trigger spam mail

Absolutely agree with this Clam is step 2.
(If you have a windows box down stream.. probably should be compulsory)

Of all things, I've found that doubling Spamassassin's default values
for:

You put these in your .spammassasin/user_prefs
I have also copied mine to /var/mail/.spamassasin  (still experimenting)
[because I recieve mail from other accounts as well which are not user
accounts on this box ... It gets complex ]

 HTML e-mail
 Microsoft e-mail
 Microsoft attachments

...generally throws ALL the Microsoft virii into the bin. Admittedly
MyDoom(I think - the one that seems to have a series of random
dictionary words) got past my Spamassassin for quite a while until I
managed to get the bayes filtering to recognise it.

sa-learn --spam   is the simplist way locally 
Also spamassassin -r ..see below.

Consider running pyzor (or razor) as well (sigh) (RTFM pyzor 2X.. needs
some tuning that one ..)

I have script that reports (via spamassassin) to my local pyzord (as
me) and to central (as anon.) Then tweak your spamassassin pyzor rating
to comfort. (I feed this collection of beasts the crud spams that get
through.)

Naturally, I remember you discussing with me before off list how you
found it annoying that as an ISP owner you and in turn your customers
had to wear the cost of downloading all of this rubbish that neither
wanted. I get annoyed too because at the end of the day it *could* cost
me extra in fees, reduced speed and such.

*sigh*

If I where running a business I think I would have to build my own
mailserver / intercept / reporting box/ firewall..With clam
spammassassin pyzor wrapped up by EXIM 4..

I would also consider tasking  the apprentice ( youngest and brightest)
with domain searching ..report hunt and kill missions :) Just for the
pure evil joy and revenge. (and what a great way to learn TCP/IP  and
just about every related protocol :) nah two wrongs etc... 

 At the end of the day, I add
this to what you've already said: 1,2 or 3 is only a small amount. I get
about 200 unsolicited e-mails per day.

DSL

Yeah don't it just piss ya off :)
