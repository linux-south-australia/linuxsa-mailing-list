&gt; &gt;&gt; It looks like the group had a brief sojourn writing a CVS "replacement"
&gt; &gt;&gt; (www.opencm.org) which is what piqued my interest in EROS again
&gt; &gt;&gt; recently, so once I have opencm up and running I'll give it another
&gt; &gt;&gt; whirl, and may actually contribute something to it.  I think it
&gt; &gt;&gt; shows a lot of promise if it can get a sufficient critical mass of
&gt; &gt;&gt; Open Source enthusiasts.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; At Panasas we use Perforce.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah.  My original "support" comments were directed at EROS, but opencm
&gt; could probably do with some support as well.  They admit they have some
&gt; performace issues with certain operations, and as yet don't support
&gt; disconnected operations (which is the pricipal reason I was looking at
&gt; it, alas), but the fine grained authentication and the use of
&gt; certificates for authorisation interested me.
&gt; 
&gt; They also made the following comment:  "The Perforce system is a
&gt; commercial product, but is licensed at no charge for use on open source
&gt; projects. To all appearances, Perforce is a good product, but we have
&gt; commercial collaborators and a need to manage open but unreleased code.
&gt; The Perforce license does not support this.", which they didn't detail
&gt; any further than that.

That is correct. Any commercial use requires a licence, and they are not 
cheap. Bitkeeper is another case where a licence is required for 
commercial use.

If I was involved in another start-up, I would suggest the use of an 
open-source alternative to Perforce if at all possible. Subversion perhaps 
or something else. However, I would not give up the ability to do cheap 
and easy branching. It is just so useful with a big project (80 
engineers).
